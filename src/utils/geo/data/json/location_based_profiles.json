          "abstract": "ObjectiveHispanic/Latino individuals in the U.S. have the highest prevalence of undiagnosed and untreated diabetes and are at increased risk for cognitive impairment. In this study, we examine glycemic control in relation to cognitive aging and impairment in a large prospective cohort of middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals of diverse heritages.Research design and methodsStudy of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) is a Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) ancillary study. HCHS/SOL is a multisite (Bronx, NY; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; and San Diego, CA), probability sampled prospective cohort study. SOL-INCA enrolled 6,377 diverse Hispanic/Latino individuals aged 50 years and older (2016-2018). The primary outcomes were cognitive function, 7-year cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The primary glycemia exposure variables were measured from fasting blood samples collected at HCHS/SOL visit 1 (2008-2011).ResultsVisit 1 mean age was 56.5 years \u00c2\u00b1 8.2 SD, and the average glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) was 6.12% (43.5 \u00c2\u00b1 14.6 mmol/mol). After covariate adjustment, higher HbA1c was associated with accelerated 7-year global (b = -0.045; 95% CI -0.070; -0.021; in z score units) and executive cognitive decline and a higher prevalence of MCI (odds ratio 1.20; 95% CI 1.11; 1.29).ConclusionsElevated HbA1c levels were associated with 7-year executive cognitive decline and increased MCI risk among diverse middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals. Our findings indicate that poor glycemic control in midlife may pose significant risks for cognitive decline and MCI later in life among Hispanic/Latino individuals of diverse heritages."

          "abstract": "Deforestation in mid- to high latitudes is hypothesized to have the potential to cool the Earth's surface by altering biophysical processes. In climate models of continental-scale land clearing, the cooling is triggered by increases in surface albedo and is reinforced by a land albedo-sea ice feedback. This feedback is crucial in the model predictions; without it other biophysical processes may overwhelm the albedo effect to generate warming instead. Ongoing land-use activities, such as land management for climate mitigation, are occurring at local scales (hectares) presumably too small to generate the feedback, and it is not known whether the intrinsic biophysical mechanism on its own can change the surface temperature in a consistent manner. Nor has the effect of deforestation on climate been demonstrated over large areas from direct observations. Here we show that surface air temperature is lower in open land than in nearby forested land. The effect is 0.85 \u00c2\u00b1 0.44 K (mean \u00c2\u00b1 one standard deviation) northwards of 45\u00c2\u00b0 N and 0.21 \u00c2\u00b1 0.53 K southwards. Below 35\u00c2\u00b0 N there is weak evidence that deforestation leads to warming. Results are based on comparisons of temperature at forested eddy covariance towers in the USA and Canada and, as a proxy for small areas of cleared land, nearby surface weather stations. Night-time temperature changes unrelated to changes in surface albedo are an important contributor to the overall cooling effect. The observed latitudinal dependence is consistent with theoretical expectation of changes in energy loss from convection and radiation across latitudes in both the daytime and night-time phase of the diurnal cycle, the latter of which remains uncertain in climate models."

          "abstract": "Conservative tracer experiments can provide information useful for characterizing various subsurface transport properties. This study examines the effectiveness of three different types of transport observations for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of a three-dimensional site-specific groundwater flow and transport model: conservative tracer breakthrough curves (BTCs), first temporal moments of BTCs (m1), and tracer cumulative mass discharge (Md) through control planes combined with hydraulic head observations (h). High-resolution data obtained from a 410-day controlled field experiment at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California (USA), have been used. In this experiment, bromide was injected to create two adjacent plumes monitored at six different transects (perpendicular to groundwater flow) with a total of 162 monitoring wells. A total of 133 different observations of transient hydraulic head, 1,158 of BTC concentration, 23 of first moment, and 36 of mass discharge were used for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of nine flow and transport parameters. The importance of each group of transport observations in estimating these parameters was evaluated using sensitivity analysis, and five out of nine parameters were calibrated against these data. Results showed the advantages of using temporal moment of conservative tracer BTCs and mass discharge as observations for inverse modeling."

          "abstract": "The emergent practice of applied river restoration uses best available equipment and contouring methods to construct detailed designs with some features at scales as small as 0.5-m relief. As part of adaptive management, it is necessary to determine the practicability of design features and construction methods before widespread adoption. In this study, we compared design versus as-built topography for five salmonid spawning habitat rehabilitation projects at riffle-pool geomorphic units on the lower Mokelumne River, California, USA. These were built instream using rubber tire front loaders. Digital elevation models (DEMs) of each site were produced for pre-project, design and as-built conditions. DEM differencing was used to compare the as-built surface against corresponding design surfaces at each site to identify deviations. Causes of each identified deviation were assessed based on subjective observations by a team during construction. Across the projects, 70% of as-built topography was within \u00c2\u00b1 0.15m of design specifications. Of the 30% deviating from the design, 41% was overfilled and 59% underfilled. The 30% of rehabilitated channel area that deviated from designs did not affect predicted areas of high-quality spawning habitat. On-site factors that hindered accurate construction of designs included front loader fording depth, poor operator elevation estimation, operator spatial disorientation and wood obstructions. In addition, funding and project management uncertainties caused gravel supply deficits and gravel bulk density estimation errors. It is concluded that constructing broad (>0.5-m relief) features of process-based salmonid spawning habitat rehabilitation projects by gravel augmentation is practicable. However, uncertainties attributed to human error and available methods inhibit detailed (<0.5-m relief) rehabilitation. Despite uncertainties, limitations and errors, following the recommendations reported in this study would improve the as-built adherence to design specifications of future projects. \u00c2\u00a9 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd."

          "abstract": "Landscape fragmentation due to urban development, transportation infrastructure, and agriculture poses a threat to environmental integrity. There is a need to quantify the level of landscape fragmentation in an ecologically meaningful way for inclusion in planning and decision-making. Effective mesh size (meff) is an ecologically relevant metric that quantifies landscape fragmentation based on the probability that two randomly chosen points in a region are located in the same non-fragmented patch. We investigated variation in meff measured by transportation districts, municipal counties, and six spatial levels of watersheds within the state of California. Four fragmentation geometries were developed by overlaying highways, roads, urbanized areas, agricultural areas, and natural fragmenting features. Two meff calculation methods were compared: one where planning unit boundaries fragment the landscape (CUT), the other allowing for cross-boundary connections (CBC). The CUT procedure always produced lower meff values than CBC, with greater differences occurring in smaller planning units, confirming the bias introduced using boundaries with landscape metrics. Calculated meff values varied from 0 to 20 885 km2 across 6994 units in California. Roads contributed the most to fragmentation, while agriculture contributed little, as California's agricultural areas are already heavily fragmented by roads. This paper provides a systematic, quantitative, and intuitive method for transportation, land use and environmental planners to analyze cumulative impacts of multiple fragmenting features across a range of spatial scales within a variety of planning units. This approach could be used for analyzing the impact of future land development scenarios, and integrated into regional planning processes. \u00c2\u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

          "abstract": "BackgroundWe previously showed, in two separate cohorts, that high-risk infants who were later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder had abnormally high extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume from age 6-24 months. The presence of increased extra-axial CSF volume preceded the onset of behavioural symptoms of autism and was predictive of a later diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. In this study, we aimed to establish whether increased extra-axial CSF volume is found in a large, independent sample of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, whether extra-axial CSF remains abnormally increased beyond infancy, and whether it is present in both normal-risk and high-risk children with autism.MethodsIn this case-control MRI study, children with autism spectrum disorder or with typical development aged 2-4 years were recruited from the community to the UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project, based in Sacramento, CA, USA. The autism spectrum disorder group comprised children with autism spectrum disorder who were either normal risk (ie, from simplex families) or high risk (ie, from multiplex families). Measurements of extra-axial CSF volume, brain volume, head circumference, sleep problems, and familial risk status were derived from MRI and behavioural assessments. We applied a previously validated machine learning algorithm based on extra-axial CSF volume, brain volume, age, and sex to the current dataset.FindingsBetween July 20, 2007, and Dec 13, 2012, 159 children with autism spectrum disorder (132 male, 27 female) and 77 with typical development (49 male, 28 female) underwent MRI scans. The autism spectrum disorder group had an average of 15\u00c2\u00b71% more extra-axial CSF than controls after accounting for differences in brain volume, weight, age, and sex (least-squares mean 116\u00c2\u00b774 cm3 [SE 3\u00c2\u00b733] in autism group vs 101\u00c2\u00b740 cm3 [3\u00c2\u00b793] in typical development group; p=0\u00c2\u00b7007; Cohen's d = 0\u00c2\u00b739). Subgroups of normal-risk (n=132) and high-risk (n=27) children with autism spectrum disorder had nearly identical extra-axial CSF volumes (p=0\u00c2\u00b778), and both subgroups had significantly greater volumes than controls. Both extra-axial CSF volume (p=0\u00c2\u00b7004) and brain volume (p<0\u00c2\u00b70001) uniquely contributed to enlarged head circumference in the autism spectrum disorder group (p=0\u00c2\u00b704). Increased extra-axial CSF volume was associated with greater sleep disturbances (p=0\u00c2\u00b703) and lower non-verbal ability (p=0\u00c2\u00b704). The machine learning algorithm correctly predicted autism spectrum disorder diagnosis with a positive predictive value of 83% (95% CI 76\u00c2\u00b72-88\u00c2\u00b73).InterpretationIncreased extra-axial CSF volume is a reliable brain anomaly that has now been found in three independent cohorts, comprising both high-risk and normal-risk children with autism spectrum disorder. Increased extra-axial CSF volume is detectable using conventional structural MRI scans from infancy through to age 3 years. These results suggest that increased extra-axial CSF volume could be an early stratification biomarker of a biologically based subtype of autism that might share a common underlying pathophysiology.FundingUS National Institutes of Health."

This study looks at the VMT of different vehicle types in the survey including plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and semi-automated BEVs. This comparison reveals that semi-automated BEVs have significantly higher VMT compared to other vehicle types. Least squares regression is used to understand VMT in semi-automated BEVs further. This reveals a significant relationship between commute distance, age, household income, house type, and the frequency of autopilot use, and annual VMT. It is possible that the results are showing a self-selection causality as owners of these vehicles already drove more prior to them selecting a semi-automated BEV. Nevertheless, this model indicates that as the frequency of autopilot use increases, so does annual VMT. Due to the potential for two ways causality this study cannot determine whether there is a causal relationship between the use of semi-automated vehicle technology and additional VMT. It is hoped that this first look at the impact of partially-automated BEVs will encourage more research and debate in this area with the aim of improving policy responses to partially and fully automated vehicles."

          "abstract": "In estuary and coastal systems, human demand for freshwater, climate change-driven precipitation variability, and extreme weather impact salinity levels, reducing connectivity between mesohaline coastal fish populations and potentially contributing to genomic divergence. We examined gill transcriptome responses to salinity in wild-caught juveniles from two populations of Sacramento splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus), a species of conservation concern that is endemic to the San Francisco Estuary, USA, and the lower reaches of its tributaries. Recent extreme droughts have led to salinities above the tolerance limits for this species, creating a migration barrier between these populations, which potentially contributed to population divergence. We identified transcripts involved in a conserved response to salinity; however, the more salinity-tolerant San Pablo population had greater transcriptome plasticity (3.6-fold more transcripts responded than the Central Valley population) and a response consistent with gill remodeling after 168&nbsp;hr of exposure to elevated salinity. The reorganization of the gill in response to changing osmotic gradients is a process critical for acclimation and would facilitate enhanced salinity tolerance. We detected an upregulation of receptors that control the Wnt (wingless-type) cell signaling pathway that may be required for an adaptive response to increases in salinity, patterns not observed in the relatively salinity-sensitive Central Valley population. We detected 62 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding regions of 26 transcripts that differed between the populations. Eight transcripts that contained SNPs were associated with immune responses, highlighting the importance of diversity in immune gene sequences as a defining characteristic of genomic divergence between these populations. Our data demonstrate that these populations have divergent transcriptomic responses to salinity, which is consistent with observed physiological differences in salinity tolerance."

          "abstract": "There is an extensive literature establishing, validating, and quantifying a wide range of responses of fishes to fasting. Our study complements this work by comparing fed and unfed treatments of hatchery-raised Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus)-an imperiled fish that is endemic to the San Francisco Estuary and its tributaries in California, USA-across a diverse suite of endpoints over a two-month time series. The experiment was conducted at 15.9\u00c2\u00b0C, and individuals were sampled at 12 time points as starvation became increasingly severe. We found that hepatosomatic index and condition factor were relatively sensitive to starvation, becoming significantly depressed at Day 4 and 7, respectively. Histological analysis of liver showed elevated cytoplasmic inclusion bodies at Day 7, followed by increased glycogen depletion, single cell necrosis, and hydropic vacuolar degeneration at Day 14, 21, and 28, respectively. Of four antioxidants measured, glutathione decreased at Day 4, superoxide dismutase increased at Day 14, catalase increased at Day 56, and glutathione peroxidase was not affected by starvation. The net result was a ~2-fold increase in lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) in fasted fish that was highly inconsistent through time. RNA to DNA ratio and triglycerides in muscle were relatively insensitive to starvation, only consistently decreasing with fasting after mortality began increasing in the 'No Feeding' treatment, at Day 21. Together, these results suggest that Delta Smelt mobilize hepatic energy stores far more rapidly than lipids in muscle when subjected to fasting, leading to rapid atrophy of liver and the development of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies-possibly autophagosomes-in hepatocytes."

We applied log-linear (Poisson) event-history regression models for clustered person-period data to adjust for sociodemographic variables and pre-procedure health status when examining associations between these contraceptive procedures and claims related to contraceptive failure, complications, and pain in the first year post-procedure.Key resultsWe identified 35,705 patients who had a levonorgestrel IUC placed, 23,628 patients who had a copper IUC placed, and 23,965 patients who underwent laparoscopic tubal ligation. In unadjusted analyses, rates of pregnancy within 1 year were similar following levonorgestrel IUC (2.40%) or copper IUC placement (2.99%) or tubal ligation (2.64%). In adjusted analyses, compared to tubal ligation, pregnancy was less common following placement of a levonorgestrel IUC (adj IRR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-0.82) and similar with placement of a copper IUC (adj IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82-1.05). Procedural complications such as infection (0.35% vs. 2.91%) were significantly less common with IUC placement than tubal ligation. Claims for pelvic and abdominal pain decreased in frequency with time since all procedures; 6 to 12 months post-procedure, pelvic pain claims were less common after levonorgestrel IUC (adj IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.65-0.73) or copper IUC placement (adj IRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66-0.75) than tubal ligation.ConclusionsIUC appears at least as effective as laparoscopic tubal ligation at 1-year post-procedure with lower rates of infection and pelvic pain 6 to 12 months post-procedure.Clinical trial registrationNCT03438682."

          "abstract": "Deforestation in mid- to high latitudes is hypothesized to have the potential to cool the Earth's surface by altering biophysical processes. In climate models of continental-scale land clearing, the cooling is triggered by increases in surface albedo and is reinforced by a land albedo-sea ice feedback. This feedback is crucial in the model predictions; without it other biophysical processes may overwhelm the albedo effect to generate warming instead. Ongoing land-use activities, such as land management for climate mitigation, are occurring at local scales (hectares) presumably too small to generate the feedback, and it is not known whether the intrinsic biophysical mechanism on its own can change the surface temperature in a consistent manner. Nor has the effect of deforestation on climate been demonstrated over large areas from direct observations. Here we show that surface air temperature is lower in open land than in nearby forested land. The effect is 0.85 \u00c2\u00b1 0.44 K (mean \u00c2\u00b1 one standard deviation) northwards of 45\u00c2\u00b0 N and 0.21 \u00c2\u00b1 0.53 K southwards. Below 35\u00c2\u00b0 N there is weak evidence that deforestation leads to warming. Results are based on comparisons of temperature at forested eddy covariance towers in the USA and Canada and, as a proxy for small areas of cleared land, nearby surface weather stations. Night-time temperature changes unrelated to changes in surface albedo are an important contributor to the overall cooling effect. The observed latitudinal dependence is consistent with theoretical expectation of changes in energy loss from convection and radiation across latitudes in both the daytime and night-time phase of the diurnal cycle, the latter of which remains uncertain in climate models."

The domestic dog has been suggested as a model to investigate normal variation in attention, hyperactivity, and impulsive behaviours impaired in Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). The human ADHD Rating Scale, modified for dogs and using owner-directed surveys, was applied in a European sample. We asked whether findings would be replicated utilizing an Internet survey in a novel sample, where unassisted survey completion, participant attitudes and breeds might affect previous findings.MethodsUsing a slightly modified version of the prior survey, we collected responses (n = 1030, 118 breeds representing 7 breed groups) primarily in the United States and Canada. This study was conducted using an Internet survey mechanism.ResultsReliability analyses confirmed two scales previously identified for dogs (inattention [IA], hyperactivity-impulsivity [HA-IM]). Models including age, training status, and breed group accounted for very little variance in subscales, with no effect of gender.ConclusionsThe factor invariance demonstrated in these findings confirms that owner report, using this modified human questionnaire, provides dog scores according to \"inattention\" and \"hyperactivity-impulsivity\" axes. Further characterization of naturally occurring variability of attention, activity, and impulsivity in domestic dogs may provide insight into genetic backgrounds underlying behaviours impaired in attention and associated disorders."

          "abstract": "Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 \u00c2\u00b0C/16 \u00c2\u00b0C and cool = 8 \u00c2\u00b0C/4 \u00c2\u00b0C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth-dormancy transition-including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange-within two provenances of white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests."

Several species of Babesia cause babesiosis in terrestrial vertebrates, including humans. A one-day clinic was held in Ontario, Canada, to see if a red blood cell parasite, which is present in blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, is present in humans. Based on PCR testing and DNA sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene, we unveiled B. odocoilei in two of 19 participants. DNA amplicons from these two patients are almost identical matches with the type strains of B. odocoilei in GenBank. In addition, the same two human subjects had the hallmark symptoms of human babesiosis, including night sweats, chills, fevers, and profound fatigue. Based on symptoms and molecular identification, we provide substantive evidence that B. odocoilei is pathogenic to humans. Dataset reveals that B. odocoilei serologically cross-reacts with Babesia duncani. Clinicians must realize that there are more than two Babesia spp. in North America that cause human babesiosis.

Dependency on field size, depth, dose, dose rate, and temperature were evaluated in a water tank and compared to calibration data from commissioning and annual QA. Angularity was evaluated with a 3D printed phantom. The clinical evaluation was first performed in two cadaver dogs, and then in three companion animal dogs receiving radiation therapy for nasal tumors. A treatment planning CT scan was performed for cadavers and clinical patients. Prior to treatment, the probe was inserted into the radiation field. Radiation was then delivered and measured with the scintillator. For cadavers, the treatment was repeated after making an intentional shift in patient position to simulate a treatment error.ResultsIn the preclinical measurements the dose differed from annual measurements as follows: field size -0.77 to 0.43%, depth dose -0.36 to 1.14%, dose -0.54 to 2.93%, dose rate 0.3 to 3.6%, and angularity -1.18 to 0.01%. Temperature dependency required a correction factor of 0.11%/\u00c2\u00b0C. In the two cadavers, the dose differed by -1.17 to 0.91%. The device correctly detected the treatment error when the heads were intentionally laterally shifted. In three canine clinical patients treated in multiple fractions, the detected dose ranged from 98.33 to 103.15%.ConclusionResults of this new device are promising although more work is necessary to fully validate it for clinical dosimetry."

          "abstract": "Wildland fires in Southern California can be divided into two categories: fall fires, which are typically driven by strong offshore Santa Ana winds, and summer fires, which occur with comparatively weak onshore winds and hot and dry weather. Both types of fire contribute significantly to annual burned area and economic loss. An improved understanding of the relationship between Southern California's meteorology and fire is needed to improve predictions of how fire will change in the future and to anticipate management needs. We used output from a regional climate model constrained by reanalysis observations to identify Santa Ana events and partition fires into those occurring during periods with and without Santa Ana conditions during 1959\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2009. We then developed separate empirical regression models for Santa Ana and non-Santa Ana fires to quantify the effects of meteorology on fire number and size. These models explained approximately 58% of the seasonal and interannual variation in the number of Santa Ana fires and 36% of the variation in non-Santa Ana fires. The number of Santa Ana fires increased during years when relative humidity during Santa Ana events and fall precipitation were below average, indicating that fuel moisture is a key controller of ignition. Relative humidity strongly affected Santa Ana fire size. Cumulative precipitation during the previous three winters was significantly correlated with the number of non-Santa Ana fires, presumably through increased fine fuel density and connectivity between infrastructure and nearby vegetation. Both relative humidity and the preceding wet season precipitation influenced non-Santa Ana fire size. Regression models driven by meteorology explained 57% of the temporal variation in Santa Ana burned area and 22% of the variation in non-Santa Ana burned area. The area burned by non-Santa Ana fires has increased steadily by 1.7% year\u00e2\u02c6\u20191&nbsp;since 1959 (p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.006); the occurrence of extremely large Santa Ana fires has increased abruptly since 2003. Our results underscore the need to separately consider the fuel and meteorological controls on Santa Ana and non-Santa Ana fires when projecting climate change impacts on regional fire."

          "abstract": "Huanglongbing (HLB) is a highly destructive, fast-spreading disease of citrus, causing substantial economic losses to the citrus industry worldwide. Nutrient levels and their cellular distribution patterns in stems and leaves of grapefruit were analysed after graft-inoculation with lemon scions containing 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (Las), the heat-tolerant Asian type of the HLB bacterium. After 12 months, affected plants showed typical HLB symptoms and significantly reduced Zn concentrations in leaves. Micro-XRF imaging of Zn and other nutrients showed that preferential localization of Zn to phloem tissues was observed in the stems and leaves collected from healthy grapefruit plants, but was absent from HLB-affected samples. Quantitative analysis by using standard references revealed that Zn concentration in the phloem of veins in healthy leaves was more than 10 times higher than that in HLB-affected leaves. No significant variation was observed in the distribution patterns of other elements such as Ca in stems and leaves of grapefruit plants with or without graft-inoculation of infected lemon scions. These results suggest that reduced phloem transport of Zn is an important factor contributing to HLB-induced Zn deficiency in grapefruit. Our report provides the first in situ, cellular level visualization of elemental variations within the tissues of HLB-affected citrus. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 \u00c2\u00a9 The Author 2014.

However, odds of Type X infection were 14 times higher (95% CI: 1.3-148.6) for wild felids than feral domestic cats. Type X infection was also linked to undeveloped lands (OR = 22, 95% CI: 2.3-250.7).

LITS experience adverse health effects related to smoking. Previous research has aggregated Asian American ethnic groups, masking important differences between groups. We sought to compare LITS rates among Asian American subgroups before and after the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) with NHWs in California utilizing data from the California Tobacco Surveys (CTS).MethodsWe combined 1990, 1992, and 1996 CTS (pre-MSA) and the 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008 CTS (post-MSA) to examine changes in LITS (<10 cigarettes/day or not smoking daily). Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, and Korean ethnic groups were compared with NHWs.ResultsPre-MSA logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, education level, language spoken at home, and use of other tobacco products found that Chinese (odds ratio [OR] = 3.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.19, 5.21), Filipinos (OR = 3.55, 95% CI = 2.73, 4.63), Japanese (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.22, 3.27), and Koreans (OR = 3.22, 95% CI = 2.06, 5.03) were significantly more likely to be LITS compared with NHWs.

          "abstract": "Planning riparian restoration to resemble historic reference conditions requires an understanding of both local and regional patterns of plant species diversity. Thus, understanding species distributions at multiple spatial scales is essential to improve restoration planting success, to enhance long-term ecosystem functioning, and to match restoration planting designs with historic biogeographic distributions. To inform restoration planning, we examined the biogeographic patterns of riparian plant diversity at local and regional scales within a major western U.S.A. drainage, California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley. We analyzed patterns of species richness and complementarity (\u00ce\u00b2-diversity) across two scales: the watershed scale and the floodplain scale. At the watershed scale, spatial patterns of native riparian richness were driven by herbaceous species, whereas woody species were largely cosmopolitan across the nearly 38,000 km 2 study area. At the floodplain scale, riparian floras reflected species richness and dissimilarity patterns related to hydrological and disturbance-driven successional sequences. These findings reinforce the importance of concurrently evaluating both local and regional processes that promote species diversity and distribution of native riparian flora. Furthermore, as restoration activities become more prevalent across the landscape, strategies for restoration outcomes should emulate the patterns of species diversity and biogeographic distributions found at regional scales. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 Society for Ecological Restoration International."

There is a need to quantify the level of landscape fragmentation in an ecologically meaningful way for inclusion in planning and decision-making.

RAMP is a process that creates an inventory of expected environmental impacts from multiple transportation (or other development) projects within a region (Thorne et al. 2009; Thorne et al. 2014). When conducted early in the lifecycle of the projects, such as after projects are identified on long-range transportation plans but prior to being programmed, proposed mitigation can be developed earlier, resulting in efficiencies for both project delivery and budget, and effectiveness of the mitigation developed. The RAMP approach can help avoid the cost of delays and over-runs due to late and fragmented project-by-project environmental planning and mitigation, which in California has been estimated by Caltrans internal reports at $59 million per year (Byrne 2005)."

Remote sensing has been used to monitor the long-term impacts of drought; however, discriminating dead from live trees in arid and semiarid deciduous woodlands is challenging. The goals of this study were to assess and map the spatial patterns of drought-induced tree mortality in a blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodland, a highly drought-tolerant species forming savannas along the lower foothills surrounding California's Central Valley. Airborne hyperspectral imagery was used to identify the most important wavelength regions predicting drought-induced blue oak mortality. The best metric to predict canopy stress was a normalized ratio using the spectral bands 937.53 and 1100.08&nbsp;nm with a correlation with tree mortality of R2&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.83. The image prediction of mortality for nine field plots found that 16 of 98 trees died (17.9%) during the drought. We further evaluated tree mortality in 82 independent plots, and we found the greatest image predictive accuracy for tree mortality between 1% and 10%. When applied at the landscape level, the regression-based index found mortality ranged from 1% to more than 51% in oak stands with an average mortality of 10% over the entire study region. In addition, tree mortality at landscape level showed higher tree mortality in blue oaks on south-facing aspects probably because of higher insolation rates and in sites with low potential for accumulated drainage."

The image prediction of mortality for nine field plots found that 16 of 98 trees died (17.9%) during the drought. We further evaluated tree mortality in 82 independent plots, and we found the greatest image predictive accuracy for tree mortality between 1% and 10%. When applied at the landscape level, the regression-based index found mortality ranged from 1% to more than 51% in oak stands with an average mortality of 10% over the entire study region. In addition, tree mortality at landscape level showed higher tree mortality in blue oaks on south-facing aspects probably because of higher insolation rates and in sites with low potential for accumulated drainage."

          "abstract": "Wildlife populations of conservation concern are limited in distribution, population size and persistence by various factors, including mortality. The fisher (Pekania pennanti), a North American mid-sized carnivore whose range in the western Pacific United States has retracted considerably in the past century, was proposed for threatened status protection in late 2014 under the United States Endangered Species Act by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in its West Coast Distinct Population Segment. We investigated mortality in 167 fishers from two genetically and geographically distinct sub-populations in California within this West Coast Distinct Population Segment using a combination of gross necropsy, histology, toxicology and molecular methods. Overall, predation (70%), natural disease (16%), toxicant poisoning (10%) and, less commonly, vehicular strike (2%) and other anthropogenic causes (2%) were causes of mortality observed. We documented both an increase in mortality to (57% increase) and exposure (6%) from pesticides in fishers in just the past three years, highlighting further that toxicants from marijuana cultivation still pose a threat. Additionally, exposure to multiple rodenticides significantly increased the likelihood of mortality from rodenticide poisoning. Poisoning was significantly more common in male than female fishers and was 7 times more likely than disease to kill males. Based on necropsy findings, suspected causes of mortality based on field evidence alone tended to underestimate the frequency of disease-related mortalities. This study is the first comprehensive investigation of mortality causes of fishers and provides essential information to assist in the conservation of this species."

          "abstract": "Retinol (vitamin A) and \u00ce\u00b1-tocopherol (vitamin E) concentrations were measured in tissue samples (liver, heart, pectoral muscle, and brain) from Anna's Hummingbirds (Calypte anna). Hummingbirds were after-hatch year birds that were sourced from various rehabilitation centers throughout California. Tissues samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation (SD), and median ppm concentrations were calculated for each vitamin and tissue sample type. A novel analytical method was developed to analyze small mass tissue samples, with the smallest sample mass being 0.05 g for which analysis can be performed. Mean \u00c2\u00b1 standard deviation (SD) concentrations of retinol in hummingbird livers, hearts, and pectoral muscle samples were 269.0 \u00c2\u00b1 216.9 ppm, 1.8 \u00c2\u00b1 2.2 ppm, and 0.3 \u00c2\u00b1 0.1 ppm, respectively. Mean \u00c2\u00b1 SD \u00ce\u00b1-tocopherol concentrations were 6.9 \u00c2\u00b1 4.6 ppm, 5.5 \u00c2\u00b1 4.0 ppm, 3.7 \u00c2\u00b1 2.2 ppm, and 9.1 \u00c2\u00b1 3.2 ppm for liver, heart, pectoral muscle, and brain samples, respectively. Vitamin concentrations from varying tissue types were compared to determine which were best associated with liver concentrations, the most commonly analyzed tissue for these vitamins. For both retinol and \u00ce\u00b1-tocopherol, heart samples were most strongly associated with the liver samples. The results of this study provide baseline retinol and \u00ce\u00b1-tocopherol concentrations in different tissue types from Anna's hummingbirds. These baseline values may be utilized in conservation efforts to avoid hypervitaminosis and hypovitaminosis of rehabilitated and/or captive hummingbirds by providing guidelines for nutritional targets which could be assessed on post-mortem examinations. Post-mortem examination of birds and measurement of vitamin concentrations in tissues may allow for dietary changes that aid captive hummingbirds."

          "abstract": "The most prevalent causes of death in racehorses are musculoskeletal injuries, causing ~83% of deaths within the racing industry in California and elsewhere. The vast majority of these injuries have preexisting lesions that predispose to fatal injury. A 4-y-old Thoroughbred colt suffered an acute suspensory apparatus failure, including biaxial proximal sesamoid bone fractures of the right front fetlock, causing loss of support of the fetlock joint and consequent fall with fractures of the cervical and sacral spine. Cervical fracture caused spinal cord damage that resulted in sudden death. A preexisting lesion in the medial proximal sesamoid bone likely predisposed to complete fracture of this bone and fetlock breakdown. Interestingly, a comparable osteopenic lesion was present in the intact medial proximal sesamoid bone of the left forelimb, which is consistent with bilateral repetitive overuse injury in racehorses. The morphologic features of the cervical and sacral spine fractures were compatible with acute injury; no evidence of preexisting lesions was seen. Most likely, these acute vertebral fractures occurred as a result of the horse falling. This case emphasizes the importance of performing a detailed autopsy in horses that suffer an appendicular musculoskeletal injury, particularly in fatal cases when the horse dies following a leg injury."

The main postmortem findings in cases of bronchopneumonia of non-racing horses were similar to those reported previously in racehorses.

The survey assessed physicians' awareness of the law, perceived changes in patient levels of concern about breast density, and physician comfort levels in handling breast density management issues.ResultsThe survey was completed by 77 physicians (45%). Roughly half of those surveyed (49%) reported no knowledge of the breast density notification legislation. Only 32% of respondents noted an increase in patient levels of concern about breast density compared to prior years. The majority were only \"somewhat comfortable\" (55%) or \"not comfortable\" (12%) with breast density questions, and almost one-third (32%) had referred patients to a breast health clinic for these discussions. A total of 75% of those surveyed would be interested in more specific education on the subject.ConclusionsAwareness among primary care clinicians of the California Breast Density Notification Law is low, and many do not feel comfortable answering breast density-related patient questions. Breast imagers and institutions may need to devote additional time and resources to primary physician education in order for density notification laws to have significant impact on patient care."

P. ramorum is a generalist pathogen with over 100 known host species. Three or four closely related genotypes of P. ramorum (from a single lineage) were originally introduced in California forests and the pathogen reproduces clonally. Because of this the genetic diversity of P. ramorum is extremely low in Californian forests. However, P. ramorum shows diverse phenotypic variation in colony morphology, colony senescence, and virulence. In this study, we show that phenotypic variation among isolates is associated with the host species from which the microbe was originally cultured. Microarray global mRNA profiling detected derepression of transposable elements (TEs) and down-regulation of crinkler effector homologs (CRNs) in the majority of isolates originating from coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), but this expression pattern was not observed in isolates from California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica). In some instances, oak and bay laurel isolates originating from the same geographic location had identical genotypes based on multilocus simples sequence repeat (SSR) marker analysis but had different phenotypes. Expression levels of the two marker genes analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR were correlated with originating host species, but not with multilocus genotypes. Because oak is a nontransmissive dead-end host for P. ramorum, our observations are congruent with an epi-transposon hypothesis; that is, physiological stress is triggered on P. ramorum while colonizing oak stems and disrupts epigenetic silencing of TEs. This then results in TE reactivation and possibly genome diversification without significant epidemiological consequences.

Soil boxes (0.5 m wide X 1.1 m long X 0.3 m deep) were used to evaluate the ability of grass vegetated buffer strips to retain 2 X 101 spiked C parvum oocysts in 200-g fecal deposits during simulated rainfall intensities of 30 to 47.5 mm/h over 2 h. Buffers were comprised of Ahwahnee sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Mollic Haploxeralfs; 78:18:4 sand to silt to clay ratio; dry bulk density = 1.4 g/cm(3)) set at 5 to 20% land slope, and greater than or equal to95% grass cover (grass stubble height = 10 cm; biomass = 900 kg/ha dry weight). Total number of oocysts discharged from each soil box (combined overland and subsurface flow) during the 120-min simulation ranged from 1.5 X 10(6) to 23.9 X 10(6) oocysts. Observed overall mean log(10), reduction of total C. parvum flux per meter of vegetated buffer was 1.44, 1.19, and 1.18 for buffers at 5, 12, and 20% land slope, respectively. Rainfall application rate (mm/h) was strongly associated with oocyst flux from these vegetated buffers, resulting in a decrease of 2 to 4% in the log(10) reduction per meter buffer for every additional mm/h applied to the soil box. These results support the use of strategically placed vegetated buffers as one of several management strategies that can reduce the risk of waterborne C. parvum attributable to extensive cattle grazing on annual grassland watersheds."

Based on 242 samples from six commodities (basil, yardlong beans, bitter squash, okra, squash stems and leaves, cilantro), 100% of samples had detectable FCs and 20% had detectable E. coli. The mean concentrations were 0.67 log CFU/g and 1.26 log CFU per bundle for E. coli and 4.00 log CFU/g and 6.26 log CFU per bundle for FCs. Vegetables irrigated with ground versus surface water contained lower concentrations of FCs, but this difference was not observed for E. coli. Yardlong beans, bitter squash, and okra had lower levels of FCs compared with basil, cilantro, and squash stems and leaves. Sixteen (6.6%) samples had detectable levels of Salmonella serovars (Newport, Enteritidis, Agona, and Worthington), with the majority of positives found in cilantro and squash stems and leaves. There was a twofold higher probability of Salmonella contamination in samples from growers or vendors who stated that they used organic farming practices compared with samples from those using conventional farming practices. Lastly, the concentrations of FC and E. coli bacteria were significantly associated with Salmonella contamination: for each additional 100 CFU/g or bundle, the probability of Salmonella contamination increased by \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc15 and \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc30%, respectively.

          "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobiota play important roles in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of dairy cattle as the communities are responsible for host health, growth, and production performance. However, a systematic characterization and comparison of microbial communities in the GIT of cattle housed in different management units on a modern dairy farm are still lacking. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to evaluate the fecal bacterial communities of 90 dairy cattle housed in 12 distinctly defined management units on a modern dairy farm.ResultsWe found that cattle from management units 5, 6, 8, and 9 had similar bacterial communities while the other units showed varying levels of differences. Hutch calves had a dramatically different bacterial community than adult cattle, with at least 10 genera exclusively detected in their samples but not in non-neonatal cattle. Moreover, we compared fecal bacteria of cattle from every pair of the management units and detailed the number and relative abundance of the significantly differential genera. Lastly, we identified 181 pairs of strongly correlated taxa in the community, showing possible synergistic or antagonistic relationships.ConclusionsThis study assesses the fecal microbiota of cattle from 12 distinctly defined management units along the production line on a California dairy farm. The results highlight the similarities and differences of fecal microbiota between cattle from each pair of the management units. Especially, the data indicate that the newborn calves host very different gut bacterial communities than non-neonatal cattle, while non-neonatal cattle adopt one of the two distinct types of gut bacterial communities with subtle differences among the management units. The gut microbial communities of dairy cattle change dramatically in bacterial abundances at different taxonomic levels along the production line. The findings provide a reference for research and practice in modern dairy farm management."

          "abstract": "Conservative tracer experiments can provide information useful for characterizing various subsurface transport properties. This study examines the effectiveness of three different types of transport observations for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of a three-dimensional site-specific groundwater flow and transport model: conservative tracer breakthrough curves (BTCs), first temporal moments of BTCs (m1), and tracer cumulative mass discharge (Md) through control planes combined with hydraulic head observations (h). High-resolution data obtained from a 410-day controlled field experiment at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California (USA), have been used. In this experiment, bromide was injected to create two adjacent plumes monitored at six different transects (perpendicular to groundwater flow) with a total of 162 monitoring wells. A total of 133 different observations of transient hydraulic head, 1,158 of BTC concentration, 23 of first moment, and 36 of mass discharge were used for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of nine flow and transport parameters. The importance of each group of transport observations in estimating these parameters was evaluated using sensitivity analysis, and five out of nine parameters were calibrated against these data. Results showed the advantages of using temporal moment of conservative tracer BTCs and mass discharge as observations for inverse modeling."

There is a need to find high value uses for such material. The objective of this study was to characterize the mechanical properties and water resistance of medium density particleboard made from saline JTW. A two- factor factorial experiment design was used to determine the effects of NaOH treatment and type of adnesives, including polymeric methane diphenyl diisocyanate (PMDI) and Urea formaldehyde (UF) resin, on mechanical properties and water resistance of finished particleboards. To study the binding capability of the particles, NaOH treatment was used to wash the particles for removing the wax and inorganic silica on the surface of JTW. This study also characterized the effects of different particleboard densities (0.71, 0.72, 0.73, 0.74, and 0.75 g/cm 3) and initial moisture contents (MC) of the particles (2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10%) on mechanical properties and water resistance of particleboards. Water resistance and mechanical properties of finished particleboard were measured. The water resistance properties included water absorption and thickness swell and mechanical properties included modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), internal bond strength (IB), and tensile strength (TS). The particleboards made with PMDI showed superior mechanical strength and water resistance compared with those made with UF regardless of the use of NaOH treatment. The NaOH treatment deteriorated the mechanical strength and water resistance capability of the particleboards, but did not affect the contact angles between the adhesives and JTW. When the density of the particleboards increased, both mechanical strength and the water resistance were improved. Among the five MC tested, from the particles of 8% initial MC resulted in the best mechanical properties and water resistance of the particleboard."

          "abstract": "The emergent practice of applied river restoration uses best available equipment and contouring methods to construct detailed designs with some features at scales as small as 0.5-m relief. As part of adaptive management, it is necessary to determine the practicability of design features and construction methods before widespread adoption. In this study, we compared design versus as-built topography for five salmonid spawning habitat rehabilitation projects at riffle-pool geomorphic units on the lower Mokelumne River, California, USA. These were built instream using rubber tire front loaders. Digital elevation models (DEMs) of each site were produced for pre-project, design and as-built conditions. DEM differencing was used to compare the as-built surface against corresponding design surfaces at each site to identify deviations. Causes of each identified deviation were assessed based on subjective observations by a team during construction. Across the projects, 70% of as-built topography was within \u00c2\u00b1 0.15m of design specifications. Of the 30% deviating from the design, 41% was overfilled and 59% underfilled. The 30% of rehabilitated channel area that deviated from designs did not affect predicted areas of high-quality spawning habitat. On-site factors that hindered accurate construction of designs included front loader fording depth, poor operator elevation estimation, operator spatial disorientation and wood obstructions. In addition, funding and project management uncertainties caused gravel supply deficits and gravel bulk density estimation errors. It is concluded that constructing broad (>0.5-m relief) features of process-based salmonid spawning habitat rehabilitation projects by gravel augmentation is practicable. However, uncertainties attributed to human error and available methods inhibit detailed (<0.5-m relief) rehabilitation. Despite uncertainties, limitations and errors, following the recommendations reported in this study would improve the as-built adherence to design specifications of future projects. \u00c2\u00a9 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd."

National Cancer Institute-funded Community Network Program Centers in California, Florida, and New York collaborated with local community partners to conduct three independent formative research studies with diverse (African American, Asian American, Hispanic, and White) participants to explore their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about biobanking, and their experiences with the donation of biospecimens. Our findings demonstrated similarities in overall low knowledge and understanding about the use of biospecimens for research. This was exacerbated for non-English speakers. Racial and ethnic groups differed with regard to a number of factors that are obstacles for participation, e.g., continuing medical mistrust (African Americans), lack of benefit (Hispanics), apprehension about the physical toll of donating (Vietnamese), usage of biospecimen for research (Hmong and Chinese), and suspicion of exploitation by corporate entities (Whites). However, participants uniformly reported general interest and willingness to participate in biobanking for altruistic purposes, particularly to benefit future generations. This interest was framed with a strong admonition that donations should be accompanied by transparency about study sponsorship and ownership, distribution and use of biospecimens, and study information that fit participants' backgrounds and experiences. This cross-cultural regional analysis offers significant insights into the similarities and variations in opinions and perceptions about biobanking and the collection of biospecimens for use in cancer research."

We used a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the association between the pollutants and all-cause, cardiovascular, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and respiratory mortality.ResultsWe observed statistically significant (p < 0.05) associations of IHD with PM2.5 mass, nitrate, elemental carbon (EC), copper (Cu), and secondary organics and the sources gas- and diesel-fueled vehicles, meat cooking, and high-sulfur fuel combustion. The hazard ratio estimate of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) for IHD in association with a 10-\u00ce\u00bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5 is consistent with findings from the American Cancer Society cohort. We also observed significant positive associations between IHD and several UF components including EC, Cu, metals, and mobile sources.ConclusionsUsing an emissions-based model with a 4-km spatial scale, we observed significant positive associations between IHD mortality and both fine and ultrafine particle species and sources. Our results suggest that the exposure model effectively measured local exposures and facilitated the examination of the relative toxicity of particle species."

          "abstract": "Seagrasses and related aquatic vegetation have declined extensively in the U.S. and worldwide in recent years due to habitat degradation and reduced water quality.  More importantly, over 90% of coastal wetlands have been destroyed in many regions of California.  In light of this decline and the recognized importance of eelgrass populations to the overall health of coastal systems, there is a significant need to understand patterns of genetic variation in these populations.  This information is critical to assessing the ecological interactions among eelgrass and its associated species.  Furthermore, due to the priority of these systems for restoration and conservation projects, research examining the role of genetic diversity in ecosystem function is vital to ensure the success of these attempts and the future health of Z marina populations.  To address these goals, I will evaluate patterns of genetic variation within and among eelgrass populations.  This information will then be incorporated into experiments examining the linkages between genetic diversity, community structure, and ecosystem function.  Ultimately, the results of these experiments can be utilized to plan and evaluate eelgrass restoration efforts."

Two explanations for this observation are possible. 1) The current CVs are incorrect or not useful for the decision making process due to lack of sensitivity or inappropriate timing. 2) There are systematic errors in the manner in which critical values are used. The goal of this research is to conduct a systematic examination of leaf sampling protocols and their use in decision making. Preliminary data indicate that leaves from spurs with local fruit load seem to be more suitable for assessing plant nutritional status than leaves from spurs without local fruit load. In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that the death of loaded spurs may be attributable to a local nutrient deficit through out the season."

Few studies have evaluated neighborhood impact on HRQOL among cancer survivors.MethodsWe combined sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral data from three registry-based studies in California. Using a three-level mixed linear regression model (participants nested within block groups and study/regions), we examined associations of both independent neighborhood attributes and neighborhood archetypes, which capture interactions inherent among neighborhood attributes, with two HRQOL outcomes, physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) composite scores.ResultsFor the 2,477 survivors, 46% were 70+ years, 52% were non-Hispanic White, and 53% had localized disease. In models minimally adjusted for age, stage, and cancer recurrence, HRQOL was associated with neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), racial/ethnic composition, population density, street connectivity, restaurant environment index, traffic density, urbanicity, crowding, rental properties, and non-single family units. In fully adjusted models, higher nSES remained associated with better PCS, and restaurant environment index, specifically more unhealthy restaurants, associated with worse MCS. In multivariable-adjusted models of neighborhood archetype, compared with upper middle-class suburb, Hispanic small town and inner city had lower PCS, and high status had higher MCS.ConclusionsAmong survivors, higher nSES was associated with better HRQOL; more unhealthy restaurants were associated with worse HQROL. As some neighborhood archetypes were associated with HRQOL, they provide an approach to capture how neighborhood attributes interact to impact HRQOL.ImpactElucidating the pathways through which neighborhood attributes influence HRQOL is important in improving survivorship outcomes."

          "abstract": "Currently, the bacterial composition of raw milk in tanker trucks and the outcomes of transfer and storage of that milk at commercial processing facilities are not well understood. We set out to identify the bacteria in raw milk collected for large-scale dairy product manufacturing. Raw bovine milk samples from 899 tanker trucks arriving at two dairy processors in San Joaquin Valley of California during three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) were analyzed by community 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This analysis revealed highly diverse bacterial populations, which exhibited seasonal differences. Raw milk collected in the spring contained the most diverse bacterial communities, with the highest total cell numbers and highest proportions being those of Actinobacteria Even with this complexity, a core microbiota was present, consisting of 29 taxonomic groups and high proportions of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus and unidentified members of Clostridiales Milk samples were also collected from five large-volume silos and from 13 to 25 tankers whose contents were unloaded into each of them during 2&nbsp;days in the summer. Transfer of the milk to storage silos resulted in two community types. One group of silos contained a high proportion of Streptococcus spp. and was similar in that respect to the tankers that filled them. The community found in the other group of silos was distinct and dominated by Acinetobacter Overall, despite highly diverse tanker milk community structures, distinct milk bacterial communities were selected within the processing facility environment. This knowledge can inform the development of new sanitation procedures and process controls to ensure the consistent production of safe and high-quality dairy products on a global scale. Raw milk harbors diverse bacteria that are crucial determinants of the quality and safety of fluid milk and (fermented) dairy products. These bacteria enter farm milk during transport, storage, and processing. Although pathogens are destroyed by pasteurization, not all bacteria and their associated enzymes are eliminated. Our comprehensive analyses of the bacterial composition of raw milk upon arrival and shortly after storage at major dairy processors showed that the communities of milk microbiota are highly diverse. Even with these differences, there was a core microbiota that exhibited distinct seasonal trends. Remarkably, the effects of the processing facility outweighed those of the raw milk microbiome and the microbial composition changed distinctly within some but not all silos within a short time after transfer. This knowledge can be used to inform cleaning and sanitation procedures as well as to enable predictions of the microbial communities in raw milk that result in either high-quality or defective products."

          "abstract": "A contribution to a special issue on Hormones and Human Competition. The relationship between androgenic hormones, like testosterone (T), and aggression is extensively studied in human populations. Yet, while this work has illuminated a variety of principals regarding the behavioral and phenotypic effects of T, it is also hindered by inherent limitations of performing research on people. In these instances, animal research can be used to gain further insight into the complex mechanisms by which T influences aggression. Here, we explore recent studies on T and aggression in numerous vertebrate species, although we focus primarily on males and on a New World rodent called the California mouse (Peromyscus californicus). This species is highly territorial and monogamous, resembling the modern human social disposition. We review (i) how baseline and dynamic T levels predict and/or impact aggressive behavior and disposition; (ii) how factors related to social and physical context influence T and aggression; (iii) the reinforcing or \"rewarding\" aspects of aggressive behavior; and (iv) the function of T on aggression before and during a combative encounter. Included are areas that may need further research. We argue that animal studies investigating these topics fill in gaps to help paint a more complete picture of how androgenic steroids drive the output of aggressive behavior in all animals, including humans."

          "abstract": "Male parental care is an important social behavior for several mammalian species. Psychosocial stress is usually found to inhibit maternal behavior, but effects on paternal behavior have been less consistent. We tested the effects of social defeat stress on pair bond formation and paternal behavior in the monogamous California mouse (Peromyscus californicus). Social defeat reduced time spent in a chamber with a stranger female during a partner preference test conducted 24h after pairing, but increased latency to the first litter. In 10min partner preference tests conducted after the birth of pups, both control and stressed males exhibited selective aggression towards stranger females. Unlike prairie voles, side by side contact was not observed in either partner preference test. Stressed male California mice engaged in more paternal behavior than controls and had reduced anxiety-like responses in the open-field test. Defeat stress enhanced prodynorphin and KOR expression in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) but not PVN. Increased KOR signaling has been linked to increased selective aggression in prairie voles. Together the results show that defeat stress enhances behaviors related to parental care and pair bonding in male California mice."

          "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are a major public health concern and current treatments are inadequate for many individuals. Anxiety is more common in women than men and this difference arises during puberty. Sex differences in physiological stress responses may contribute to this variability. During puberty, gonadal hormones shape brain structure and function, but the extent to which these changes affect stress sensitivity is unknown. We examined how pubertal androgens shape behavioral and neural responses to social stress in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), a model species for studying sex differences in stress responses. In adults, social defeat reduces social approach and increases social vigilance in females but not males. We show this sex difference is absent in juveniles, and that prepubertal castration sensitizes adult males to social defeat. Adult gonadectomy does not alter behavioral responses to defeat, indicating that gonadal hormones act during puberty to program behavioral responses to stress in adulthood. Calcium imaging in the medioventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) showed that social threats increased neural activity and that prepubertal castration generalized these responses to less threatening social contexts. These results support recent hypotheses that the BNST responds to immediate threats. Prepubertal treatment with the nonaromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone acts in males and females to reduce the effects of defeat on social approach and vigilance in adults. These data indicate that activation of androgen receptors during puberty is critical for programming behavioral responses to stress in adulthood."

          "abstract": "California growers face challenges with water shortages and there is a strong need to use the least amount of water while optimizing yield. Timely information on evapotranspiration (ET), a dominant component of crop consumptive water use, is critical for growers to tailor irrigation management based on in-field spatial variability and in-season variations.We evaluated the performance of a remote sensing-based approach, Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), in mapping ET over an almond orchard in California, driven by Landsat satellite observations. Reference ET from a network of weather stations over well-watered grass (ETo) was used for the internal calibration and for deriving ET at daily and extended time period, instead of alfalfa based reference evapotranspiration (ETr). Our study showed that METRIC daily ET estimates during Landsat overpass dates agreed well with the field measurements. During 2009-2012, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.53 mm/day and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.87 were found between METRIC versus observed daily ET. Monthly ET estimates had a higher accuracy, with a RMSE of 12.08 mm/month, a R2 of 0.90, and a relatively small relative mean difference (RMD) of 9.68% during 2009-2012 growing seasons. Net radiation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from remote sensing observations were highly correlated with spatial and temporal ET estimates. An empirical model was developed to estimate daily ET using NDVI, net radiation (Rn), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The validation showed that the accuracy of this easy-to-use empirical method was slightly lower than that of METRIC but still reasonable, with a RMSE of 0.71 mm/day when compared to ground measurements. The remote sensing based ET estimate will support a variety of State and local interests in water use and irrigation management, for both planning and regulatory/compliance purposes, and it provides the farmers observation-based guidance for site-specific and time-sensitive irrigation management."

          "abstract": "California farmers who use reduced-disturbance tillage and winter cover cropping can boost production and improve soil health. However, some farmers are hesitant to try these conservation practices due to uncertainty about whether planting winter cover crops will deplete soil moisture in already drought-stricken regions. Our study addresses these concerns by looking at how long-term reduced-disturbance tillage and winter cover cropping, compared to fallowed soils with standard tillage, affected soil moisture. Although we found a statistical difference in total soil water content, the difference was only about 0.3 inches of water per foot of soil. On average, the soil water content of the top 0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c96 inches was highest for the reduced-disturbance fields with winter cover crops. This was especially evident during our driest field season, from November 1, 2017, to March 15, 2018, when cumulative rainfall was only 1.9 inches. Our findings show that winter cover cropping and reduced-disturbance tillage can improve soil without depleting soil water levels in row crops. "

          "abstract": "Proctophyllodes huitzilopochtlii Atyeo &amp; Braasch 1966 (Acariformes: Astigmata: Proctophyllodidae), a feather mite, was found on feathers collected from five hummingbird species in California. This mite has not been previously documented on feathers from Anna's (Calypte anna [Lesson 1829]) or Black-chinned (Archilochus alexandri [Bourcier &amp; Mulsant 1846]) Hummingbirds. A total of 753 hummingbirds were evaluated for the presence of mites by species (Allen's n = 112; Anna's n = 500; Black-chinned n = 122; Rufous n = 18; Calliope n = 1), sex (males n = 421; females n = 329; 3 unidentified), and age (juvenile n = 199; after-hatch-year n = 549; 5 unidentified). Of these 753 hummingbirds evaluated, mites were present on the rectrices of 40.9% of the birds. Significantly more Anna's Hummingbirds were positive for rectricial mites (59.2%) compared with 8.2% of Black-chinned, 0.9% of Allen's, 5.6% of Rufous Hummingbirds, and 0% for Calliope (p-value < 0.0001). Across all hummingbird species, male hummingbirds (44.9%) had a higher prevalence of rectricial mites compared to female hummingbirds (36.2%; p-value = 0.004), while juvenile hummingbirds (46.2%) had a non-significantly higher prevalence compared to after-hatch-year hummingbirds (39.0%; p-value = 0.089). On average, the percentage of the long axis of the rachis occupied by mites for the outer rectrices (R4 and R5) was 19%, compared to 11% for inner rectrices (R1 and R2), a significant difference (p-value = <0.0001). There was a marginal lack of significance for symmetrical distribution of tail mites with the mean left side percentage of long axis of the rachis occupied by mites being 16% and very close to the mean right side score of 18% (p-value = 0.003). The identification of the feather mite species was based on light microscopic morphometry, and mite distribution on feathers was further evaluated using tabletop scanning electron microscopy (TSEM). The hummingbird-feather mite relationship is not well understood, but the specialized TSEM technique may be especially useful in examining natural positioning and developmental aspects of the mites since it allows in situ feather examination of live mites."

          "abstract": "Avian pox is a common avian virus that in its cutaneous form can cause characteristic lesions on a bird's dermal surfaces. Detection of avian pox in free-ranging birds historically relied on observations of visual lesions and/or histopathology, both which can underestimate avian pox prevalence. We compared traditional visual observation methods for avian pox with molecular methods that utilize minimally invasive samples (blood, toenail clipping, feathers, and dermal swabs) in an ecologically important group of birds, hummingbirds. Specifically, avian pox prevalence in several species of hummingbirds were examined across multiple locations using three different methods: (1) visual inspection of hummingbirds for pox-like lesions from a long-term banding data set, (2) qPCR assay of samples from hummingbird carcasses from wildlife rehabilitation centers, and (3) qPCR assay of samples from live-caught hummingbirds. A stark difference in prevalences among these three methods was identified, with an avian pox prevalence of 1.5% from banding data, 20.4% from hummingbird carcasses, and 32.5% from live-caught hummingbirds in California. This difference in detection rates underlines the necessity of a molecular method to survey for avian pox, and this study establishes one such method that could be applied to other wild bird species. Across all three methods, Anna's hummingbirds harbored significantly higher avian pox prevalence than other species examined, as did males compared with females and birds caught in Southern California compared with Northern California. After hatch-year hummingbirds also harbored higher avian pox prevalences than hatch-year hummingbirds in the California banding data set and the carcass data set. This is the first study to estimate the prevalence of avian pox in hummingbirds and address the ecology of this hummingbird-specific strain of avian pox virus, providing vital information to inform future studies on this charismatic and ecologically important group of birds."

Consistent with previous reports, norBNI (10 mg/kg) decreased immobility in the forced swim test for male C57Bl/6J and California mice. Surprisingly, dose-response studies in female C57Bl/6J and California mice showed that norBNI did not reduce immobility. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed that metabolism and brain concentrations of norBNI were similar in male and female C57Bl/6J. In the nucleus accumbens of male but not female C57Bl/6J, norBNI increased phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), a putative mechanism for norBNI action. However, no differences in pJNK were observed in male or female California mice. Together, these results suggest that immobility in the forced swim test is less dependent on endogenous KOR signaling in female rodents and highlight the importance of examining the effects of possible therapeutic agents in both males and females."

          "abstract": "Maternally transmitted Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, and Cardinium bacteria are common in insects [1], but their interspecific spread is poorly understood. Endosymbionts can spread rapidly within host species by manipulating host reproduction, as typified by the&nbsp;global spread of wRi Wolbachia observed in Drosophila simulans [2, 3]. However, because Wolbachia cannot survive outside host cells, spread between distantly related host species requires horizontal transfers that are presumably rare [4-7]. Here, we document spread of wRi-like Wolbachia among eight highly diverged Drosophila hosts (10-50 million years) over only about 14,000 years (5,000-27,000). Comparing 110 wRi-like genomes, we find \u00e2\u2030\u00a40.02% divergence from the wRi variant that spread rapidly through California populations of D.&nbsp;simulans. The&nbsp;hosts include both globally invasive species (D.&nbsp;simulans, D.&nbsp;suzukii, and D.&nbsp;ananassae) and&nbsp;narrowly distributed Australian endemics (D.&nbsp;anomalata and D.&nbsp;pandora) [8]. Phylogenetic analyses that include mtDNA genomes indicate introgressive transfer of wRi-like Wolbachia between closely related species D.&nbsp;ananassae, D.&nbsp;anomalata, and D.&nbsp;pandora but no horizontal transmission within species. Our analyses suggest D.&nbsp;ananassae as the&nbsp;Wolbachia source for the recent wRi invasion of&nbsp;D.&nbsp;simulans and D.&nbsp;suzukii as the source of Wolbachia in its sister species D.&nbsp;subpulchrella. Although six of these wRi-like variants cause strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, two cause no detectable reproductive effects, indicating that pervasive mutualistic effects [9, 10] complement the reproductive manipulations for which Wolbachia are best&nbsp;known. \"Super spreader\" variants like wRi may be&nbsp;particularly useful for controlling insect pests&nbsp;and vector-borne diseases with Wolbachia transinfections [11]."

          "abstract": "Few coupled lake-watershed studies examine long-term effects of climate on the ecosystem function of lakes in a hydrological context. We use 32 years of hydrological and biogeochemical data from a high-elevation site in the Sierra Nevada of California to characterize variation in snowmelt in relation to climate variability and explore the impact on factors affecting phytoplankton biomass. The magnitude of accumulated winter snow, quantified through basinwide estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE), was the most important climate factor controlling variation in the timing and rate of spring snowmelt. Variations in SWE and snowmelt led to significant differences in lake flushing rate, water temperature, and nitrate concentrations across years. On average in dry years, snowmelt started 25&nbsp;days earlier and proceeded 7&nbsp;mm/day slower, and the lake began the ice-free season with nitrate concentrations ~2&nbsp;\u00ce\u00bcM higher and water temperatures 9\u00c2\u00b0C warmer than in wet years. Flushing rates in wet years were 2.5 times larger than those in dry years. Consequently, particulate organic matter concentrations, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, were 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6&nbsp;\u00ce\u00bcM higher in dry years. There was a temporal trend of increase in particulate organic matter across dry years that corresponded to lake warming independent of variation in SWE. These results suggest that phytoplankton biomass is increasing as a result of both interannual variability in precipitation and long-term warming trends. Our study underscores the need to account for local-scale catchment variability that may affect the accumulation of winter snowpack when predicting climate responses in lakes."

          "abstract": "IntroductionLittle is known about how incentives may encourage low income smokers to call for quitline services. This study evaluates the impact of outreach through health channels on California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) quitline caller characteristics, trends, and reach.Study designLongitudinal study.Setting/participantsMedi-Cal quitline callers.InterventionStatewide outreach was conducted with health providers, Medi-Cal plans (all-household mailings with tracking codes), and public health organizations (March 2012-July 2015). For incentives, Medi-Cal callers could ask for a $20 gift card; in September 2013, callers were offered free nicotine patches.Main outcome measuresCaller characteristics were compared with chi-square analyses, joinpoint analysis of call trends was performed accounting for Medi-Cal population growth, referral source among Medi-Cal and non-Medi-Cal callers was documented, and the annual percentage of the population reached who called the Helpline was calculated. Analyses were conducted 2016-2018.ResultsTotal Medi-Cal callers were 92,900, a 70% increase from prior annual averages: 12.4% asked for the financial incentive, 17.3% reported the mailing code, and 73.3% received nicotine patches while offered. Among the two thirds of callers who completed counseling, 15.5% asked for the financial incentive, and 13.6% reported the mailing code. A joinpoint analysis showed call trends increased 23% above expected for the Medi-Cal population growth after mailings to providers and members began, and decreased after outreach ended. Annual reach increased from 2.3% (95% CI=2.1, 2.6) in 2011 to peak at 4.5% (95% CI=3.6, 5.3) in 2014. Among subgroups with higher reach rates, some also had higher rates of asking for the financial incentive (African Americans, American Indian), reporting the tracking code (whites), or both (aged 45-64 years). Medi-Cal callers were more likely than non-Medi-Cal callers to report providers (32.3% vs 23.8%) and plans (19.7% vs 1.4%) as their referral source, and less likely to cite media (20.2% vs 44.4%, p<0.001).ConclusionsStatewide outreach through health channels incentivizing Medi-Cal members increased the utilization and reach of quitline services.Supplement informationThis article is part of a supplement entitled Advancing Smoking Cessation in California's Medicaid Population, which is sponsored by the California Department of Public Health."

          "abstract": "BackgroundIn 2016, California updated its prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), adding two key features: automated proactive reports to prescribers and mandatory registration for prescribers and pharmacists. The effects of these changes on prescribing patterns have not yet been examined. We aimed to evaluate the joint effect of these two PDMP features on county-level prescribing practices in California.MethodsUsing county-level quarterly data from 2012 to 2017, we estimated the absolute change associated with the implementation of these two PDMP features in seven prescribing indicators in California versus a control group comprising counties in Florida and Washington: opioid prescription rate per 1000 residents; patients' mean daily opioid dosage in milligrams of morphine equivalents[MME]; prescribers' mean daily MME prescribed; prescribers' mean number of opioid prescriptions per day; percentage of patients getting >90 MME/day; percentage of days with overlapping prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines; multiple opioid provider episodes per 100,000 residents.ResultsProactive reports and mandatory registration were associated with a 7.7 MME decrease in patients' mean daily opioid dose (95 %CI: -11.4, -2.9); a 1.8 decrease in the percentage of patients prescribed high-dose opioids (95 %CI: -2.3, -0.9); and a 6.3 MME decrease in prescribers' mean daily dose prescribed (95 %CI: -10.0, -1.3).ConclusionsCalifornia's implementation of these two PDMP features was associated with decreases in the total quantity of opioid MMEs prescribed, and indicators of patients prescribed high-dose opioids compared to states that had PDMP's without these features. Rates of opioid prescribing and other high-risk prescribing patterns remained unchanged."

          "title": "A three-year multifaceted intervention to prevent obesity in children of Mexican-heritage",
          "abstract": "BackgroundObesity and overweight have increased dramatically in the United States over the last decades. The complexity of interrelated causal factors that result in obesity needs to be addressed within the cultural dynamic of sub-populations. In this study, we sought to estimate the effects of a multifaceted, community-based intervention on body mass index (BMI) among Mexican-heritage children.MethodsNi\u00c3\u00b1os Sanos, Familia Sana (Healthy Children, Healthy Family) was a quasi-experimental intervention study designed to reduce the rate of BMI growth among Mexican-heritage children in California's Central Valley. Two rural communities were matched based on demographic and environmental characteristics and were assigned as the intervention or comparison community. The three-year intervention included parent workshops on nutrition and physical activity; school-based nutrition lessons and enhanced physical education program for children; and a monthly voucher for fruits and vegetables. Eligible children were between 3 and 8\u00e2\u20ac\u2030years old at baseline. Intent-to-treat analyses were estimated using linear mixed-effect models with random intercepts. We ran a series of models for each gender where predictors were fixed except interactions between age groups and obesity status at baseline with intervention to determine the magnitude of impact on BMI.ResultsAt baseline, mean (SD) BMI z-score (zBMI) was 0.97 (0.98) in the intervention group (n&nbsp;=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030387) and 0.98 (1.02) in the comparison group (n&nbsp;=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030313) (NS). The intervention was significantly associated with log-transformed BMI (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.04 (0.02), P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.03) and zBMI (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.25 (0.12), P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.04) among boys and log-transformed BMI among obese girls (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030-\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.04 (0.02), P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.04). The intervention was significantly and inversely associated with BMI in obese boys and girls across all age groups and normal weight boys in the oldest group (over 6\u00e2\u20ac\u2030years) relative to their counterparts in the comparison community.ConclusionsA community-based, multifaceted intervention was effective at slowing the rate of BMI growth among Mexican-heritage children. Our findings suggest that practitioners should consider strategies that address gender disparities and work with a variety of stakeholders to target childhood obesity.Trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01900613 .

          "title": "Abstract OT2-08-01: Personalized breast cancer screening in a population based study: Women Informed to Screen Depending On Measures of risk (WISDOM)",
          "abstract": "Abstract: \r\n\r\n               Background: WISDOM is a 100,000 healthy women preference-tolerant, pragmatic study comparing annual to personalized risk-based breast screening. The novelty of WISDOM personalized screening is the integration of previously validated genetic and clinical risk factors (age, family history, breast biopsy results, ethnicity, mammographic density) into a single risk assessment model that directs the starting age, timing, and frequency of screening. The goal of WISDOM is to determine if personalized screening, compared to annual screening, is as safe, less morbid, enables prevention, and is preferred by women. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02620852. \r\n\r\n               Methods: Women aged 40-74 years with no history of breast cancer or DCIS, and no previous double mastectomy can join the study online at wisdomstudy.org. Participants can elect randomization or self-select a study arm, and provide electronic consent and Release for Medical Information using DocuSign. For all participants, 5-year risk of developing breast cancer is calculated according to the Breast Cancer Screening Consortium (BCSC) model. Participants in the personalized arm undergo panel-based mutation testing, and their 5-year risk is calculated using the BCSC score combined with a Polygenic Risk Score (BCSC-PRS) that includes 75 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, increase to 229) known to increase breast cancer risk. SNPs and mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1, ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2) are assessed by saliva-based testing through Color Genomics. 5-year risk level thresholds are used to stratify for low-, moderate- and high risk. Risk stratification determines age to start, stop, and frequency of screening. \r\n\r\n               Enrollment: As of July 2018, the WISDOM study is open to all eligible women in California, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. To date, 23,329 eligible women have registered and 14,393 women have consented to participate in the trial. We analyzed 3,255 participants who have completed risk assessment in the personalized arm. The median age was 56 years. 82% were Caucasian, 1% African-American, and 6% Asian. 9% self-reported as Hispanic. We are partnering with health insurers and self-insured companies using coverage with evidence progression. To strengthen generalizability, we are expanding to other states. WISDOM enrollment will continue past 2019. \r\n\r\n               Feasibility: To evaluate the addition of PRS, we used paired statistical tests (McNemar) to compare the distributions of BCSC, and BCSC-PRS risk estimates around low-risk (<1.3%), and very-high risk (>6%) thresholds, the latter corresponding to 5-year risk of a BRCA mutation carrier. The median 5-year risk was 1.5% (IQR 1.0-2.1%) using the BCSC model, and 1.4% (IQR 0.8-2.5%) using the BCSC-PRS model. The BCSC-PRS model classified more women into the low (<1%) and very high (\u00e2\u2030\u00a56%) risk categories compared to the BCSC model (p < 0.001). \r\n\r\n               Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that incorporating genetic variants into a validated clinical model is feasible and impacts risk classification compared to a model without genetic risk factors. Results at 5 years will reveal if this classification improves healthcare value by reducing screen volumes and costs without jeopardizing outcomes. \r\n\r\n               Citation Format: Acerbi I, Shieh Y, Madlensky L, Tice J, Ziv E, Eklund M, Blanco A, DeRosa D, Tong B, Goodman D, Nassereddine L, Anderson N, Harvey H, Layton T, Park HL, Petruse A, Stewart S, Wernisch J, Risty L, Koenig B, Sarrafan S, Firouzian R, Kaplan C, Hiatt R, Parker BA, Wenger N, Lee V, Heditsian D, Brain S, Stover Fiscalini A, Borowsky AD, Anton-Culver H, Naeim A, Kaster A, Talley M, van 't Veer LJ, LaCroix A, Wisdom Study and Athena Breast Health Network Investigators and Advocate Partners, Esserman LJ.

A variety of feedstocks can be combined with different digestion techniques that each yields biogas with different trace compositions.

Here, we report the composition of six California biogas streams from three different feedstocks (dairy manure, food waste, and municipal solid waste). The chemical and biological composition of raw biogas is reported, and the toxicity of combusted biogas is tested under fresh and photochemically aged conditions. Results show that municipal waste biogas contained elevated levels of chemicals associated with volatile chemical products such as aromatic hydrocarbons, siloxanes, and certain halogenated hydrocarbons. Food waste biogas contained elevated levels of sulfur-containing compounds including hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans, and sulfur dioxide. Biogas produced from dairy manure generally had lower concentrations of trace chemicals, but the combustion products had slightly higher toxicity response compared to the other feedstocks. Atmospheric aging performed in a photochemical smog chamber did not strongly change the toxicity (oxidative capacity or mutagenicity) of biogas combustion exhaust."

          "abstract": "Sarcocystis neurona was recognised as an important cause of mortality in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) after an outbreak in April 2004 and has since been detected in many marine mammal species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Risk of S. neurona exposure in sea otters is associated with consumption of clams and soft-sediment prey and is temporally associated with runoff events. We examined the spatial distribution of S. neurona exposure risk based on serum antibody testing and assessed risk factors for exposure in animals from California, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska. Significant spatial clustering of seropositive animals was observed in California and Washington, compared with British Columbia and Alaska. Adult males were at greatest risk for exposure to S. neurona, and there were strong associations with terrestrial features (wetlands, cropland, high human housing-unit density). In California, habitats containing soft sediment exhibited greater risk than hard substrate or kelp beds. Consuming a diet rich in clams was also associated with increased exposure risk. These findings suggest a transmission pathway analogous to that described for Toxoplasma gondii, with infectious stages traveling in freshwater runoff and being concentrated in particular locations by marine habitat features, ocean physical processes, and invertebrate bioconcentration."

          "abstract": "The spread of Aedes aegypti in California and other regions of the U.S. has increased the need to understand the potential for local chains of Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission, particularly in arid regions where the ecology of these mosquitoes is less understood. For public health and vector control programs, it is helpful to know whether variation in risk of local transmission can be attributed to socio-demographic factors that could help to target surveillance and control programs. Socio-demographic factors have been shown to influence transmission risk of dengue virus outside the U.S. by modifying biting rates and vector abundance. In regions of the U.S. where Ae. aegypti have recently invaded and where residential areas are structured differently than those in the tropics where Ae. aegypti are endemic, it is unclear how socio-demographic factors modify the abundance of Ae. aegypti populations. Understanding heterogeneities among households in Ae. aegypti abundance will provide a better understanding of local vectorial capacity and is an important component of understanding risk of local Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Los Angeles County, California during summer 2017 to understand the causes of variation in relative abundance of Ae. aegypti among households. We surveyed 161 houses, representing a wide range of incomes. Surveys consisted of systematic adult mosquito collections, inspections of households and properties, and administration of a questionnaire in English or Spanish. Adult Ae. aegypti were detected at 72% of households overall and were found indoors at 12% of households. An average of 3.1 Ae. aegypti were collected per household. Ae. aegypti abundance outdoors was higher in lower-income neighborhoods and around older households with larger outdoor areas, greater densities of containers with standing water, less frequent yard maintenance, and greater air-conditioner use. We also found that Ae. aegypti abundance indoors was higher in households that had less window and door screening, less air-conditioner usage, more potted plants indoors, more rain-exposed containers around the home, and lower neighborhood human population densities. Our results indicate that, in the areas of southern California studied, there are behavioral and socio-demographic determinants of Ae. aegypti abundance, and that low-income households could be at higher risk for exposure to Ae. aegypti biting and potentially greater risk for Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus transmission if a local outbreak were to occur."

Adult Ae. aegypti were detected at 72% of households overall and were found indoors at 12% of households. An average of 3.1 Ae. aegypti were collected per household. Ae. aegypti abundance outdoors was higher in lower-income neighborhoods and around older households with larger outdoor areas, greater densities of containers with standing water, less frequent yard maintenance, and greater air-conditioner use. We also found that Ae. aegypti abundance indoors was higher in households that had less window and door screening, less air-conditioner usage, more potted plants indoors, more rain-exposed containers around the home, and lower neighborhood human population densities. Our results indicate that, in the areas of southern California studied, there are behavioral and socio-demographic determinants of Ae. aegypti abundance, and that low-income households could be at higher risk for exposure to Ae. aegypti biting and potentially greater risk for Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus transmission if a local outbreak were to occur."

          "abstract": "The spread of Aedes aegypti in California and other regions of the U.S. has increased the need to understand the potential for local chains of Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission, particularly in arid regions where the ecology of these mosquitoes is less understood. For public health and vector control programs, it is helpful to know whether variation in risk of local transmission can be attributed to socio-demographic factors that could help to target surveillance and control programs. Socio-demographic factors have been shown to influence transmission risk of dengue virus outside the U.S. by modifying biting rates and vector abundance. In regions of the U.S. where Ae. aegypti have recently invaded and where residential areas are structured differently than those in the tropics where Ae. aegypti are endemic, it is unclear how socio-demographic factors modify the abundance of Ae. aegypti populations. Understanding heterogeneities among households in Ae. aegypti abundance will provide a better understanding of local vectorial capacity and is an important component of understanding risk of local Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Los Angeles County, California during summer 2017 to understand the causes of variation in relative abundance of Ae. aegypti among households. We surveyed 161 houses, representing a wide range of incomes. Surveys consisted of systematic adult mosquito collections, inspections of households and properties, and administration of a questionnaire in English or Spanish. Adult Ae. aegypti were detected at 72% of households overall and were found indoors at 12% of households. An average of 3.1 Ae. aegypti were collected per household.

          "abstract": "There is an extensive literature establishing, validating, and quantifying a wide range of responses of fishes to fasting. Our study complements this work by comparing fed and unfed treatments of hatchery-raised Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus)-an imperiled fish that is endemic to the San Francisco Estuary and its tributaries in California, USA-across a diverse suite of endpoints over a two-month time series. The experiment was conducted at 15.9\u00c2\u00b0C, and individuals were sampled at 12 time points as starvation became increasingly severe. We found that hepatosomatic index and condition factor were relatively sensitive to starvation, becoming significantly depressed at Day 4 and 7, respectively. Histological analysis of liver showed elevated cytoplasmic inclusion bodies at Day 7, followed by increased glycogen depletion, single cell necrosis, and hydropic vacuolar degeneration at Day 14, 21, and 28, respectively. Of four antioxidants measured, glutathione decreased at Day 4, superoxide dismutase increased at Day 14, catalase increased at Day 56, and glutathione peroxidase was not affected by starvation. The net result was a ~2-fold increase in lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) in fasted fish that was highly inconsistent through time. RNA to DNA ratio and triglycerides in muscle were relatively insensitive to starvation, only consistently decreasing with fasting after mortality began increasing in the 'No Feeding' treatment, at Day 21. Together, these results suggest that Delta Smelt mobilize hepatic energy stores far more rapidly than lipids in muscle when subjected to fasting, leading to rapid atrophy of liver and the development of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies-possibly autophagosomes-in hepatocytes."

          "abstract": "Walnuts (Juglans regia L.) are a valuable dietary source of polyphenols and lipids, with increasing worldwide consumption. California is a major producer, with 'Chandler' and 'Tulare' among the cultivars more widely grown. 'Chandler' produces kernels with extra light color at a higher frequency than other cultivars, gaining preference by growers and consumers. Here we performed a deep comparative proteome analysis of kernel pellicle tissue from these two valued genotypes at three harvest maturities, detecting a total of 4937 J. regia proteins. Late and early maturity stages were compared for each cultivar, revealing many developmental responses common or specific for each cultivar. Top protein biomarkers for each developmental stage were also selected based on larger fold-change differences and lower variance among replicates, including proteins for biosynthesis of lipids and phenols, defense-related proteins and desiccation stress-related proteins. Comparison between the genotypes also revealed the common and specific protein repertoires, totaling 321 pellicle proteins with differential abundance at harvest stage. The proteomics data provides clues on antioxidant, secondary, and hormonal metabolism that could be involved in the loss of quality in the pellicles during processing for commercialization."

Rapid whole-genome sequencing (rWGS)-based rapid precision medicine (RPM) is an intervention that has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes and reduced costs of care. However, the feasibility of broad clinical deployment has not been established. The objective of this study was to implement RPM based on rWGS and evaluate the clinical and economic impact of this implementation as a first line diagnostic test in the California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) program. Project Baby Bear was a payor funded, prospective, real-world quality improvement project in the regional ICUs of five tertiary care children's hospitals. Participation was limited to acutely ill Medi-Cal beneficiaries who were admitted November 2018 to May 2020, were <1 year old and within one week of hospitalization, or had just developed an abnormal response to therapy. The whole cohort received RPM. There were two prespecified primary outcomes-changes in medical care reported by physicians and changes in the cost of care. The majority of infants were from underserved populations. Of 184 infants enrolled, 74 (40%) received a diagnosis by rWGS that explained their admission in a median time of 3&nbsp;days. In 58 (32%) affected individuals, rWGS led to changes in medical care. Testing and precision medicine cost $1.7 million and led to $2.2-2.9 million cost savings. rWGS-based RPM had clinical utility and reduced net health care expenditures for infants in regional ICUs. rWGS should be considered early in ICU admission when the underlying etiology is unclear."

          "abstract": "BackgroundThe application of otolith-based tools to inform the management and conservation of fishes first requires taxon- and stage-specific validation. The Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), a critically endangered estuarine fish that is endemic to the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE), California, United States, serves as a key indicator species in the SFE; thus, understanding this species' vital rates and population dynamics is valuable for assessing the overall health of the estuary. Otolith-based tools have been developed and applied across multiple life stages of Delta Smelt to reconstruct age structure, growth, phenology, and migration. However, key methodological assumptions have yet to be validated, thus limiting confidence in otolith-derived metrics that are important for informing major water management decisions in the SFE.MethodsUsing known-age cultured Delta Smelt and multiple independent otolith analysts, we examined otolith formation, otolith-somatic proportionality, aging accuracy and precision, left-right symmetry, and the effects of image magnification for larval, juvenile, and adult Delta Smelt.ResultsOverall, otolith size varied linearly with fish size (from 10-60 mm), explaining 99% of the variation in fish length, despite a unique slope for larvae < 10 mm. Otolith-somatic proportionality was similar among wild and cultured specimens. Aging precision among independent analysts was 98% and aging accuracy relative to known ages was 96%, with age estimates exhibiting negligible differences among left and right otoliths. Though error generally increased with age, percent error decreased from 0-30 days-post-hatch, with precision remaining relatively high (\u00e2\u2030\u00a5 95%) thereafter. Increased magnification (400\u00c3\u2014) further improved aging accuracy for the oldest, slowest-growing individuals. Together, these results indicate that otolith-based techniques provide reliable age and growth reconstructions for larval, juvenile, and adult Delta Smelt. Such experimental assessments across multiple developmental stages are key steps toward assessing confidence in otolith-derived metrics that are often used to assess the dynamics of wild fish populations."

We applied log-linear (Poisson) event-history regression models for clustered person-period data to adjust for sociodemographic variables and pre-procedure health status when examining associations between these contraceptive procedures and claims related to contraceptive failure, complications, and pain in the first year post-procedure.Key resultsWe identified 35,705 patients who had a levonorgestrel IUC placed, 23,628 patients who had a copper IUC placed, and 23,965 patients who underwent laparoscopic tubal ligation. In unadjusted analyses, rates of pregnancy within 1 year were similar following levonorgestrel IUC (2.40%) or copper IUC placement (2.99%) or tubal ligation (2.64%). In adjusted analyses, compared to tubal ligation, pregnancy was less common following placement of a levonorgestrel IUC (adj IRR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-0.82) and similar with placement of a copper IUC (adj IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82-1.05). Procedural complications such as infection (0.35% vs. 2.91%) were significantly less common with IUC placement than tubal ligation.

A randomized clinal trial was completed on eight California dairy herds to estimate the effects of different dry cow therapies (AB, TS, AB + TS or None) on clinical mastitis and culling. A total of 1273 cows were randomized to one of the four treatment groups over summer and winter seasons. For each enrolled cow, microbiological testing was done on quarter milk samples collected from the first detection of clinical mastitis within the first 150 days in milk (DIM) in the subsequent lactation. Statistical analysis was done using generalized linear mixed models. There were no significant differences in the odds of clinical mastitis or culling between cows treated with AB, TS, or AB + TS compared to the controls. Dry cow therapy with AB and/or TS had no statistically significant effect on clinical mastitis and cow culling during the first 150 DIM."

          "abstract": "BackgroundWe previously showed, in two separate cohorts, that high-risk infants who were later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder had abnormally high extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume from age 6-24 months. The presence of increased extra-axial CSF volume preceded the onset of behavioural symptoms of autism and was predictive of a later diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. In this study, we aimed to establish whether increased extra-axial CSF volume is found in a large, independent sample of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, whether extra-axial CSF remains abnormally increased beyond infancy, and whether it is present in both normal-risk and high-risk children with autism.MethodsIn this case-control MRI study, children with autism spectrum disorder or with typical development aged 2-4 years were recruited from the community to the UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project, based in Sacramento, CA, USA. The autism spectrum disorder group comprised children with autism spectrum disorder who were either normal risk (ie, from simplex families) or high risk (ie, from multiplex families). Measurements of extra-axial CSF volume, brain volume, head circumference, sleep problems, and familial risk status were derived from MRI and behavioural assessments. We applied a previously validated machine learning algorithm based on extra-axial CSF volume, brain volume, age, and sex to the current dataset.FindingsBetween July 20, 2007, and Dec 13, 2012, 159 children with autism spectrum disorder (132 male, 27 female) and 77 with typical development (49 male, 28 female) underwent MRI scans. The autism spectrum disorder group had an average of 15\u00c2\u00b71% more extra-axial CSF than controls after accounting for differences in brain volume, weight, age, and sex (least-squares mean 116\u00c2\u00b774 cm3 [SE 3\u00c2\u00b733] in autism group vs 101\u00c2\u00b740 cm3 [3\u00c2\u00b793] in typical development group; p=0\u00c2\u00b7007; Cohen's d = 0\u00c2\u00b739). Subgroups of normal-risk (n=132) and high-risk (n=27) children with autism spectrum disorder had nearly identical extra-axial CSF volumes (p=0\u00c2\u00b778), and both subgroups had significantly greater volumes than controls. Both extra-axial CSF volume (p=0\u00c2\u00b7004) and brain volume (p<0\u00c2\u00b70001) uniquely contributed to enlarged head circumference in the autism spectrum disorder group (p=0\u00c2\u00b704). Increased extra-axial CSF volume was associated with greater sleep disturbances (p=0\u00c2\u00b703) and lower non-verbal ability (p=0\u00c2\u00b704). The machine learning algorithm correctly predicted autism spectrum disorder diagnosis with a positive predictive value of 83% (95% CI 76\u00c2\u00b72-88\u00c2\u00b73).InterpretationIncreased extra-axial CSF volume is a reliable brain anomaly that has now been found in three independent cohorts, comprising both high-risk and normal-risk children with autism spectrum disorder. Increased extra-axial CSF volume is detectable using conventional structural MRI scans from infancy through to age 3 years. These results suggest that increased extra-axial CSF volume could be an early stratification biomarker of a biologically based subtype of autism that might share a common underlying pathophysiology.FundingUS National Institutes of Health."

          "abstract": "Vitamin D appears essential for normal neurodevelopment and cognitive and behavioral function. We examined neonatal vitamin D in relation to the child's later diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay (DD). Children aged 24-60\u00e2\u20ac\u2030months enrolled in the population-based CHARGE case-control study were evaluated clinically for ASD (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030357), DD (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030134), or typical development (TD, n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030234) at the MIND Institute (Sacramento, CA) using standardized assessments. Total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) was measured using sensitive isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in archived dried blood spots collected for the California Department of Public Health's Newborn Screening Program. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate ORs as measures of the associations between 25\u00e2\u20ac\u2030nmol/L change in 25(OH)D and ASD and DD. Associations between 25(OH)D and scores on Mullen Scales of Early Learning and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales were assessed using robust linear regression. Effect modification was examined using stratified models and interaction product terms. Unadjusted mean (SD) 25(OH)D was lower for DD (73.2 [37.6]) than for TD (82.7 [39.3]) and ASD (80.1 [37.4]). After adjustment for maternal prepregnancy body mass index and education, a 25\u00e2\u20ac\u2030nmol/L increase in total 25(OH)D was not associated with ASD (OR\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.97; CI: 0.87-1.08) or DD (OR\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.91; 95% CI: 0.78-1.06).

We examined neonatal total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) measured in dried blood spots in relation to later diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay (DD) and related assessment scores. Higher neonatal 25(OH)D was associated with a 26% reduction in the odds for ASD only in females. After taking into account factors that could contribute to vitamin D status, a significant association with 21% reduced odds for DD was found only in non-Hispanic white children. Though results were nonsignificant overall, certain subgroups might benefit from higher neonatal vitamin D."

          "abstract": "In estuary and coastal systems, human demand for freshwater, climate change-driven precipitation variability, and extreme weather impact salinity levels, reducing connectivity between mesohaline coastal fish populations and potentially contributing to genomic divergence. We examined gill transcriptome responses to salinity in wild-caught juveniles from two populations of Sacramento splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus), a species of conservation concern that is endemic to the San Francisco Estuary, USA, and the lower reaches of its tributaries. Recent extreme droughts have led to salinities above the tolerance limits for this species, creating a migration barrier between these populations, which potentially contributed to population divergence. We identified transcripts involved in a conserved response to salinity; however, the more salinity-tolerant San Pablo population had greater transcriptome plasticity (3.6-fold more transcripts responded than the Central Valley population) and a response consistent with gill remodeling after 168&nbsp;hr of exposure to elevated salinity. The reorganization of the gill in response to changing osmotic gradients is a process critical for acclimation and would facilitate enhanced salinity tolerance. We detected an upregulation of receptors that control the Wnt (wingless-type) cell signaling pathway that may be required for an adaptive response to increases in salinity, patterns not observed in the relatively salinity-sensitive Central Valley population. We detected 62 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding regions of 26 transcripts that differed between the populations. Eight transcripts that contained SNPs were associated with immune responses, highlighting the importance of diversity in immune gene sequences as a defining characteristic of genomic divergence between these populations. Our data demonstrate that these populations have divergent transcriptomic responses to salinity, which is consistent with observed physiological differences in salinity tolerance."

          "abstract": "In recent years, transportation planners have devoted more attention to the goal of increasing the non-motorized trips of children and adults. Non-motorized trips are considered important as a mean of reducing motorized trips as well increasing physical activity. Indeed, lack of physical activity has been identified as a major public health problem for both adults and younger people (Center of Disease control (CDC), 2005; Sallis, et al., 2004). A CDC report from 2002, for example, reports that about a third of the teenagers are not physically active enough (CDC, 2002). The lack of physical activity among children is, in part, associated with travel behavior and urban form (Ewing et al, 2003, Handy et al, 2002; Martin-Diener et al, 2005): children living in auto-oriented areas in the U.S. use walking and biking as modes of transportation to nearby destinations to a limited extent and less than in the past (Sallis et al, 1993; Sallis et al 2000). Their high level of auto use is, of course, tied to a high level of auto use among their parents, particularly their mothers (McMillan, 2007).For children, much discussion has focused on the journey to school, though researchers are now addressing non-school travel as well. According to McDonald (2006), who studied children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travel patterns based on the National Household Travel Survey, only 12% of the trips to sport activities are made by bike. The NHTS data do not allow a full estimate of non-motorized trips taken alone, versus trips taken with a parent, but it is reasonable to assume that use of bikes is even lower when parents are involved in the trip. Copperman and Bhat (2007) analyzed the determinants of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekend physical activity participation using data from the 2000 Bay Area travel survey. Their models correlate socio-demographic and land use variables with active and passive travel (i.e. non-motorized and motorized) and with physically active and passive activities. Their findings suggest that children (ages 5 to 17) rarely use non-motorized modes to get to places where they engage in physical activities, and that individual and household demographics, along with environmental factors, affect the level of physical activity.One place where children might be expected to use non-motorized modes to get to after-school activities is Davis, CA, well-known as a bicycle-friendly community. In Fall 2006, the Davis chapter of the American Youth Soccer Organization (Davis AYSO) set out to increase bicycling to soccer games through a two-pronged approach. First, the organization adopted a new approach to scheduling games, spreading them to fields throughout Davis rather than scheduling as many games as possible at three centralized fields. For most games, at least one team (and often both) was scheduled for a field within their neighborhood. In addition, Davis AYSO undertook a promotional program to encourage families to bike to games, including distribution of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bike to AYSO\u00e2\u20ac\u009d bike stickers, the creation of a special web site that included a Davis Bike Map, and e-mail announcements to almost all families about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bike to AYSO\u00e2\u20ac\u009d effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of this program in encouraging players and their families to bike more frequently, Davis AYSO worked with researchers at the University of California, Davis. This report describes the methods used in that effort and summarizes the results."

          "abstract": "Vitamin D appears essential for normal neurodevelopment and cognitive and behavioral function. We examined neonatal vitamin D in relation to the child's later diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay (DD). Children aged 24-60\u00e2\u20ac\u2030months enrolled in the population-based CHARGE case-control study were evaluated clinically for ASD (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030357), DD (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030134), or typical development (TD, n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030234) at the MIND Institute (Sacramento, CA) using standardized assessments. Total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) was measured using sensitive isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in archived dried blood spots collected for the California Department of Public Health's Newborn Screening Program. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate ORs as measures of the associations between 25\u00e2\u20ac\u2030nmol/L change in 25(OH)D and ASD and DD. Associations between 25(OH)D and scores on Mullen Scales of Early Learning and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales were assessed using robust linear regression. Effect modification was examined using stratified models and interaction product terms. Unadjusted mean (SD) 25(OH)D was lower for DD (73.2 [37.6]) than for TD (82.7 [39.3]) and ASD (80.1 [37.4]). After adjustment for maternal prepregnancy body mass index and education, a 25\u00e2\u20ac\u2030nmol/L increase in total 25(OH)D was not associated with ASD (OR\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.97; CI: 0.87-1.08) or DD (OR\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.91; 95% CI: 0.78-1.06). Neonatal 25(OH)D was associated with significantly reduced ASD only in females (adjusted OR\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.74; 95% CI: 0.55-0.99, Pinteraction \u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.03), and significantly reduced DD only in non-Hispanic white children (adjusted OR\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.79; 95% CI: 0.63-0.98, Pinteraction \u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.11 for Hispanic, Pinteraction \u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.31 for other), driven by DD children with trisomy 21. This study provides evidence that neonatal vitamin D could be associated with ASD in females and with DD in non-Hispanic white children. Autism Res 2019, 12: 976-988. \u00c2\u00a9 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Vitamin D appears essential for brain development and function. We examined neonatal total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) measured in dried blood spots in relation to later diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay (DD) and related assessment scores. Higher neonatal 25(OH)D was associated with a 26% reduction in the odds for ASD only in females. After taking into account factors that could contribute to vitamin D status, a significant association with 21% reduced odds for DD was found only in non-Hispanic white children. Though results were nonsignificant overall, certain subgroups might benefit from higher neonatal vitamin D."

          "abstract": "ObjectiveHispanic/Latino individuals in the U.S. have the highest prevalence of undiagnosed and untreated diabetes and are at increased risk for cognitive impairment. In this study, we examine glycemic control in relation to cognitive aging and impairment in a large prospective cohort of middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals of diverse heritages.Research design and methodsStudy of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) is a Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) ancillary study. HCHS/SOL is a multisite (Bronx, NY; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; and San Diego, CA), probability sampled prospective cohort study. SOL-INCA enrolled 6,377 diverse Hispanic/Latino individuals aged 50 years and older (2016-2018). The primary outcomes were cognitive function, 7-year cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The primary glycemia exposure variables were measured from fasting blood samples collected at HCHS/SOL visit 1 (2008-2011).ResultsVisit 1 mean age was 56.5 years \u00c2\u00b1 8.2 SD, and the average glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) was 6.12% (43.5 \u00c2\u00b1 14.6 mmol/mol). After covariate adjustment, higher HbA1c was associated with accelerated 7-year global (b = -0.045; 95% CI -0.070; -0.021; in z score units) and executive cognitive decline and a higher prevalence of MCI (odds ratio 1.20; 95% CI 1.11; 1.29).ConclusionsElevated HbA1c levels were associated with 7-year executive cognitive decline and increased MCI risk among diverse middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals. Our findings indicate that poor glycemic control in midlife may pose significant risks for cognitive decline and MCI later in life among Hispanic/Latino individuals of diverse heritages."

          "abstract": "The straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is a pteropodid whose conservation is crucial for maintaining functional connectivity of plant populations in tropical Africa. Land conversion has pushed this species to adapt to roosting in urban centers across its range. These colonies often host millions of individuals, creating intensive human-bat contact interfaces that could facilitate the spillover of coronaviruses shed by these bats. A better understanding of coronavirus dynamics in these roosts is needed to identify peak times of exposure risk in order to propose evidence-based management that supports safe human-bat coexistence, as well as the conservation of this chiropteran. We studied the temporal patterns of coronavirus shedding in E. helvum, by testing thousands of longitudinally-collected fecal samples from two spatially distant urban roosts in Ghana and Tanzania. Shedding of coronaviruses peaked during the second part of pup weaning in both roosts. Assuming that coronavirus shedding is directly related to spillover risk, our results indicate that exposure mitigation should target reducing contact between people and E. helvum roosts during the pup \"weaning\" period. This recommendation can be applied across the many highly-populated urban sites occupied by E. helvum across Africa."

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Information on salt consumption patterns is needed to inform the need for and design of salt reduction strategies. OBJECTIVES: In northern Ghana, this study aimed to estimate household consumption of salt, including salt from bouillon, and compare (estimated) women and childrens salt intake to global recommendations; to estimate the proportion of salt consumed from bouillon; and to identify factors, including knowledge, attitudes, and practices, associated with household salt consumption. METHODS: Employing mixed-methods methodology, we conducted a pilot survey (n = 369 households enrolled) and focus group discussions (FGDs; n = 20) in Tolon and Kumbungu districts (14 urban, 14 rural clusters) (clinicaltrials.gov registry: NCT04632771). Households reported purchases of discretionary salt (DS, table salt) and bouillon cubes. DS and total salt (TS; DS+salt from bouillon) consumption for women (15-49 y) and children (2-5 y) were estimated using the Adult Male Equivalent method and compared with global recommendations (<5 g/d women; <3.75 g/d children). Womens salt intake was also predicted from urinary sodium excretion (INTERSALT equation). Associations between DS and TS consumption, as well as household and womens characteristics, were tested with minimally adjusted and multivariable linear mixed-effects models. Qualitative FGD themes were generated using the Framework Method. RESULTS: From household purchase data, estimated TS consumption exceeded global recommendations for 44% of children [median: 2.9 (IQR: 1.9, 5.2) g/d] and 60% of women [6.0 (4.0, 10.2) g/d]; 35% of children and 50% of women exceeded recommendations from DS alone. Bouillon contributed <25% of households TS consumption. Few characteristics were associated with DS or TS consumption. Salient qualitative themes that shaped salt consumption behaviors included salts ubiquity as a seasoning, key household members influence on food procurement and preparation, and perceptions about health. CONCLUSIONS: Purchase data suggest salt consumption among women and children exceeds recommendations, even when excluding salt from bouillon; food prepared outside the home likely further contributes. Salt reduction interventions may be warranted in this context."

          "abstract": "This study aimed to characterise three Ghanaian local chicken ecotypes, namely, Interior Savannah, Forest, and Coastal Savannah, based on morphological data and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes. Morphological data including body weight, shank length, body girth, back length, thigh length, beak length, comb length, and wattle length were collected from 250 local chickens. DNA isolated from blood of 1,440 local chickens was used for SNP genotyping with the Affymetrix chicken 600k SNP chip. Principal component analysis showed that Forest and Coastal Savannah birds were closely related. Generally, all three ecotypes exhibited high genetic diversity, especially birds from the Interior Savannah zone. Morphological characterisation showed that ecotype (p = 0.016) and sex (p = 0.000) had significant effects on body weight. Birds of the Interior Savannah ecotype were the heaviest (p = 0.004), with mean weights of 1.23 kg for females and 1.40 kg for males. Sex also had a strong significant effect on most of the morphological measurements, but the sex * ecotype interaction effect was not significant. Very few of the feather phenotypes previously reported to be associated with heat resistance-frizzle (2%) and naked neck (1.6%)-were found in the studied populations. It is concluded that the three local ecotypes are genetically diverse but with similar morphological features and the information provided would be useful for future selection decisions."

Indeed, the potential for energy saving and greenhouse gas reduction in transportation is huge. The many strategies for doing so may be clustered into three groups:\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2reduce vehicle travel;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2improve conventional vehicle technology; and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2introduce advanced technologies and low-carbon fuels.All three are important. The first, reductions in vehicle travel, are desirable for a variety of reasons, and certainly merit strong support. But in terms of GHG reductions, technology-based strategies (the 2nd and 3rd strategies) are likely to be far more effective, especially in the US and probably in all OECD countries. Very large reductions are possible with improvements in conventional vehicle technology, and even greater reductions are possible with emerging electric-drive technologies and low-carbon fuels."

          "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is suspected to have environmental and genetic contributions. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental risk factors of interest due to their potential as neurodevelopmental toxicants and environmental persistence despite a US production ban in the 1970s.MethodsParticipants were mother-child pairs from MARBLES, a high-risk pregnancy cohort that enrolls families who have one child diagnosed with ASD and are planning to have another child. PCB concentrations were measured in maternal blood at each trimester of pregnancy using gas chromatography coupled with triple quadruple mass spectrometry. Concentrations were summed into total PCB and two categories based on function/mechanisms of action: dioxin-like (DL), and ryanodine receptor (RyR)-activating PCBs. Multinomial logistic regression assessed risk of clinical outcome classification of ASD and non-typical development (Non-TD) compared to typically developing (TD) in the children at 3 years old.ResultsA total of 104 mother-child pairs were included. There were no significant associations for total PCB; however, there were borderline significant associations between DL-PCBs and decreased risk for Non-TD outcome classification (adjusted OR: 0.41 (95% CI 0.15-1.14)) and between RyR-activating PCBs and increased risk for ASD outcome classification (adjusted OR: 2.63 (95% CI 0.87-7.97)).ConclusionThis study does not provide strong supporting evidence that PCBs are risk factors for ASD or Non-TD. However, these analyses suggest the need to explore more deeply into subsets of PCBs as risk factors based on their function and structure in larger cohort studies where non-monotonic dose-response patterns can be better evaluated."

          "abstract": "Multi-scale computational modeling is a major branch of computational biology as evidenced by the US federal interagency Multi-Scale Modeling Consortium and major international projects. It invariably involves specific and detailed sequences of data analysis and simulation, often with multiple tools and datasets, and the community recognizes improved modularity, reuse, reproducibility, portability and scalability as critical unmet needs in this area. Scientific workflows are a well-recognized strategy for addressing these needs in scientific computing. While there are good examples if the use of scientific workflows in bioinformatics, medical informatics, biomedical imaging and data analysis, there are fewer examples in multi-scale computational modeling in general and cardiac electrophysiology in particular. Cardiac electrophysiology simulation is a mature area of multi-scale computational biology that serves as an excellent use case for developing and testing new scientific workflows. In this article, we develop, describe and test a computational workflow that serves as a proof of concept of a platform for the robust integration and implementation of a reusable and reproducible multi-scale cardiac cell and tissue model that is expandable, modular and portable. The workflow described leverages Python and Kepler-Python actor for plotting and pre/post-processing. During all stages of the workflow design, we rely on freely available open-source tools, to make our workflow freely usable by scientists."

          "abstract": "Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy in U.S. Latinas and in Colombian women. Studies in non-Latinos indicate that BRAF and TERT mutations are PTC prognostic markers. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of BRAF and TERT mutations in PTC Latino patients from Colombia. We analyzed mutations of BRAF (V600E) and TERT promoter (C228T, C250T) in tumor DNA from 141 patients (75 with classical variant PTC, CVPTC; 66 with follicular variant PTC, FVPTC) recruited through a multi-center study. Associations between mutations and clinical variables were evaluated with Fisher exact tests. Survival was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier plots. Double-mutant tumors (BRAF+/TERT+, n = 14 patients) were more common in CVPTC (P = 0.02). Relative to patients without mutations (n = 48), double mutations were more common in patients with large tumors (P = 0.03), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.01), extra-thyroid extension (P = 0.03), and advanced stage (P = 6.0 \u00c3\u2014 10-5). In older patients, TERT mutations were more frequent (mean age 51 years vs 45 years for wild type TERT, P = 0.04) and survival was lower (HR = 1.20; P = 0.017); however, given the small sample size, the decrease in survival was not statically significant between genotypes. Comparisons with published data in US whites revealed that Colombian patients had a higher prevalence of severe pathological features and of double-mutant tumors (10 vs 6%, P = 0.001). Mutations in both oncogenes show prognostic associations in Latinos from Colombia. Our study is important to advance Latino PTC precision medicine and replicates previous prognostic associations between BRAF and TERT in this population."

The influence of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) on the distribution of radiologist recall rates is uncertain.ObjectiveTo evaluate radiologists' recall and cancer detection rates before and after beginning interpretation of DBT examinations.Design, setting, and participantsThis cohort study included 198 radiologists from 104 radiology facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium who interpreted 251\u00e2\u20ac\u00af384 DBT and 2\u00e2\u20ac\u00af000\u00e2\u20ac\u00af681 digital mammography (DM) screening examinations from 2009 to 2017, including 126 radiologists (63.6%) who interpreted DBT examinations during the study period and 72 (36.4%) who exclusively interpreted DM examinations (to adjust for secular trends). Data were analyzed from April 2018 to July 2019.ExposuresDigital breast tomosynthesis and DM screening examinations.Main outcomes and measuresRecall rate and cancer detection rate.ResultsA total of 198 radiologists interpreted 2\u00e2\u20ac\u00af252\u00e2\u20ac\u00af065 DM and DBT examinations (2\u00e2\u20ac\u00af000\u00e2\u20ac\u00af681 [88.8%] DM examinations; 251\u00e2\u20ac\u00af384 [11.2%] DBT examinations; 710\u00e2\u20ac\u00af934 patients [31.6%] aged 50-59 years; 1\u00e2\u20ac\u00af448\u00e2\u20ac\u00af981 [64.3%] non-Hispanic white). Among the 126 radiologists (63.6%) who interpreted DBT examinations, 83 (65.9%) had unadjusted DM recall rates of no more than 12% before using DBT, with a median (interquartile range) recall rate of 10.0% (7.5%-13.0%). On DBT examinations, 96 (76.2%) had an unadjusted recall rate of no more than 12%, with a median (interquartile range) recall rate of 8.8% (6.3%-11.3%). A secular trend in recall rate was observed, with the multivariable-adjusted risk of recall on screening examinations declining by 1.2% (95% CI, 0.9%-1.5%) per year. After adjusting for examination characteristics and secular trends, recall rates were 15% lower on DBT examinations compared with DM examinations interpreted before DBT use (relative risk, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.83-0.87). Adjusted recall rates were significantly lower on DBT examinations compared with DM examinations interpreted before DBT use for 45 radiologists (35.7%) and significantly higher for 18 (14.3%); 63 (50.0%) had no statistically significant change. The unadjusted cancer detection rate on DBT was 5.3 per 1000 examinations (95% CI, 5.0-5.7 per 1000 examinations) compared with 4.7 per 1000 examinations (95% CI, 4.6-4.8 per 1000 examinations) on DM examinations interpreted before DM use (multivariable-adjusted risk ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.33).Conclusions and relevanceIn this study, DBT was associated with an overall decrease in recall rate and an increase in cancer detection rate. However, our results indicated that there is wide variability among radiologists, including a subset of radiologists who experienced increased recall rates on DBT examinations. Radiology practices should audit radiologist DBT screening performance and consider additional DBT training for radiologists whose performance does not improve as expected."

          "abstract": "US nursing homes are required to have sufficient nursing staff with the appropriate competencies to assure resident safety and attain or maintain the highest practicable level of physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident. Minimum nurse staffing levels have been identified in research studies and recommended by experts. Beyond the minimum levels, nursing homes must take into account the resident acuity to assure they have adequate staffing levels to meet the needs of residents. This paper presents a guide for determining whether a nursing home has adequate and appropriate nurse staffing. We propose five basic steps to: (1) determine the collective resident acuity and care needs, (2) determine the actual nurse staffing levels, (3) identify appropriate nurse staffing levels to meet residents care needs, (4) examine evidence regarding the adequacy of staffing, and (5) identify gaps between the actual staffing and the appropriate nursing staffing levels based on resident acuity. Data sources and specific methodologies are analyzed, compared, and recommended. The goal is to assist nursing home nurses and administrators to ensure adequate nursing home staffing levels that protect resident health, safety, and well-being."

          "abstract": "Although incidence of clinical hypocalcemia in postpartum dairy cows is low in US dairies, subclinical hypocalcemia after calving is common and has been associated with metabolic and infectious disease. It is widespread farm practice to feed a diet rich in anions to prepartum dairy cattle to support calcium homeostasis. However, this diet is typically discontinued at parturition, when calcium needs are still high. The objective of this trial was to determine the effects of extending metabolic acidification into the first 3 d of lactation in multiparous Holstein cows with the use of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) hexahydrate drenches on blood ionized calcium concentrations. Adult Holstein cows at a commercial dairy in their second or higher lactation, with a urine pH of 6.8 or less on the day of calving, were randomly assigned to either treatment or control groups, resulting in 13 cows in the treatment group and 14 cows in the control group. Treatment cows received 480 g of oral MgCl2 hexahydrate once daily for 3 d for continued acidification starting on the day of calving, whereas cows in the control group received no treatment. Urine pH was measured daily for 5 d, starting on the day of calving (0 DIM), to assess acidification status; blood was collected on day of calving (0 DIM), 2 DIM, and 4 DIM and analyzed for ionized calcium concentrations. Differences in blood ionized calcium and urine pH over time were compared using longitudinal data analysis. Urine pH was lower in treatment cows compared with control cows at 1, 2, and 3 DIM. Blood ionized calcium concentrations were different from baseline, taken at enrollment (0 DIM) and at 2 and 4 DIM in both treatment and control cows. However, no difference was detectable between treatment and control cows at 2 or 4 DIM with respect to blood ionized calcium concentrations. Oral supplementation with MgCl2 hexahydrate resulted in the desired acidification of urine pH in the treatment group, similar to feeding of an anionic close-up diet. Continued acidification of dairy cows until 2 DIM did not result in clinically meaningful higher blood calcium concentrations compared with controls, and further research is needed, to identify physiological reasons for this finding."

          "abstract": "PurposeOsteoarthritis (OA) is a frequently occurring, chronic condition; however, few studies describe the clinical characteristics of individuals with OA and the treatments they use to manage their symptoms. We conducted a study to characterize the OA population in the US and describe the nonsurgical management used by this population based on consumer research data collected through an online survey.MethodsData from the 2017 US National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) for adults aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a535 years were used to evaluate the relationship between OA and certain study participant characteristics and to identify the most commonly used treatment options. NHWS data were collected through a survey of individuals drawn from the internet panel maintained by Lightspeed Research (Bridgewater, New Jersey) and its panel partners. Weighted estimates were generated using data from the 2016 Current Population Survey (Annual Demographics File) of the US Census Bureau. Comparisons between the general and OA populations were made based on body mass index (BMI), exercise frequency, and comorbid diagnoses of hypertension or diabetes. Among the OA population, the use of dietary supplements, prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) treatments with chondroitin with or without glucosamine (Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl), prescription treatment by time since OA diagnosis, and utilization of a physical therapist were also recorded.ResultsThe prevalence of OA in the overall population was 17.6 % and was higher for individuals with a BMI \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 25 (21.9 %), patients diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes (36.2 %), and those who did not exercise regularly (19.0 %). Adults without OA were more likely to exercise regularly (12 days per month or more) than adults diagnosed with OA. Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl (6.0 %) was the most commonly used OTC dietary supplement in the OA population, followed by omega-3 fatty acids (2.8 %), vitamin D (1.9 %), calcium (1.1 %), and multivitamins (0.7 %). Individuals using Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl were more likely to use OTC only products (75.4 % vs 37.3 %) or prescription medications, namely non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or opioids, and OTC products (24.6 % vs 13.0 %) compared with individuals not using Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl, while individuals not using Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl were more likely to be untreated (30.3 % vs 0) or to use prescription medications only (19.4 % vs 0). Nearly 32 % of individuals with OA reported using prescription treatments, and the likelihood of using a prescription treatment increased with number of years since OA diagnosis (<3 years: 27.5 %; \u00e2\u2030\u00a521 years: 32.5 %). The pharmaceutical products used by this population primarily consisted of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and opioids. Approximately 13 % of patients with OA had visited a physical therapist in the past 6 months.ConclusionsThe prevalence of OA was higher in those with a high BMI, and comorbid diabetes or hypertension. Individuals with OA using Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl primarily reported use of OTC products only or used them in combination with prescription products. The likelihood of using prescription products increased with the length of OA history. These data provide valuable new information about demographics, clinical characteristics, and commonly used prescription and OTC treatments and dietary supplements in the OA population."

None of the 3 grading systems yielded a statistically significant correlation between US risk category and the ROM (P = .30, .72, .28).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The ATA, Korean-TIRADS, and ACR-TIRADS classification systems are not helpful in stratifying ROM in patients with Bethesda category IV nodules. Clinicians should be cautious of using ultra-sound alone when deciding between therapeutic options for patients with Bethesda category IV thyroid nodules."

          "title": "Cohousing by Any Other Name: A Framing Study Exploring Ideological Barriers to Adoption of Collectivist Housing Options",
          "abstract": "Recent research suggests there is broader interest in cohousing in the US than its current niche market suggests. However, the lack of ideological diversity among cohousing adopters does not seem malleable. Cohousing adopters are predominately liberal and liberal ideology strongly predicts interest in cohousing. This research explored perceptions (including misperceptions) of cohousing and tested whether framing the concept differently could make it more appealing to Republicans and conservatives. Survey participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two versions of a survey, identical in all ways except in one version the term pocket neighborhoods was substituted for cohousing. Results revealed substantial misunderstanding of the concept of cohousing, particularly that it involves multiple unrelated households living under the same roof. There was no framing effect; those who identified as Republican or conservative did not find cohousing more appealing when it was called pocket neighborhoods. The most cited perceived benefits of cohousing were social interaction, relationships, and support, while lack of privacy and personal space topped the list of drawbacks. Understanding these common perceptions about cohousing can help stakeholders communicate more effectively about this model that promises many benefits to an apparently untapped prospective market."

          "abstract": "The US Gulf Coast is often struck by severe hurricane events. These natural events can cause massive economic and life losses. Based on the projected increase in global sea surface temperature and in population residing along the US Gulf Coast region, the intensity of future hurricanes is expected to increase with time in conjunction with an increase in vulnerability, leading to a significant increase of the risk for future catastrophic hurricane events. Therefore, there is an urgent research need for hurricane risk assessment and mitigation techniques that can quantify the effects of climate change. This paper presents a comprehensive statistical model to account for the effects of climate change on hurricane wind hazard. The model is based on a linear regression of historical hurricane characteristics versus historical sea surface temperature at the time and location of the hurricanes. The proposed model is validated by comparing the simulated hurricane wind speed distributions at any given site along the US Gulf Coast with the wind speed data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The validated wind speed model is used, in conjunction with the future climatological scenarios proposed by the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to forecast future hurricane wind speed distributions along the US Gulf Coast. These wind speed distributions are used within a multilayer Monte Carlo simulation implementation of the Performance-Based Hurricane Engineering framework to estimate potential hurricane-induced losses for a single-family residential building located near Miami, FL. The loss analysis results show that the expected hurricane-induced losses could increase by up to 35% under the projected worst-case scenario in 2060 when compared to the expected losses corresponding to the 2015 climatological conditions."

A two-part multilevel model is a special case of a multilevel model developed for semi-continuous data, such as data that include a combination of zeros and continuous values. For repeated measures of media use data, a two-part multilevel model informs market research about consumer-specific likeliness to use media, level of use across time, and variation in use over time. These models are typically estimated using maximum likelihood. There are, however, tremendous advantages to using a Bayesian framework, including the ease at which the analyst can take into account information learned from previous investigations. This paper develops a Bayesian approach to estimating a two-part multilevel model and illustrates its use by applying the model to daily diary measures of television use in a large US sample."

A multicenter randomized clinical trial compared 2 strategies for medical management and found that mifepristone pretreatment is 25% more effective than the standard of care, misoprostol alone.

Participants included 300 women with anembryonic gestation or embryonic or fetal demise. Cost-effectiveness was computed from the health care sector and societal perspectives, with a 30-day time horizon.

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of mifepristone and misoprostol vs misoprostol alone were calculated, and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated.ResultsAmong the 300 women included in the randomized clinical trial (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [6.2] years), mean costs were similar for groups receiving mifepristone pretreatment and misoprostol alone from the health care sector perspective ($696.75 [95% CI, $591.88-$801.62] vs $690.88 [95% CI, $562.38-$819.38]; P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.94) and the societal perspective ($3846.30 [95% CI, $2783.01-$4909.58] vs $4845.62 [95% CI, $3186.84-$6504.41]; P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.32).

No associations were found with objective school lunch healthfulness.Conclusions and implicationsStudent perception of healthfulness of school lunch is positively associated with participation but not with objective school lunch healthfulness. Understanding how student perception is associated with participation can inform effective communications to students to increase participation in the school lunch program."

The purpose of this report is to examine trends of gabapentinoid use among US adults with cancer from 2005 to 2015. METHODS: We conducted a serial, cross-sectional study using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). We performed multiple logistic regression to examine the annual percentages of gabapentinoid users, which were adjusted for age, sex, and US region of residence. The amount of gabapentinoid prescriptions filled in 2015 was also estimated. RESULTS: The adjusted percentage of gabapentinoid users in 2015 was 5.60% (3.79%, 7.41%), 2.39 times greater than the percentage in 2005 (p < .001). By 2015, the number of gabapentinoid prescriptions had grown to approximately 3.52 million (2.40 million, 4.65 million). CONCLUSION: We observed greater than a twofold increase in the trend of gabapentinoid medication use among US adults with cancer. Investigations on the long-term efficacy of gabapentinoids for complex pain syndromes, and mitigation of risks, is essential to guide informed clinical management and keep patients safe."

Hamsters are a well-published animal model for PPE infection studies in pigs. There is no laboratory animal model for EPE infection studies and it is not known whether there is species-specificity for equine or porcine isolates of L. intracellularis in animal models. The objective of this study was to determine whether it is possible to generate typical EPE lesions in hamsters after inoculation with an equine strain of L. intracellularis (EPE strain) and whether it is comparatively possible to generate PPE lesions in rabbits after inoculation with a porcine strain of L. intracellularis (PPE strain). In 2 separate trials, 4-week-old and 3-week-old weanling golden Syrian hamsters were challenged with EPE strains and compared to uninfected (both trials) and PPE-infected controls (Trial 2 only). Concurrently, 6 female New Zealand white juvenile rabbits were infected with PPE strain and observed concomitantly to 8 similar rabbits infected with EPE strain for a different experiment. Hamsters and rabbits were observed for 21 to 24 days post-infection (DPI), depending on the experiment. Neither infected species developed clinical signs. The presence of disease was assessed with diagnostic techniques classically used for pigs and horses: immune-peroxidase monolayer assay on sera; quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection of molecular DNA in feces; and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on intestinal tissues. Our results showed that EPE-challenged hamsters do not develop infection when compared with PPE controls (IHC, P = 0.009; qPCR, P = 0.0003). Conversely, PPE-challenged rabbits do not develop typical intestinal lesions in comparison to EPE-challenged rabbits, with serological response at 14 DPI being significantly lower (P = 0.0023). In conclusion, PPE and EPE strains appear to have different host-specificities for hamsters and rabbits, respectively."

          "abstract": "Domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are increasingly popular as household pets; therefore, veterinarians need to be familiar with the most common diseases afflicting rabbits including dental diseases. Diagnostic approaches for dental disease include gross oral examination, endoscopic oral examination, skull radiography, and computed tomography (CT). CT overcomes many limitations of standard radiography by permitting cross-sectional images of the rabbit head in multiple planes without superimposition of anatomic structures. Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is an oral and maxillofacial imaging modality that produces high-resolution images. The objective of this study was to describe and compare the normal anatomic features of the dentition and surrounding maxillofacial structures in healthy rabbits on CBCT and conventional CT. Ten New Zealand white rabbit cadaver heads were scanned using CBCT and conventional CT. Images were evaluated using Anatomage Invivo 5 software. The maxillofacial anatomy was labeled on CBCT images, and the mean lengths and widths of the teeth were determined. The visibility of relevant dental and anatomic features (pulp cavity, germinal center, tooth outline, periodontal ligament) were scored and compared between conventional CT and CBCT. The thinnest teeth were the maxillary second incisor teeth at 1.29\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.26\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mm and the maxillary third molar teeth at 1.04\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.10\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mm. In general, it was found that CBCT was superior to conventional CT when imaging the dentition. Importantly, the periodontal ligament was significantly (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.01) more visible on CBCT than on conventional CT. Ability to see the periodontal ligament with such detail may allow earlier detection and treatment of periodontal disease in rabbits. This study is the first of its kind and shows the feasibility and yield of CBCT when evaluating the maxillofacial features and dentition in rabbits."

          "abstract": "Background &amp; aim: A potential benefit of conservation agriculture (CA) is soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual, yet recent studies indicate limited or no impact of CA on total SOC in tropical agroecosystems. We evaluated biochemical indicators of soil C cycling after 9&nbsp;years (18 seasons) of contrasting tillage with and without maize residue retention in western Kenya. Methods: Potential activities of C-cycling enzymes (\u00ce\u00b2-glucosidase, GLU; \u00ce\u00b2-galactosidase, GAL; glucosaminidase, GLM; cellobiohydrolase, CEL), permanganate-oxidizable C (POXC), and soil organic matter (SOM) composition (by infrared spectroscopy) were measured. Results: POXC tended to be greater under reduced tillage and residue retention, but did not significantly differ among treatments (\u00e2\u2030\u00a4 2% of SOC). Despite no significant differences in SOC concentrations or stocks, activities of all 4 C-cycling enzymes responded strongly to tillage, and to a lesser extent to residue management. Activities of GLU, GAL, and GLM were greatest under the combination of reduced tillage and residue retention relative to other treatments. Reduced tillage produced an enrichment in carboxyl C&nbsp;=&nbsp;O (+6%) and decreased polysaccharide C-O (\u00e2\u02c6\u20193.5%) relative to conventional tillage irrespective of residue management. Conclusions: Though enzyme activities and POXC are typically associated with SOC accrual, changes in soil C cycling at this site have not translated into significant differences in SOC after 9&nbsp;years. Elevated enzyme activities may have offset potential SOC accumulation under CA. However, the ratio of C-cycling enzyme activities to SOC was higher under reduced tillage and residue retention relative to other treatments, indicating that stoichiometric scaling of SOC and enzyme activities does not explain absence of significant differences in SOC among tillage and residue managements. Potential factors that may explain the low SOC accrual rates in this tropical agroecosystem included the low, albeit realistic, levels of residue retention, nutrient limitations, and high temperatures favoring decomposition."

          "abstract": "Infrared spectroscopy has transformed soil property quantification by enabling low-cost, high-throughput analysis of soils, enabling mapping and monitoring of this non-renewable resource. However, less evaluated are newly emerging indicators of soil health. Furthermore, as soil spectral libraries expand in size, commonly employed linear models such as partial least squares regression (PLSR) may be challenged by the number and diversity of spectra. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are an emerging deep learning approach that can offer advantages in quantification of soil properties by utilizing non-linear relationships among spectra and soil components. We compared ANN versus PLSR models for predicting an increasingly used soil health indicator, permanganate oxidizable C (POXC), as well as more routinely predicted soil variables (e.g., clay, soil organic C [SOC]), across a gradient of soil organic matter furnished by a deforestation chronosequence in Kenya (n = 144). Candidate ANN architectures were first methodologically evaluated and described to identify best-practices for the application of ANN to soil spectroscopy. Predictions by the resulting ANN relative to PLSR were similar or slightly improved for routinely measured variables that represent soil organic matter (SOC, C:N) and physical properties (clay, silt, sand, bulk density). The accuracy of POXC predictions were similar for ANN (RMSE 102 mg kg\u00e2\u02c6\u20191) and PLSR (RMSE 106 mg kg\u00e2\u02c6\u20191). However, models drew on shared but also distinct wavenumbers, indicating differential use of information in soil infrared spectra by non-linear versus linear chemometric models. Even in relatively small spectral datasets of similar soil types expected to favor PLSR, ANN shows comparable predictive performance. To help guide future applications of ANN in soil spectroscopy, we propose a systematic procedure to select ANN model hyperparameters."

This will be accomplished through a pipeline of earthquake, ionosphere, and tsunami simulations. The focus of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of our tsunami simulator for use in this simulation pipeline. The simulator we have developed is called Tsunami Squares, a computationally inexpensive program that employs a unique method of propagating water according to shallow water theory. Unlike other wave simulators, Tsunami Squares can easily propagate waves from sea to land, allowing flooded areas along the coast to be mapped. To validate its accuracy, a comparison is made to the Regional Ocean Modeling System tsunami simulator, which solves the Navier Stokes equations directly using a finite-difference method. The two simulation techniques show good agreement when compared over the 2011 Japan event and the 2010 Chile event. In addition, examples of inundation plots are displayed here to demonstrate its capability for such a warning system."

Methods: Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program between 1988 and 2009 and analyzed using Chi-squared tests, Kaplan-Meier methods, and Cox regression analysis. Results: Of the 52,260 women, 3932 (7.5%) were coded as Asian, and 48,328 (92.5%) were White. The median age of Asians at diagnosis was 56 vs. 64 years for the Whites (p < 0.001). Asians were more likely to undergo primary surgery, have an earlier stage of disease, have a diagnosis of a non-serous histology, and have lower grade tumors. The 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) of Asians was higher compared to Whites (59.1% vs. 47.3%, p < 0.001). On a subset analysis, Vietnamese, Filipino, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Asian Indian/Pakistani ethnicities had 5-year DSS of 62.1%, 61.5%, 61.0%, 59.0%, 54.6%, and 48.2%, respectively (p = 0.015). On multivariate analysis, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, race, surgery, stage, and tumor grade were all independent prognostic factors for survival. Asians were further stratified to U.S. born versus those who were born in Asia and immigrated. Asian immigrants presented at a younger age compared to U.S. born Asians. Immigrants were found to have an improved 5-year DSS when compared to U.S. born Asians and Whites of 55%, 52%, and 48%, respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Asians were more likely to be younger, undergo primary surgery, have an earlier stage of disease, non-serous histology, lower grade tumors, and higher survival."

          "abstract": "IntroductionAsian Americans are the fastest growing immigrant group in the United States and are more likely to be light and intermittent smokers (LITS) compared with non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). LITS experience adverse health effects related to smoking. Previous research has aggregated Asian American ethnic groups, masking important differences between groups. We sought to compare LITS rates among Asian American subgroups before and after the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) with NHWs in California utilizing data from the California Tobacco Surveys (CTS).MethodsWe combined 1990, 1992, and 1996 CTS (pre-MSA) and the 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008 CTS (post-MSA) to examine changes in LITS (<10 cigarettes/day or not smoking daily). Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, and Korean ethnic groups were compared with NHWs.ResultsPre-MSA logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, education level, language spoken at home, and use of other tobacco products found that Chinese (odds ratio [OR] = 3.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.19, 5.21), Filipinos (OR = 3.55, 95% CI = 2.73, 4.63), Japanese (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.22, 3.27), and Koreans (OR = 3.22, 95% CI = 2.06, 5.03) were significantly more likely to be LITS compared with NHWs. Post-MSA, all Asian American subgroups experienced an increase in LITS (11.7%-37.8%); however, only Chinese (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.16, 4.13) and Filipinos (OR = 3.33, 95% CI = 2.26, 4.91) remained significantly more likely to be LITS compared with NHWs.ConclusionsOur results highlight the need for tobacco control efforts that address the growing group of LITS among Asian Americans and NHWs."

The domestic dog has been suggested as a model to investigate normal variation in attention, hyperactivity, and impulsive behaviours impaired in Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). The human ADHD Rating Scale, modified for dogs and using owner-directed surveys, was applied in a European sample. We asked whether findings would be replicated utilizing an Internet survey in a novel sample, where unassisted survey completion, participant attitudes and breeds might affect previous findings.MethodsUsing a slightly modified version of the prior survey, we collected responses (n = 1030, 118 breeds representing 7 breed groups) primarily in the United States and Canada. This study was conducted using an Internet survey mechanism.ResultsReliability analyses confirmed two scales previously identified for dogs (inattention [IA], hyperactivity-impulsivity [HA-IM]). Models including age, training status, and breed group accounted for very little variance in subscales, with no effect of gender.ConclusionsThe factor invariance demonstrated in these findings confirms that owner report, using this modified human questionnaire, provides dog scores according to \"inattention\" and \"hyperactivity-impulsivity\" axes. Further characterization of naturally occurring variability of attention, activity, and impulsivity in domestic dogs may provide insight into genetic backgrounds underlying behaviours impaired in attention and associated disorders."

          "abstract": "Kidney cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and its incidence is increasing. The treatment of this malignancy took a major step forward with the recent introduction of targeted therapeutics, such as kinase inhibitors. Unfortunately, kinase inhibition is associated with the onset of resistance after 1 to 2 years of treatment. Regorafenib, like many multikinase inhibitors, was designed to block the activities of several key kinase pathways involved in oncogenesis (Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK) and tumor angiogenesis (VEGF-receptors), and we have recently shown that it also possesses soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitory activity, which may be contributing to its salutary effects in patients. Because sEH inhibition results in increases in the DHA-derived epoxydocosapentaenoic acids that we have previously described to possess anticancer properties, we asked whether the addition of DHA to a therapeutic regimen in the presence of regorafenib would enhance its beneficial effects in vivo We now show that the combination of regorafenib and DHA results in a synergistic effect upon tumor invasiveness as well as p-VEGFR attenuation. In addition, this combination showed a reduction in tumor weights, greater than each agent alone, in a mouse xenograft model of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC), yielding the expected oxylipin profiles; these data were supported in several RCC cell lines that showed similar results in vitro Because DHA is the predominant component of fish oil, our data suggest that this nontoxic dietary supplement could be administered with regorafenib during therapy for advanced RCC and could be the basis of a clinical trial.

It is also the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the United States. An estimated 20 million persons are currently infected with the virus, with an estimated 6 million new infections occurring annually and 12,000 new cervical cancer cases and 4,000 cervical cancer deaths annually. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is thus an especially important preventive measure for racial/ethnic groups who bear an unequal burden of cervical cancer mortality.PurposeThis study aimed to develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate intervention to educate and empower Latino and Korean Americans to make an informed HPV vaccination decision for their minor children.MethodsA parent-focused HPV vaccine education DVD was developed through focus groups and cognitive interviews with Latino and Korean Americans parents of children ages 11-17. A randomized controlled efficacy trial was subsequently conducted with 708 Latino and Korean Americans parents to assess knowledge gains, decisional conflict, decision self-efficacy and informed decision-making resulting from viewing the intervention DVD.ResultsDifferences between treatment and control groups for pre-post changes in knowledge, informed decision-making and decisional conflict were statistically significant among the parents exposed to the education intervention DVD.ConclusionThe study demonstrated that a culturally and linguistically appropriate intervention DVD designed to educate parents about the risks and benefits of the HPV vaccine promoted informed decision-making regarding HPV vaccination among at-risk populations."

Using the stochastic permanent breaks (STOPBREAK) model, I model this nonlinearity in a direct and flexible way that avoids imposing a discrete regime structure.  I apply this model to the rate of price inflation in the United States, which I show is subject to level shifts.  These shifts significantly affect the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts, causing models that assume covariance stationarity to be substantially biased.  Models that do not assume covariance stationarity, such as the random walk, are unbiased but lack precision in periods without shifts.  I show that the STOPBREAK model outperforms several alternative models in an out-of-sample inflation forecasting experiment."

Glycine tomentella Hayata (2n = 78), native to Australia, is a perennial relative in the tertiary gene pool of soybean. No effort has been devoted to using this species to increase seed yield. The objectives of this research were (i) to identify high-yielding lines derived from backcrosses between the soybean cultivar Dwight (2n = 40) and G. tomentella PI 441001 (2n = 78) and to compare their agronomic performance with that of the recurrent parent, and (ii) to determine associations between G. tomentella introgressions and agronomic traits. PI 441001 was crossed to Dwight and immature seed rescue was used to produce a sterile F1 plant. Amphidiploid plants (2n = 118) were produced by treating the F1 hybrid with colchicine. Amphidiploid plants were backcrossed to Dwight and a series of backcrosses were made to obtain lines with 2n = 40 chromosomes, which were self-fertile and genetically stable. Preliminary yield testing was used to select 180 lines in maturity groups II, III, and IV that had yields greater than or less than that of the recurrent parent. Yield data collected in two replication tests at six to eight locations in 2013 and 2014 identified experimental lines in all three maturity groups that were higher yielding than the recurrent parent. All experimental and parental lines were genotyped, revealing an average of 1% G. tomentella introgression. Significant associations were detected between G. tomentella introgressions and time of flowering, height, lodging, and yield."

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stagnant outcomes for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) 15-39 years of age with cancer are partly attributed to poor enrollment onto clinical trials. Initiatives have focused on increasing accrual, but changes at the population-level are unknown. We examined patterns of clinical trial participation over time in AYA patients with cancer. PROCEDURE: We utilized medical record data from AYAs in two population-based National Cancer Institute Patterns of Care Studies identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. Among 3135 AYAs diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and sarcoma, we used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate patient and provider characteristics associated with clinical trial enrollment. Interaction terms evaluated variation in clinical trial enrollment across patient and provider characteristics by year of diagnosis. RESULTS: From 2006 to 2012-2013, clinical trial participation increased from 14.8% to 17.9% (P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.01). Adjusting for patient and provider characteristics, we found lower clinical trial enrollment among those who were older at diagnosis, diagnosed with NHL vs ALL, treated by adult hematologist/oncologists only (vs pediatric hematologist/oncologists), and of non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic White) (P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.05 for all). Interaction analyses indicate improved clinical trial enrollment from 2006 to 2012-2013 among young adults 25-29 years of age and the uninsured. CONCLUSIONS: Although disparities in enrollment onto clinical trials remain for AYAs with cancer, our study identified increasing overall clinical trial participation over time.&nbsp;Further, we identify promising trends in enrollment uptake among AYAs 25-29 years of age and the uninsured."

          "abstract": "BackgroundObesity and overweight have increased dramatically in the United States over the last decades. The complexity of interrelated causal factors that result in obesity needs to be addressed within the cultural dynamic of sub-populations. In this study, we sought to estimate the effects of a multifaceted, community-based intervention on body mass index (BMI) among Mexican-heritage children.MethodsNi\u00c3\u00b1os Sanos, Familia Sana (Healthy Children, Healthy Family) was a quasi-experimental intervention study designed to reduce the rate of BMI growth among Mexican-heritage children in California's Central Valley. Two rural communities were matched based on demographic and environmental characteristics and were assigned as the intervention or comparison community. The three-year intervention included parent workshops on nutrition and physical activity; school-based nutrition lessons and enhanced physical education program for children; and a monthly voucher for fruits and vegetables. Eligible children were between 3 and 8\u00e2\u20ac\u2030years old at baseline. Intent-to-treat analyses were estimated using linear mixed-effect models with random intercepts. We ran a series of models for each gender where predictors were fixed except interactions between age groups and obesity status at baseline with intervention to determine the magnitude of impact on BMI.ResultsAt baseline, mean (SD) BMI z-score (zBMI) was 0.97 (0.98) in the intervention group (n&nbsp;=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030387) and 0.98 (1.02) in the comparison group (n&nbsp;=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030313) (NS). The intervention was significantly associated with log-transformed BMI (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.04 (0.02), P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.03) and zBMI (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.25 (0.12), P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.04) among boys and log-transformed BMI among obese girls (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030-\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.04 (0.02), P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.04). The intervention was significantly and inversely associated with BMI in obese boys and girls across all age groups and normal weight boys in the oldest group (over 6\u00e2\u20ac\u2030years) relative to their counterparts in the comparison community.ConclusionsA community-based, multifaceted intervention was effective at slowing the rate of BMI growth among Mexican-heritage children.

          "abstract": "Lactase persistence (LP) is a trait in which lactose can be digested throughout adulthood, while lactase non-persistence (LNP) can cause lactose intolerance and influence dairy consumption. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP ID: rs4988235) is often used as a predictor for dairy intake, since it is responsible for LP in people in European descent, and can occur in other ethnic groups. The objective of this study was to determine whether rs4988235 genotypes and ethnicity influence reported dairy consumption in the United States (U.S.). A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and multiple Automated Self-Administered 24-h recalls (ASA24\u00c2\u00ae) were used to measure habitual and recent intake, respectively, of total dairy, cheese, cow's milk, plant-based alternative milk, and yogurt in a multi-ethnic U.S. cohort genotyped for rs4988235. Within Caucasian subjects, LP individuals reported consuming more recent total dairy and habitual total cow's milk intake. For subjects of all ethnicities, LP individuals consumed more cheese (FFQ p = 0.043, ASA24 p = 0.012) and recent total dairy (ASA24 p = 0.005). For both dietary assessments, Caucasians consumed more cheese than all non-Caucasians (FFQ p = 0.036, ASA24 p = 0.002) independent of genotype, as well as more recent intake of yogurt (ASA24 p = 0.042). LP subjects consumed more total cow's milk than LNP, but only when accounting for whether subjects were Caucasian or not (FFQ p = 0.015). Fluid milk and alternative plant-based milk consumption were not associated with genotypes or ethnicity. Our results show that both LP genotype and ethnicity influence the intake of some dairy products in a multi-ethnic U.S. cohort, but the ability of rs4988235 genotypes to predict intake may depend on ethnic background, the specific dairy product, and whether intake is reported on a habitual or recent basis. Therefore, ethnicity and the dietary assessment method should also be considered when determining the suitability of rs4988235 as a proxy for dairy intake."

A major focus of past research has been on tree mortality from fire, as trees provide a vast range of biological services. We assembled a database of individual-tree records from prescribed fires and wildfires in the United States. The Fire and Tree Mortality (FTM) database includes records from 164,293 individual trees with records of fire injury (crown scorch, bole char, etc.), tree diameter, and either mortality or top-kill up to ten years post-fire. Data span 142 species and 62 genera, from 409 fires occurring from 1981-2016. Additional variables such as insect attack are included when available. The FTM database can be used to evaluate individual fire-caused mortality models for pre-fire planning and post-fire decision support, to develop improved models, and to explore general patterns of individual fire-induced tree death. The database can also be used to identify knowledge gaps that could be addressed in future research."

          "abstract": "PurposeOsteoarthritis (OA) is a frequently occurring, chronic condition; however, few studies describe the clinical characteristics of individuals with OA and the treatments they use to manage their symptoms. We conducted a study to characterize the OA population in the US and describe the nonsurgical management used by this population based on consumer research data collected through an online survey.MethodsData from the 2017 US National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) for adults aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a535 years were used to evaluate the relationship between OA and certain study participant characteristics and to identify the most commonly used treatment options. NHWS data were collected through a survey of individuals drawn from the internet panel maintained by Lightspeed Research (Bridgewater, New Jersey) and its panel partners. Weighted estimates were generated using data from the 2016 Current Population Survey (Annual Demographics File) of the US Census Bureau. Comparisons between the general and OA populations were made based on body mass index (BMI), exercise frequency, and comorbid diagnoses of hypertension or diabetes. Among the OA population, the use of dietary supplements, prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) treatments with chondroitin with or without glucosamine (Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl), prescription treatment by time since OA diagnosis, and utilization of a physical therapist were also recorded.ResultsThe prevalence of OA in the overall population was 17.6 % and was higher for individuals with a BMI \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 25 (21.9 %), patients diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes (36.2 %), and those who did not exercise regularly (19.0 %). Adults without OA were more likely to exercise regularly (12 days per month or more) than adults diagnosed with OA. Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl (6.0 %) was the most commonly used OTC dietary supplement in the OA population, followed by omega-3 fatty acids (2.8 %), vitamin D (1.9 %), calcium (1.1 %), and multivitamins (0.7 %). Individuals using Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl were more likely to use OTC only products (75.4 % vs 37.3 %) or prescription medications, namely non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or opioids, and OTC products (24.6 % vs 13.0 %) compared with individuals not using Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl, while individuals not using Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl were more likely to be untreated (30.3 % vs 0) or to use prescription medications only (19.4 % vs 0). Nearly 32 % of individuals with OA reported using prescription treatments, and the likelihood of using a prescription treatment increased with number of years since OA diagnosis (<3 years: 27.5 %; \u00e2\u2030\u00a521 years: 32.5 %). The pharmaceutical products used by this population primarily consisted of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and opioids. Approximately 13 % of patients with OA had visited a physical therapist in the past 6 months.ConclusionsThe prevalence of OA was higher in those with a high BMI, and comorbid diabetes or hypertension. Individuals with OA using Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl primarily reported use of OTC products only or used them in combination with prescription products. The likelihood of using prescription products increased with the length of OA history. These data provide valuable new information about demographics, clinical characteristics, and commonly used prescription and OTC treatments and dietary supplements in the OA population."

          "abstract": "Policymakers everywhere are working to determine the set of restrictions that will effectively contain the spread of COVID-19 without excessively stifling economic activity. We show that publicly available data on human mobility-collected by Google, Facebook, and other providers-can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and forecast the spread of COVID-19. This approach uses simple and transparent statistical models to estimate the effect of NPIs on mobility, and basic machine learning methods to generate 10-day forecasts of COVID-19 cases. An advantage of the approach is that it involves minimal assumptions about disease dynamics, and requires only publicly-available data. We evaluate this approach using local and regional data from China, France, Italy, South Korea, and the United States, as well as national data from 80 countries around the world. We find that NPIs are associated with significant reductions in human mobility, and that changes in mobility can be used to forecast COVID-19 infections."

          "abstract": "Here we report on an EHV-1 outbreak investigation caused by a novel genotype H752 (histidine in amino acid position 752 of the ORF 30 gene). The outbreak involved 31 performance horses. Horses were monitored over a period of 35 days for clinical signs, therapeutic outcome and qPCR results of EHV-1 in blood and nasal secretions. The morbidity of the EHV-1 outbreak was 84% with 26 clinically infected horses displaying fever and less frequently anorexia and distal limb edema. Four horses showed mild transient neurological deficits. Clinically diseased horses experienced high viral load of EHV-1 in blood and/or nasal secretions via qPCR, while subclinically infected horses had detectable EHV-1 mainly in nasal secretions. The majority of infected horses showed a rise in antibody titers to EHV-1 during the outbreak. All 31 horses were treated with valacyclovir, while clinically infected horses further received flunixin meglumine and sodium heparin. This investigation highlights various relevant aspects of an EHV-1 outbreak caused by a new H752 genotype: (i) importance of early detection of EHV-1 infection; (ii) diagnostic challenge to assess H752 genotype; (iii) apparent benefit of valacyclovir use in the early stage of the outbreak; and (iv) weekly testing of blood and nasal secretions by qPCR in order to monitor individual infection status and lift quarantine."

We defined maternal nativity as US-born or foreign-born. Using Poisson regression, we computed risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for three adverse perinatal outcomes: preterm birth, small for gestational age deliveries, and infant mortality.ResultsRates of adverse perinatal outcomes were significantly higher among US-born Black women. In adjusted models, US-born Black women experienced an increased risk of preterm birth (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.39, 1.65) and small for gestational age deliveries (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.41, 1.64), compared to foreign-born Black women.ConclusionsFuture studies should consider experiences of racism across the life course when exploring heterogeneity in the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes by nativity among Black women in the US."

          "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the most common (90%) and aggressive type of pancreatic cancer. Genomic analyses of PDA specimens have identified the recurrent genetic mutations that drive PDA initiation and progression. However, the underlying mechanisms that further drive PDA metastasis remain elusive. Despite many attempts, no recurrent genetic mutation driving PDA metastasis has been found, suggesting that PDA metastasis is driven by epigenetic fluctuations rather than genetic factors. Therefore, establishing epigenetic mechanisms of PDA metastasis would facilitate the development of successful therapeutic interventions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview on the role of epigenetic mechanisms in PDA as a critical contributor on PDA progression and metastasis. In particular, we explore the recent advancements elucidating the role of nucleosome remodeling, histone modification, and DNA methylation in the process of cancer metastasis."

Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used to determine the prognostic factors affecting survival. \u00cf\u20212 test was used to assess the correlation.ResultsIncidence of hand and wrist sarcoma was 0.017 per 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2030000 persons in 2017 and has not significantly changed since 1975 (p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030>\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.05).

          "abstract": "Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, with multiple underlying inflammatory pathways and structural airway abnormalities that impact disease persistence and severity. Recent progress has been made in developing targeted asthma therapeutics, especially for subjects with eosinophilic asthma. However, there is an unmet need for new approaches to treat patients with severe and exacerbation-prone asthma, who contribute disproportionately to disease burden. Extensive deep phenotyping has revealed the heterogeneous nature of severe asthma and identified distinct disease subtypes. A&nbsp;current challenge in the field is to translate new and emerging knowledge about different pathobiologic mechanisms in asthma into patient-specific therapies, with the ultimate goal of modifying the natural history of disease. Here, we describe the Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network, a groundbreaking collaborative effort of asthma researchers and biostatisticians from around the United States. The PrecISE Network was designed to conduct phase II/proof-of-concept clinical trials of precision interventions in the population with severe asthma, and is supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. Using an innovative adaptive platform trial design, the PrecISE Network will evaluate up to 6 interventions simultaneously in biomarker-defined subgroups of subjects. We review the development and organizational structure of the PrecISE Network, and choice of interventions being studied. We hope that the PrecISE Network will enhance our understanding of asthma subtypes and accelerate the development of therapeutics for severe asthma."

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study is to culturally adapt the RDAD for persons with dementia living in community settings of Thailand. METHODS: Key adaptation steps included: 1) assess the community, 2) understand/select the intervention, 3) consult with experts/stakeholders, 4) decide what needs to be adapted, 5) adapt the original program, 6) train staff, and 7) pilot test the adapted materials. RESULTS: Modifications to the original RDAD protocol included changes in number of sessions, mode of delivery, and the specific pleasant activities targeted. The pilot test demonstrated the feasibility and acceptance of the adapted RDAD intervention protocol. Implementers were able to comprehend and implement the core components of the intervention, while family members demonstrated ability to follow instructions, gain knowledge about dementia, and improve skills for setting up realistic goals. CONCLUSION: Following the key adaptation steps outlined above, we were able to successfully modify the RDAD for the Thai cultural context, maintaining core components of the original protocol. Program implementers demonstrated their ability to supervise family caregivers and help them gain the knowledge and skills needed to provide care for older adults with dementia. Findings from the pilot studies were incorporated into final training and intervention protocols currently being implemented and evaluated in a randomized implementation trial in Thailand."

          "abstract": "Depression among individuals who have been racially and ethnically minoritized in the United States can be vastly different from that of non-Hispanic White Americans. For example, African American adults who have depression rate their symptoms as more severe, have a longer course of illness, and experience more depression-associated disability. The purpose of this review was to conceptualize how structural racism and cumulative trauma can be fundamental drivers of the intergenerational transmission of depression. The authors propose that understanding risk factors for depression, particularly its intergenerational reach, requires accounting for structural racism. In light of the profoundly different experiences of African Americans who experience depression (i.e., a more persistent course of illness and greater disability), it is critical to examine whether an emerging explanation for some of these differences is the intergenerational transmission of this disorder due to structural racism."

Treatment options for AF are limited; moreover, the development of new treatments is hindered by limited (1) knowledge regarding human atrial electrophysiological endpoints (e.g., conduction velocity [CV]) and (2) accurate experimental models. Here, we measured the CV and refractory period, and subsequently calculated the conduction wavelength, in vivo (four subjects with AF and four controls), and ex vivo (atrial slices from human hearts). Then, we created an in vitro model of human atrial conduction using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. This model consisted of iPS-derived human atrial cardiomyocytes plated onto a micropatterned linear 1D spiral design of Matrigel. The CV (34-41\u00e2\u20ac\u2030cm/s) of the in vitro model was nearly five times faster than 2D controls (7-9&nbsp;cm/s) and similar to in vivo (40-64\u00e2\u20ac\u2030cm/s) and ex vivo (28-51\u00e2\u20ac\u2030cm/s) measurements.

A multicenter randomized clinical trial compared 2 strategies for medical management and found that mifepristone pretreatment is 25% more effective than the standard of care, misoprostol alone. The cost of mifepristone may be a barrier to implementation of the regimen.ObjectiveTo assess the cost-effectiveness of medical management of EPL with mifepristone pretreatment plus misoprostol vs misoprostol alone in the United States.Design, setting, and participantsThis preplanned. prospective economic evaluation was performed concurrently with a randomized clinical trial in 3 US sites from May 1, 2014, through April 30, 2017. Participants included 300 women with anembryonic gestation or embryonic or fetal demise. Cost-effectiveness was computed from the health care sector and societal perspectives, with a 30-day time horizon. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2018, to July 3, 2019.InterventionsMifepristone pretreatment plus misoprostol administration vs misoprostol alone.Main outcomes and measuresCosts in 2018 US dollars, effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and treatment efficacy. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of mifepristone and misoprostol vs misoprostol alone were calculated, and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated.ResultsAmong the 300 women included in the randomized clinical trial (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [6.2] years), mean costs were similar for groups receiving mifepristone pretreatment and misoprostol alone from the health care sector perspective ($696.75 [95% CI, $591.88-$801.62] vs $690.88 [95% CI, $562.38-$819.38]; P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.94) and the societal perspective ($3846.30 [95% CI, $2783.01-$4909.58] vs $4845.62 [95% CI, $3186.84-$6504.41]; P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.32). The mifepristone pretreatment group had higher QALYs (0.0820 [95% CI, 0.0815-0.0825] vs 0.0806 [95% CI, 0.0800-0.0812]; P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.001) and a higher completion rate after first treatment (83.8% vs 67.1%; P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.001) than the group receiving misoprostol alone. From the health care sector perspective, mifepristone pretreatment was cost-effective relative to misoprostol alone with an ICER of $4225.43 (95% CI, -$195 053.30 to $367 625.10) per QALY gained. From the societal perspective, mifepristone pretreatment dominated misoprostol alone (95% CI, -$5\u00e2\u20ac\u00af111\u00e2\u20ac\u00af629 to $1\u00e2\u20ac\u00af801\u00e2\u20ac\u00af384). The probabilities that mifepristone pretreatment was cost-effective compared with misoprostol alone at a willingness-to-pay of $150\u00e2\u20ac\u00af000 per QALY gained from the health care sector and societal perspectives were approximately 90% and 80%, respectively.Conclusions and relevanceThis study found that medical management of EPL with mifepristone pretreatment was cost-effective when compared with misoprostol alone.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02012491."

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: Limited data are available on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We examined the clinical features and outcomes of 190 patients treated with ECMO within 14&nbsp;days of ICU admission, using data from a multicenter cohort study of 5122 critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to 68 hospitals across the United States. To estimate the effect of ECMO on mortality, we emulated a target trial of ECMO receipt versus no ECMO receipt within 7&nbsp;days of ICU admission among mechanically ventilated patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u2030100). Patients were followed until hospital discharge, death, or a minimum of 60&nbsp;days. We adjusted for confounding using a multivariable Cox model. RESULTS: Among the 190 patients treated with ECMO, the median age was 49&nbsp;years (IQR 41-58), 137 (72.1%) were men, and the median PaO2/FiO2 prior to ECMO initiation was 72 (IQR 61-90). At 60&nbsp;days, 63 patients (33.2%) had died, 94 (49.5%) were discharged, and 33 (17.4%) remained hospitalized. Among the 1297 patients eligible for the target trial emulation, 45 of the 130 (34.6%) who received ECMO died, and 553 of the 1167 (47.4%) who did not receive ECMO died. In the primary analysis, patients who received ECMO had lower mortality than those who did not (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.41-0.74). Results were similar in a secondary analysis limited to patients with PaO2/FiO2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u203080 (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.40-0.77). CONCLUSION: In select patients with severe respiratory failure from COVID-19, ECMO may reduce mortality."

          "abstract": "Black men are disproportionately affected by firearm assaults in the United States, and these disparities are rooted in structural and social inequities. The objective of this scoping review of research was to identify risk and protective factors for firearm assault injuries among Black men at all levels of the social-ecological framework. The search was conducted in 2021. The initial search generated 1,122 articles. Studies were eligible if they (a) included an analysis of modifiable risk or protective factors for firearm assaults among Black men; (b) reported an estimate of correlation, association, or effect between risk or protective factors and firearm assault injuries, firearm violence, and/or firearm homicides; and (c) were published peer-reviewed articles. In all, 19 articles were identified for review. Risk factors identified at each ecological level include the following: (1) Individual: firearm possession/weapon use and criminal legal system interaction; (2) Relationships: gang membership and exposure to other people who have experienced a firearm assault; (3) Community: indicators for socioeconomic status and racial residential segregation; and (4) Societal: historical racist policy. Individual-level substance use had mixed results. Few (26%) studies examined protective factors at any ecological level, but community-level factors like neighborhood tree cover were identified. Future research needs to examine risk and protective factors at the societal level and multiple ecological levels simultaneously leading to more effective multi-level interventions that will guide policy formation. A greater diversity of study designs, research methods, and theoretical frameworks is needed to better understand factors associated with firearm assault among Black men."

          "abstract": "Context: Health plan disenrollment has been associated with higher mortality in patients with opioid use disorder. Insurance loss and health plan disenrollment might be downstream social consequences of opioid misuse and overdose that may heighten patient mortality risks during a period of heightened need for professional assistance. Objective: To test hypotheses that: 1) overdose events in patients prescribed long-term opioids are associated with subsequent health plan disenrollment; and 2) buprenorphine initiation after overdose would attenuate this association. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Dataset: Data from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse which includes de-identified medical and pharmacy claims and enrollment records for commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees. The database contains longitudinal health information on patients, representing a mixture of ages, ethnicities, and geographical regions across the United States. Population studied: Adults (aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a518 years) prescribed stable, opioid therapy for a 6-month baseline period (\u00e2\u2030\u00a590% of days covered, <10% monthly fluctuation from 6-month average, average daily dose \u00e2\u2030\u00a510 morphine milligram equivalents). Outcome Measures: Health plan disenrollment during up to one year of follow-up. Negative binomial regression estimated adjusted incidence rate ratios of disenrollment by incident overdose and buprenorphine initiation after overdose. Results: We identified 556,676 patients who were followed up after 1,119,100 stable periods of opioid therapy. During follow-up, 17.5% of person-periods ended in health plan disenrollment. Overdose events during follow-up were associated with health plan disenrollment with a dose-response relationship [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) for 1 overdose event = 1.29 (95% CI: 1.24-1.35); aIRR for \u00e2\u2030\u00a52 overdose events = 1.51 (1.43-1.59)]. Among patients with overdose events, subsequent buprenorphine initiation was associated with substantially reduced risk of health plan disenrollment [aIRR 0.36 (0.17-0.74)]. Conclusions: Overdose events in patients prescribed long-term opioids may portend other social consequences, such as health insurance loss, which may exacerbate patient risk at a time of heightened need and vulnerability. Buprenorphine may mitigate the risk of health plan disenrollment in opioid-prescribed patients who overdose."

          "abstract": "Understanding and treating human diseases require valid animal models. Leveraging the genetic diversity in rhesus macaque populations across eight primate centers in the United States, we conduct targeted-sequencing on 1845 individuals for 374 genes linked to inherited human retinal and neurodevelopmental diseases. We identify over 47,000 single nucleotide variants, a substantial proportion of which are shared with human populations. By combining rhesus and human allele frequencies with established variant prediction methods, we develop a machine learning-based score that outperforms established methods in predicting missense variant pathogenicity. Remarkably, we find a marked number of loss-of-function variants and putative deleterious variants, which may lead to the development of rhesus disease models. Through phenotyping of macaques carrying a pathogenic OPA1:p.A8S variant, we identify a genetic model of autosomal dominant optic atrophy. Finally, we present a public website housing variant and genotype data from over two thousand rhesus macaques."

          "abstract": "Seagrasses and related aquatic vegetation have declined extensively in the U.S. and worldwide in recent years due to habitat degradation and reduced water quality.  More importantly, over 90% of coastal wetlands have been destroyed in many regions of California.  In light of this decline and the recognized importance of eelgrass populations to the overall health of coastal systems, there is a significant need to understand patterns of genetic variation in these populations.  This information is critical to assessing the ecological interactions among eelgrass and its associated species.  Furthermore, due to the priority of these systems for restoration and conservation projects, research examining the role of genetic diversity in ecosystem function is vital to ensure the success of these attempts and the future health of Z marina populations.  To address these goals, I will evaluate patterns of genetic variation within and among eelgrass populations.  This information will then be incorporated into experiments examining the linkages between genetic diversity, community structure, and ecosystem function.  Ultimately, the results of these experiments can be utilized to plan and evaluate eelgrass restoration efforts."

The lack of physical activity among children is, in part, associated with travel behavior and urban form (Ewing et al, 2003, Handy et al, 2002; Martin-Diener et al, 2005): children living in auto-oriented areas in the U.S. use walking and biking as modes of transportation to nearby destinations to a limited extent and less than in the past (Sallis et al, 1993; Sallis et al 2000). Their high level of auto use is, of course, tied to a high level of auto use among their parents, particularly their mothers (McMillan, 2007).For children, much discussion has focused on the journey to school, though researchers are now addressing non-school travel as well. According to McDonald (2006), who studied children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travel patterns based on the National Household Travel Survey, only 12% of the trips to sport activities are made by bike. The NHTS data do not allow a full estimate of non-motorized trips taken alone, versus trips taken with a parent, but it is reasonable to assume that use of bikes is even lower when parents are involved in the trip. Copperman and Bhat (2007) analyzed the determinants of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekend physical activity participation using data from the 2000 Bay Area travel survey. Their models correlate socio-demographic and land use variables with active and passive travel (i.e. non-motorized and motorized) and with physically active and passive activities. Their findings suggest that children (ages 5 to 17) rarely use non-motorized modes to get to places where they engage in physical activities, and that individual and household demographics, along with environmental factors, affect the level of physical activity.One place where children might be expected to use non-motorized modes to get to after-school activities is Davis, CA, well-known as a bicycle-friendly community. In Fall 2006, the Davis chapter of the American Youth Soccer Organization (Davis AYSO) set out to increase bicycling to soccer games through a two-pronged approach. First, the organization adopted a new approach to scheduling games, spreading them to fields throughout Davis rather than scheduling as many games as possible at three centralized fields. For most games, at least one team (and often both) was scheduled for a field within their neighborhood. In addition, Davis AYSO undertook a promotional program to encourage families to bike to games, including distribution of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bike to AYSO\u00e2\u20ac\u009d bike stickers, the creation of a special web site that included a Davis Bike Map, and e-mail announcements to almost all families about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bike to AYSO\u00e2\u20ac\u009d effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of this program in encouraging players and their families to bike more frequently, Davis AYSO worked with researchers at the University of California, Davis. This report describes the methods used in that effort and summarizes the results."

          "abstract": "Background: The utility of incorporating detailed family history into breast cancer risk prediction hinges on its independent contribution to breast cancer risk. We evaluated associations between detailed family history and breast cancer risk while accounting for breast density.Methods: We followed 222,019 participants ages 35 to 74 in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, of whom 2,456 developed invasive breast cancer. We calculated standardized breast cancer risks within joint strata of breast density and simple (1st-degree female relative) or detailed (first-degree, second-degree, or first- and second-degree female relative) breast cancer family history. We fit log-binomial models to estimate age-specific breast cancer associations for simple and detailed family history, accounting for breast density.Results: Simple first-degree family history was associated with increased breast cancer risk compared with no first-degree history [Risk ratio (RR), 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-2.1 at age 40; RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7 at age 50; RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6 at age 60; RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5 at age 70). Breast cancer associations with detailed family history were strongest for women with first- and second-degree family history compared with no history (RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.2 at age 40); this association weakened in higher age groups (RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.88-1.5 at age 70). Associations did not change substantially when adjusted for breast density.Conclusions: Even with adjustment for breast density, a history of breast cancer in both first- and second-degree relatives is more strongly associated with breast cancer than simple first-degree family history.Impact: Future efforts to improve breast cancer risk prediction models should evaluate detailed family history as a risk factor.

          "abstract": "BackgroundBreast cancer prevalence is higher among female orthopaedic surgeons compared with U.S. women. The most common breast cancer site, the upper outer quadrant (UOQ), may not be adequately shielded from intraoperative radiation. Factors associated with higher breast radiation exposure (protective apron size and type, surgeon position, and C-arm position) have yet to be established.MethodsAn anthropomorphic torso phantom, simulating the female surgeon, was placed adjacent to a standard operating table. Dosimeters were placed over the UOQ and lower inner quadrant (LIQ) of the breast, bilaterally. Scatter radiation dose-equivalent rates were measured during continuous fluoroscopy to a pelvic phantom (simulating the patient). Four apron sizes (small, medium, large, and extra-large), 2 apron types (cross-back and vest), 2 surgeon positions (facing the table and 90\u00c2\u00b0 to the table), and 2 C-arm positions (anteroposterior and cross-table lateral projection) were tested.ResultsThe median dose-equivalent rate of scatter radiation to the UOQ (0.40 mrem/hr) was higher than that to the LIQ of the breast (0.06 mrem/hr) across all testing, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.05). The cross-back aprons provided higher protection to the LIQ compared with the vests (p < 0.05). Lead protection in sizes that were too small or too large for the torso had higher breast radiation dose-equivalent rates. C-arm cross-table lateral projection was associated with higher breast radiation exposure (0.98 mrem/hr) compared with anteroposterior projection (0.13 mrem/hr) (p < 0.001).ConclusionsBreast radiation exposure is higher in a C-arm lateral projection compared with an anteroposterior projection. Higher dose-equivalent rates were observed for the UOQ compared with the LIQ of the breast and for aprons that were too small or too large, although these differences did not reach significance. Factors that may reduce radiation exposure include lead protection of appropriate size and distancing the axilla from the patient and x-ray tube.Clinical relevanceIncreased breast cancer prevalence has been reported for female orthopaedic surgeons. The UOQ of the breast may be at risk for intraoperative radiation exposure. Methods of reducing exposure are warranted."

          "abstract": "Soybean oil consumption is increasing worldwide and parallels a rise in obesity. Rich in unsaturated fats, especially linoleic acid, soybean oil is assumed to be healthy, and yet it induces obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and fatty liver in mice. Here, we show that the genetically modified soybean oil Plenish, which came on the U.S. market in 2014 and is low in linoleic acid, induces less obesity than conventional soybean oil in C57BL/6 male mice. Proteomic analysis of the liver reveals global differences in hepatic proteins when comparing diets rich in the two soybean oils, coconut oil, and a low-fat diet. Metabolomic analysis of the liver and plasma shows a positive correlation between obesity and hepatic C18 oxylipin metabolites of omega-6 (\u00cf\u20306) and omega-3 (\u00cf\u20303) fatty acids (linoleic and \u00ce\u00b1-linolenic acid, respectively) in the cytochrome P450/soluble epoxide hydrolase pathway. While Plenish induced less insulin resistance than conventional soybean oil, it resulted in hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction as did olive oil, which has a similar fatty acid composition. These results implicate a new class of compounds in diet-induced obesity-C18 epoxide and diol oxylipins."

          "abstract": "Prioritizing the potential risk posed to human health by chemicals requires tools that can estimate exposure from limited information. In this study, chemical structure and physicochemical properties were used to predict the probability that a chemical might be associated with any of four exposure pathways leading from sources-consumer (near-field), dietary, far-field industrial, and far-field pesticide-to the general population. The balanced accuracies of these source-based exposure pathway models range from 73 to 81%, with the error rate for identifying positive chemicals ranging from 17 to 36%. We then used exposure pathways to organize predictions from 13 different exposure models as well as other predictors of human intake rates. We created a consensus, meta-model using the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models framework in which the predictors of exposure were combined by pathway and weighted according to predictive ability for chemical intake rates inferred from human biomonitoring data for 114 chemicals. The consensus model yields an R2 of \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc0.8. We extrapolate to predict relevant pathway(s), median intake rate, and credible interval for 479\u00e2\u20ac\u00af926 chemicals, mostly with minimal exposure information. This approach identifies 1880 chemicals for which the median population intake rates may exceed 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight/day, while there is 95% confidence that the median intake rate is below 1 \u00ce\u00bcg/kg BW/day for&nbsp;474572&nbsp;compounds."

The MVP-R (Amphora\u00c2\u00ae, formerly known as Acidform) and N-9 were provided in pre-filled, single-use applicators. Women were instructed to use 1 applicator immediately before or up to 1 hour before vaginal intercourse, and to reapply product if more than 1 hour elapsed and for additional intercourse within 1 hour.

Participants had up to three screening cycles with menstrual product collection for alkaline hematin blood-loss measurements. Investigators enrolled those with two menses with blood loss of 80 mL or more (values averaged for baseline blood loss), placed the IUD, and followed participants for up to six 28-day cycles. Participants collected any menstrual products used during cycles 3 and 6 for blood-loss measurement. We evaluated outcomes in participants with at least one follow-up assessment for the primary outcome of median absolute blood-loss change and, secondarily, treatment success , defined as the proportion with a final measured blood loss less than 80 mL and at least 50% reduction from baseline. We evaluated exploratory outcomes of differences in blood-loss changes by BMI and parity using Wilcoxon rank sum test.ResultsOf 105 enrolled participants, 47 (44.8%) had obesity (BMI 30.0 or higher) and 29 (27.6%) were nulliparous. Baseline mean blood loss ranged from 73 to 520 mL (median 143 mL, interquartile range 112-196 mL). Eighty-nine (84.8%) had at least one evaluable follow-up evaluation.

          "abstract": "Lactase persistence (LP) is a trait in which lactose can be digested throughout adulthood, while lactase non-persistence (LNP) can cause lactose intolerance and influence dairy consumption. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP ID: rs4988235) is often used as a predictor for dairy intake, since it is responsible for LP in people in European descent, and can occur in other ethnic groups. The objective of this study was to determine whether rs4988235 genotypes and ethnicity influence reported dairy consumption in the United States (U.S.). A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and multiple Automated Self-Administered 24-h recalls (ASA24\u00c2\u00ae) were used to measure habitual and recent intake, respectively, of total dairy, cheese, cow's milk, plant-based alternative milk, and yogurt in a multi-ethnic U.S. cohort genotyped for rs4988235. Within Caucasian subjects, LP individuals reported consuming more recent total dairy and habitual total cow's milk intake. For subjects of all ethnicities, LP individuals consumed more cheese (FFQ p = 0.043, ASA24 p = 0.012) and recent total dairy (ASA24 p = 0.005). For both dietary assessments, Caucasians consumed more cheese than all non-Caucasians (FFQ p = 0.036, ASA24 p = 0.002) independent of genotype, as well as more recent intake of yogurt (ASA24 p = 0.042). LP subjects consumed more total cow's milk than LNP, but only when accounting for whether subjects were Caucasian or not (FFQ p = 0.015). Fluid milk and alternative plant-based milk consumption were not associated with genotypes or ethnicity. Our results show that both LP genotype and ethnicity influence the intake of some dairy products in a multi-ethnic U.S. cohort, but the ability of rs4988235 genotypes to predict intake may depend on ethnic background, the specific dairy product, and whether intake is reported on a habitual or recent basis. Therefore, ethnicity and the dietary assessment method should also be considered when determining the suitability of rs4988235 as a proxy for dairy intake."

          "abstract": "1. The changing climate is altering species distributions with consequences for population dynamics, resulting in winners and losers in the Anthropocene. 2. Agraulis vanillae, the gulf fritillary butterfly, has expanded its range in the past 100 years in the western U.S.A. Time series analysis is combined with species distribution modelling to investigate factors limiting the distribution of A. vanillae and to predict future shifts under warming scenarios. 3. Time series analyses from the western U.S.A. show that urban development has a positive association with year of colonisation (the host plant Passiflora is an ornamental in gardens). Colonisation was also associated positively and to a lesser extent with winter maximum temperatures, whereas a negative impact of minimum temperatures and precipitation was apparent on population growth rates after establishment. 4. Species distribution models vary by region. In the eastern U.S.A., the butterfly is primarily limited by minimum temperatures in the winter and host availability later in the season. Eastern U.S. projected expansion broadly follows the expectation of poleward distributional shifts, especially for the butterfly's maximum annual extent. Western U.S. distributions are limited by the host plant, which in turn is dependent on urban centres. Projected western U.S. expansion is not limited to a single direction and is driven by urban centres becoming more suitable for the host plant. 5. These results demonstrate the value of combining time series with spatial modelling, at the same time as incorporating biotic interactions, aiming to understand and predict shifting geographical ranges in the Anthropocene."

          "title": "The Potential Production of the Bioactive Compound Pinene Using Whey Permeate",
          "abstract": "Pinene is a secondary plant metabolite that has functional properties as a flavor additive as well as potential cognitive health benefits. Although pinene is present in low concentrations in several plants, it is possible to engineer microorganisms to produce pinene. However, feedstock cost is currently limiting the industrial scale-up of microbial pinene production. One potential solution is to leverage waste streams such as whey permeate as an alternative to expensive feedstocks. Whey permeate is a sterile-filtered dairy effluent that contains 4.5% weight/weight lactose, and it must be processed or disposed of due its high biochemical oxygen demand, often at significant cost to the producer. Approximately 180 million m3 of whey is produced annually in the U.S., and only half of this quantity receives additional processing for the recovery of lactose. Given that organisms such as recombinant Escherichia coli grow on untreated whey permeate, there is an opportunity for dairy producers to microbially produce pinene and reduce the biological oxygen demand of whey permeate via microbial lactose consumption. The process would convert a waste stream into a valuable coproduct. This review examines the current approaches for microbial pinene production, and the suitability of whey permeate as a medium for microbial pinene production."

          "abstract": "US nursing homes are required to have sufficient nursing staff with the appropriate competencies to assure resident safety and attain or maintain the highest practicable level of physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident. Minimum nurse staffing levels have been identified in research studies and recommended by experts. Beyond the minimum levels, nursing homes must take into account the resident acuity to assure they have adequate staffing levels to meet the needs of residents. This paper presents a guide for determining whether a nursing home has adequate and appropriate nurse staffing. We propose five basic steps to: (1) determine the collective resident acuity and care needs, (2) determine the actual nurse staffing levels, (3) identify appropriate nurse staffing levels to meet residents care needs, (4) examine evidence regarding the adequacy of staffing, and (5) identify gaps between the actual staffing and the appropriate nursing staffing levels based on resident acuity. Data sources and specific methodologies are analyzed, compared, and recommended. The goal is to assist nursing home nurses and administrators to ensure adequate nursing home staffing levels that protect resident health, safety, and well-being."

          "abstract": "The spread of Aedes aegypti in California and other regions of the U.S. has increased the need to understand the potential for local chains of Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission, particularly in arid regions where the ecology of these mosquitoes is less understood. For public health and vector control programs, it is helpful to know whether variation in risk of local transmission can be attributed to socio-demographic factors that could help to target surveillance and control programs. Socio-demographic factors have been shown to influence transmission risk of dengue virus outside the U.S. by modifying biting rates and vector abundance. In regions of the U.S. where Ae. aegypti have recently invaded and where residential areas are structured differently than those in the tropics where Ae. aegypti are endemic, it is unclear how socio-demographic factors modify the abundance of Ae. aegypti populations. Understanding heterogeneities among households in Ae. aegypti abundance will provide a better understanding of local vectorial capacity and is an important component of understanding risk of local Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Los Angeles County, California during summer 2017 to understand the causes of variation in relative abundance of Ae. aegypti among households. We surveyed 161 houses, representing a wide range of incomes. Surveys consisted of systematic adult mosquito collections, inspections of households and properties, and administration of a questionnaire in English or Spanish. Adult Ae. aegypti were detected at 72% of households overall and were found indoors at 12% of households. An average of 3.1 Ae. aegypti were collected per household. Ae. aegypti abundance outdoors was higher in lower-income neighborhoods and around older households with larger outdoor areas, greater densities of containers with standing water, less frequent yard maintenance, and greater air-conditioner use. We also found that Ae. aegypti abundance indoors was higher in households that had less window and door screening, less air-conditioner usage, more potted plants indoors, more rain-exposed containers around the home, and lower neighborhood human population densities. Our results indicate that, in the areas of southern California studied, there are behavioral and socio-demographic determinants of Ae. aegypti abundance, and that low-income households could be at higher risk for exposure to Ae. aegypti biting and potentially greater risk for Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus transmission if a local outbreak were to occur."

          "abstract": "BackgroundWith almost 17 million U.S. cancer survivors, understanding multilevel factors impacting health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is critical to improving survivorship outcomes. Few studies have evaluated neighborhood impact on HRQOL among cancer survivors.MethodsWe combined sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral data from three registry-based studies in California. Using a three-level mixed linear regression model (participants nested within block groups and study/regions), we examined associations of both independent neighborhood attributes and neighborhood archetypes, which capture interactions inherent among neighborhood attributes, with two HRQOL outcomes, physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) composite scores.ResultsFor the 2,477 survivors, 46% were 70+ years, 52% were non-Hispanic White, and 53% had localized disease. In models minimally adjusted for age, stage, and cancer recurrence, HRQOL was associated with neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), racial/ethnic composition, population density, street connectivity, restaurant environment index, traffic density, urbanicity, crowding, rental properties, and non-single family units. In fully adjusted models, higher nSES remained associated with better PCS, and restaurant environment index, specifically more unhealthy restaurants, associated with worse MCS. In multivariable-adjusted models of neighborhood archetype, compared with upper middle-class suburb, Hispanic small town and inner city had lower PCS, and high status had higher MCS.ConclusionsAmong survivors, higher nSES was associated with better HRQOL; more unhealthy restaurants were associated with worse HQROL. As some neighborhood archetypes were associated with HRQOL, they provide an approach to capture how neighborhood attributes interact to impact HRQOL.ImpactElucidating the pathways through which neighborhood attributes influence HRQOL is important in improving survivorship outcomes."

          "abstract": "BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rapidly increasing in the U.S. and is a leading cause of mortality for patients with cirrhosis. Discovering novel biomarkers for risk stratification of HCC is paramount. We examined biomarkers of the gut-liver axis in a prospective multicenter cohort.MethodsPatients with cirrhosis without a history of HCC were recruited between May 2015 and March 2020 and prospectively followed at 3 tertiary care hospitals in Los Angeles. Microbiome analysis was performed on duodenal biopsies and metabolomic analysis was performed on serum samples, collected at the time of enrollment. Optimal microbiome-based survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were used to determine microbiota and metabolite associations with HCC development, respectively.ResultsA total of 227 participants with liver cirrhosis contributed a total of 459.58 person-years of follow-up, with 14 incident HCC diagnoses.

Each SWD was matched with 2 controls, one from their institution and, whenever possible, one from their cohort for Medical College Admission Test score and self-reported gender. Outcome measures included final attempt Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge scores, time to graduation, leave of absence, matching on first attempt, and matching to primary care.ResultsA total of 171 SWDs and 341 controls were included; the majority of SWDs had cognitive/learning disabilities (118/171, 69.0%). Compared with controls, SWDs with physical/sensory disabilities had similar times to graduation (88.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.0, 100.0 vs 95.1%, 95% CI: 90.3, 99.8; P = .20), Step 1 scores (229.6 vs 233.4; P = .118), and match on first attempt (93.9%, 95% CI: 86.9, 100.0 vs 94.6%, 95% CI: 91.8, 97.4; P = .842), while SWDs with cognitive/learning disabilities had lower Step 1 scores (219.4; P < .001) and were less likely to graduate on time (81.2%, 95% CI: 69.2, 93.2; P = .003) and match on first attempt (85.3%, 95% CI: 78.0, 92.7; P = .009).

In this study, we examine glycemic control in relation to cognitive aging and impairment in a large prospective cohort of middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals of diverse heritages.Research design and methodsStudy of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) is a Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) ancillary study. HCHS/SOL is a multisite (Bronx, NY; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; and San Diego, CA), probability sampled prospective cohort study. SOL-INCA enrolled 6,377 diverse Hispanic/Latino individuals aged 50 years and older (2016-2018). The primary outcomes were cognitive function, 7-year cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The primary glycemia exposure variables were measured from fasting blood samples collected at HCHS/SOL visit 1 (2008-2011).ResultsVisit 1 mean age was 56.5 years \u00c2\u00b1 8.2 SD, and the average glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) was 6.12% (43.5 \u00c2\u00b1 14.6 mmol/mol). After covariate adjustment, higher HbA1c was associated with accelerated 7-year global (b = -0.045; 95% CI -0.070; -0.021; in z score units) and executive cognitive decline and a higher prevalence of MCI (odds ratio 1.20; 95% CI 1.11; 1.29).ConclusionsElevated HbA1c levels were associated with 7-year executive cognitive decline and increased MCI risk among diverse middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals. Our findings indicate that poor glycemic control in midlife may pose significant risks for cognitive decline and MCI later in life among Hispanic/Latino individuals of diverse heritages."

The program is conducted under the auspices of the Georgia Tech Engineering Research Center in Low-Cost Electronic Packaging, which is sponsored by the National Science Foundation. In the GT-SUPREEM program, junior and senior level undergraduate students are selected on a nationwide basis and paired with a faculty advisor to undertake research projects in the Packaging Research Center. The students are housed on campus and provided with a $3,000 stipend and a travel allowance. At the conclusion of the program, the students present both oral and written project summaries. It has been shown that this experience is extremely successful in motivating these students to attend graduate school, with 89% of the participants opting to do so. This paper will provide an overview of the GT-SUPREEM program, including student research activities, success stories, lessons learned, and overall program outlook."

          "abstract": "Diverse motivations for preserving nature both inspire and hinder its conservation. Optimal conservation strategies may differ radically depending on the objective. For example, creating nature reserves may prevent extinctions through protecting severely threatened species, whereas incentivizing farmland hedgerows may benefit people through bolstering pest-eating or pollinating species. Win-win interventions that satisfy multiple objectives are alluring, but can also be elusive. To achieve better outcomes, we developed and implemented a practical typology of nature conservation framed around seven common conservation objectives. Using an intensively studied bird assemblage in southern Costa Rica as a case study, we applied the typology in the context of biodiversity's most pervasive threat: habitat conversion. We found that rural habitats in a varied tropical landscape, comprising small farms, villages, forest fragments, and forest reserves, provided biodiversity-driven processes that benefit people, such as pollination, seed dispersal, and pest consumption. However, species valued for their rarity, endemism, and evolutionary distinctness declined in farmland. Conserving tropical forest on farmland increased species that international tourists value, but not species discussed in Costa Rican newspapers. Despite these observed trade-offs, our analyses also revealed promising synergies. For example, we found that maintaining forest cover surrounding farms in our study region would likely enhance most conservation objectives at minimal expense to others. Overall, our typology provides a framework for resolving the competing objectives of modern conservation."

          "abstract": "Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), an important food legume crop in the semi-arid regions of the world and the second most important pulse crop in India, has an average crop productivity of 780\u00c2\u00a0kg/ha. The relatively low crop yields may be attributed to non-availability of improved cultivars, poor crop husbandry and exposure to a number of biotic and abiotic stresses in pigeonpea growing regions. Narrow genetic diversity in cultivated germplasm has further hampered the effective utilization of conventional breeding as well as development and utilization of genomic tools, resulting in pigeonpea being often referred to as an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcorphan crop legume\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. To enable genomics-assisted breeding in this crop, the pigeonpea genomics initiative (PGI) was initiated in late 2006 with funding from Indian Council of Agricultural Research under the umbrella of Indo-US agricultural knowledge initiative, which was further expanded with financial support from the US National Science Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Plant Genome Research Program and the Generation Challenge Program. As a result of the PGI, the last 3\u00c2\u00a0years have witnessed significant progress in development of both genetic as well as genomic resources in this crop through effective collaborations and coordination of genomics activities across several institutes and countries. For instance, 25 mapping populations segregating for a number of biotic and abiotic stresses have been developed or are under development. An 11X-genome coverage bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library comprising of 69,120 clones have been developed of which 50,000 clones were end sequenced to generate 87,590 BAC-end sequences (BESs). About 10,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from Sanger sequencing and ca. 2\u00c2\u00a0million short ESTs by 454/FLX sequencing have been generated. A variety of molecular markers have been developed from BESs, microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR)-enriched libraries and mining of ESTs and genomic amplicon sequencing. Of about 21,000 SSRs identified, 6,698 SSRs are under analysis along with 670 orthologous genes using a GoldenGate SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping platform, with large scale SNP discovery using Solexa, a next generation sequencing technology, is in progress. Similarly a diversity array technology array comprising of ca. 15,000 features has been developed. In addition, >600 unique nucleotide binding site (NBS) domain containing members of the NBS-leucine rich repeat disease resistance homologs were cloned in pigeonpea; 960 BACs containing these sequences were identified by filter hybridization, BES physical maps developed using high information content fingerprinting. To enrich the genomic resources further, sequenced soybean genome is being analyzed to establish the anchor points between pigeonpea and soybean genomes. In addition, Solexa sequencing is being used to explore the feasibility of generating whole genome sequence. In summary, the collaborative efforts of several research groups under the umbrella of PGI are making significant progress in improving molecular tools in pigeonpea and should significantly benefit pigeonpea genetics and breeding. As these efforts come to fruition, and expanded (depending on funding), pigeonpea would move from an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcorphan legume crop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to one where genomics-assisted breeding approaches for a sustainable crop improvement are routine."

The role of the AhR and its signaling pathway in endogenous physiological functions and its involvement in immune cell development and human diseases has made it a target for development of therapeutic agents. The ability of the AhR to stimulate gene expression in a ligand-specific manner in recombinant mammalian cell lines containing a stably transfected AhR-responsive firefly luciferase or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene permits high throughput chemical screening for AhR activators. The induction of luciferase activity or EGFP fluorescence in these readily available recombinant cell lines occurs in a time-, dose- and AhR-dependent and chemical-specific manner where the magnitude of reporter gene induction is directly proportional to the concentration and potency of the inducing chemical. The AhR agonist activity of positive test chemicals can be confirmed by demonstrating their ability to stimulate expression of CYP1A1, an endogenous AhR-responsive gene, using quantitative real-time PCR. The detailed protocols described here provide step-by-step instructions for detection and characterization of activators of AhR-dependent gene expression that can readily be applied to other appropriate cell lines. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

          "abstract": "Clinical research increasingly relies upon the availability of appropriate genetic materials; however, the proportion of biospecimens from racial/ethnic minority patients and healthy controls are underrepresented, which preclude equitable research across all patient groups for cancer treatment. National Cancer Institute-funded Community Network Program Centers in California, Florida, and New York collaborated with local community partners to conduct three independent formative research studies with diverse (African American, Asian American, Hispanic, and White) participants to explore their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about biobanking, and their experiences with the donation of biospecimens. Our findings demonstrated similarities in overall low knowledge and understanding about the use of biospecimens for research. This was exacerbated for non-English speakers. Racial and ethnic groups differed with regard to a number of factors that are obstacles for participation, e.g., continuing medical mistrust (African Americans), lack of benefit (Hispanics), apprehension about the physical toll of donating (Vietnamese), usage of biospecimen for research (Hmong and Chinese), and suspicion of exploitation by corporate entities (Whites). However, participants uniformly reported general interest and willingness to participate in biobanking for altruistic purposes, particularly to benefit future generations. This interest was framed with a strong admonition that donations should be accompanied by transparency about study sponsorship and ownership, distribution and use of biospecimens, and study information that fit participants' backgrounds and experiences. This cross-cultural regional analysis offers significant insights into the similarities and variations in opinions and perceptions about biobanking and the collection of biospecimens for use in cancer research."

This approach uses simple and transparent statistical models to estimate the effect of NPIs on mobility, and basic machine learning methods to generate 10-day forecasts of COVID-19 cases. An advantage of the approach is that it involves minimal assumptions about disease dynamics, and requires only publicly-available data. We evaluate this approach using local and regional data from China, France, Italy, South Korea, and the United States, as well as national data from 80 countries around the world. We find that NPIs are associated with significant reductions in human mobility, and that changes in mobility can be used to forecast COVID-19 infections."

Thus, understanding species distributions at multiple spatial scales is essential to improve restoration planting success, to enhance long-term ecosystem functioning, and to match restoration planting designs with historic biogeographic distributions. To inform restoration planning, we examined the biogeographic patterns of riparian plant diversity at local and regional scales within a major western U.S.A. drainage, California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley. We analyzed patterns of species richness and complementarity (\u00ce\u00b2-diversity) across two scales: the watershed scale and the floodplain scale. At the watershed scale, spatial patterns of native riparian richness were driven by herbaceous species, whereas woody species were largely cosmopolitan across the nearly 38,000 km 2 study area. At the floodplain scale, riparian floras reflected species richness and dissimilarity patterns related to hydrological and disturbance-driven successional sequences. These findings reinforce the importance of concurrently evaluating both local and regional processes that promote species diversity and distribution of native riparian flora. Furthermore, as restoration activities become more prevalent across the landscape, strategies for restoration outcomes should emulate the patterns of species diversity and biogeographic distributions found at regional scales. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 Society for Ecological Restoration International."

Agraulis vanillae, the gulf fritillary butterfly, has expanded its range in the past 100 years in the western U.S.A. Time series analysis is combined with species distribution modelling to investigate factors limiting the distribution of A. vanillae and to predict future shifts under warming scenarios. 3. Time series analyses from the western U.S.A. show that urban development has a positive association with year of colonisation (the host plant Passiflora is an ornamental in gardens). Colonisation was also associated positively and to a lesser extent with winter maximum temperatures, whereas a negative impact of minimum temperatures and precipitation was apparent on population growth rates after establishment. 4. Species distribution models vary by region. In the eastern U.S.A., the butterfly is primarily limited by minimum temperatures in the winter and host availability later in the season. Eastern U.S. projected expansion broadly follows the expectation of poleward distributional shifts, especially for the butterfly's maximum annual extent. Western U.S. distributions are limited by the host plant, which in turn is dependent on urban centres. Projected western U.S. expansion is not limited to a single direction and is driven by urban centres becoming more suitable for the host plant. 5. These results demonstrate the value of combining time series with spatial modelling, at the same time as incorporating biotic interactions, aiming to understand and predict shifting geographical ranges in the Anthropocene."

          "abstract": "The study of crop origins has traditionally involved identifying geographic areas of high morphological diversity, sampling populations of wild progenitor species, and the archaeological retrieval of macroremains. Recent investigations have added identification of plant microremains (phytoliths, pollen, and starch grains), biochemical and molecular genetic approaches, and dating through (14)C accelerator mass spectrometry. We investigate the origin of domesticated chili pepper, Capsicum annuum, by combining two approaches, species distribution modeling and paleobiolinguistics, with microsatellite genetic data and archaeobotanical data. The combination of these four lines of evidence yields consensus models indicating that domestication of C. annuum could have occurred in one or both of two areas of Mexico: northeastern Mexico and central-east Mexico.

The disease is characterized by distinct necrotic spots on leaves, stems and petioles that eventually expand and cause a dieback of apical tissues. Samples from symptomatic plants tested negative for infection by tomato spotted wilt virus, tobacco streak virus, tobacco etch virus and other known tomato-infecting viruses. A virus-like agent was sap-transmitted from diseased tissue to Nicotiana benthamiana and, when graft-transmitted to tomato, this agent induced chocolate spot symptoms. This virus-like agent also was sap-transmitted to Datura stramonium and Nicotiana glutinosa, but not to a range of non-solanaceous indicator plants. Icosahedral virions ~28\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30&nbsp;nm in diameter were purified from symptomatic N. benthamiana plants. When rub-inoculated onto leaves of N. benthamiana plants, these virions induced symptoms indistinguishable from those in N. benthamiana plants infected with the sap-transmissible virus associated with chocolate spot disease. Tomatoes inoculated with sap or grafted with shoots from N. benthamiana plants infected with purified virions developed typical chocolate spot symptoms, consistent with this virus being the causal agent of the disease. Analysis of nucleic acids associated with purified virions of the chocolate-spot-associated virus, revealed a genome composed of two single-stranded RNAs of ~7.5 and ~5.1&nbsp;kb. Sequence analysis of these RNAs revealed a genome organization similar to recently described torradoviruses, a new group of picorna-like viruses causing necrosis-associated diseases of tomatoes in Europe [tomato torrado virus (ToTV)] and Mexico [tomato apex necrosis virus (ToANV) and tomato marchitez virus (ToMarV)]. Thus, the ~7.5&nbsp;kb and ~5.1&nbsp;kb RNAs of the chocolate-spot-associated virus corresponded to the torradovirus RNA1 and RNA2, respectively; however, sequence comparisons revealed 64\u00e2\u20ac\u201c83% identities with RNA1 and RNA2 sequences of ToTV, ToANV and ToMarV. Together, these results indicate that the chocolate-spot-associated virus is a member of a distinct torradovirus species and, thus, another member of the recently established genus Torradovirus in the family Secoviridae. The name tomato chocolate spot virus is proposed."

          "abstract": "Exceptional exposures of progradational platform margin slopes of Albian age were mapped along a 5-km, near-continuous, dip-oriented transect in northern Mexico with the goal of producing an outcrop model for analogous Cretaceous reservoirs. The study area at the El Cedral is located along the western margin of the Devils River grainstone belt flanking the muddy, intrashelf Maverick Basin. Four relatively complete clinothems and portions of two adjacent clinothems are recognized in the Las Pilas Formation in the study area. The Las Pilas clinothems exhibit complex sigmoid-oblique geometries and have dimensions of 40-60 m of vertical relief, depositional dip angles of foreset beds ranging from 8 to 15\u00c2\u00b0, and dip-oriented lengths of 1-2 km. Internally, in foresets of clinothems, thick- to massively bedded, sigmoid- to oblique-shaped lenses exhibit overlapping, seaward-stepping patterns toward the southeast. The primary sediment fabrics of topset, foreset, and bottomset beds of the Las Pilas clinothems are grainstones and grain-rich packstones. Coated grains are the predominant grain type, with subordinate amounts of micritized mollusk fragments and intraclasts. Porosity is predominantly moldic, but primary interparticle porosity is common. These lime sands were winnowed, coated, and micritized along the high-energy topsets of clinoforms before being exported seaward toward the breakpoint, where they cascaded onto the steep frontal slopes as sporadic grain flows or mass flows. The master bounding surfaces that define the clinothems likely represent episodes of nondeposition and abandonment of the surface, perhaps occurring during shifts in the locus of deposition laterally along the shoal margin. The architecture and composition of the Las Pilas clinoforms provide observable data for comparison with analogous subsurface reservoirs in the Aptian Shuaiba Formation (Bu Hasa field) and Cenomanian Mishrif Formation (e.g., Umm Adalkh field) of the Arabian Gulf."

LOCATION: Oaxaca State, Mexico. TAXON: Broadly defined vegetation types used in state\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 and national\u00e2\u20ac\u0090level vegetation classification systems. These types can be grouped into series representing dry\u00e2\u20ac\u0090to\u00e2\u20ac\u0090wet conditions for tropical and temperate vegetation. METHODS: We used climate exposure analysis to compare current and future climate parameters for the major vegetation types of Oaxaca. This technique integrates a recent vegetation map with historical climate data (1981\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2010) to produce a baseline climate layer that is compared to climate projections made with five different global circulation models for near\u00e2\u20ac\u0090future (2015\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2039) and end\u00e2\u20ac\u0090century (2075\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2099) periods using two emissions scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). We classified the frequency distribution of the baseline climate into five exposure classes where the closer values are to mean climate conditions, the lower the exposure. Future exposure was estimated by classifying the vegetation pixels into the same exposure classes, now based on future climate values. Increased exposure risk was assessed based on the fraction of pixels that moved into higher exposure classes from one period to another. RESULTS AND MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed four general trends: (a) the higher, current track emissions scenario produced much larger end\u00e2\u20ac\u0090century climate exposure; (b) for the tropical vegetation series, tropical evergreen forests are projected as most exposed by end\u00e2\u20ac\u0090century; (c) for the temperate vegetation series the matorral\u00e2\u20ac\u0090shrubland and conifer forests are the most impacted; and (d) the five GCMs considered showed some convergence in their end\u00e2\u20ac\u0090century climate exposure predictions, with coastal and low\u00e2\u20ac\u0090elevation areas of the State projected to experience the greatest exposure, and the interior mountain slopes and central region projected to experience the least exposure and be the most climatically stable."

          "abstract": "BackgroundWild crop relatives have been potentially subjected to stresses on an evolutionary time scale prior to domestication. Among these stresses, drought is one of the main factors limiting crop productivity and its impact is likely to increase under current scenarios of global climate change. We sought to determine to what extent wild common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) exhibited adaptation to drought stress, whether this potential adaptation is dependent on the climatic conditions of the location of origin of individual populations, and to what extent domesticated common bean reflects potential drought adaptation.MethodsAn extensive and diverse set of wild beans from across Mesoamerica, along with a set of reference Mesoamerican domesticated cultivars, were evaluated for root and shoot traits related to drought adaptation. A water deficit experiment was conducted by growing each genotype in a long transparent tube in greenhouse conditions so that root growth, in addition to shoot growth, could be monitored.ResultsPhenotypic and landscape genomic analyses, based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms, suggested that beans originating from central and north-west Mexico and Oaxaca, in the driest parts of their distribution, produced more biomass and were deeper-rooted. Nevertheless, deeper rooting was correlated with less root biomass production relative to total biomass. Compared with wild types, domesticated types showed a stronger reduction and delay in growth and development in response to drought stress. Specific genomic regions were associated with root depth, biomass productivity and drought response, some of which showed signals of selection and were previously related to productivity and drought tolerance.ConclusionsThe drought tolerance of wild beans consists in its stronger ability, compared with domesticated types, to continue growth in spite of water-limited conditions. This study is the first to relate bean response to drought to environment of origin for a diverse selection of wild beans. It provides information that needs to be corroborated in crosses between wild and domesticated beans to make it applicable to breeding programmes."

Due to high rates of brown dog tick infestation, susceptibility, and association with humans, dogs serve as sentinels and have a key role in the ecology of RMSF. A cross-sectional household questionnaire study was conducted in six rural and urban locations to characterize dog ecology and demography in RMSF high-and low-risk areas of Mexicali. In addition, we tracked movement patterns of 16 dogs using a GPS data logger. Of 253 households, 73% owned dogs, and dog ownership tended to be higher in high-risk areas, with a mean dog:human ratio of 0.43, compared with 0.3 in low-risk areas. Dogs in high-risk areas had higher fecundity and roamed more, but the dog density and numbers of free-roaming dogs were comparable. There was a higher proportion of younger dogs and lower proportion of older dogs in high-risk areas. The high proportion of immunologically na\u00c3\u00afve puppies in high risk areas could result in a lack of herd immunity leading to a more vulnerable dog and human population. The marked increase of space use of free-roaming dogs in high-risk areas suggests that unrestrained dogs could play an important role in spreading ticks and pathogens. As means to limit RMSF risk, practical changes could include increased efforts for spay-neuter and policies encouraging dog restraint to limit canine roaming and spread of ticks across communities; due to dog density is less impactful such policies may be more useful than restrictions on the number of owned dogs."

          "abstract": "Sierra Mixe maize is a landrace variety from Oaxaca, Mexico, that utilizes nitrogen derived from the atmosphere via an undefined nitrogen fixation mechanism. The diazotrophic microbiota associated with the plant's mucilaginous aerial root exudate composed of complex carbohydrates was previously identified and characterized by our group where we found 23 lactococci capable of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) without containing any of the proposed essential genes for this trait (nifHDKENB). To determine the genes in Lactococcus associated with this phenotype, we selected 70 lactococci from the dairy industry that are not known to be diazotrophic to conduct a comparative population genomic analysis. This showed that the diazotrophic lactococcal genomes were distinctly different from the dairy isolates. Examining the pangenome followed by genome-wide association study and machine learning identified genes with the functions needed for BNF in the maize isolates that were absent from the dairy isolates. Many of the putative genes received an 'unknown' annotation, which led to the domain analysis of the 135 homologs. This revealed genes with molecular functions needed for BNF, including mucilage carbohydrate catabolism, glycan-mediated host adhesion, iron/siderophore utilization, and oxidation/reduction control. This is the first report of this pathway in this organism to underpin BNF. Consequently, we proposed a model needed for BNF in lactococci that plausibly accounts for BNF in the absence of the nif operon in this organism."

We show that publicly available data on human mobility-collected by Google, Facebook, and other providers-can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and forecast the spread of COVID-19. This approach uses simple and transparent statistical models to estimate the effect of NPIs on mobility, and basic machine learning methods to generate 10-day forecasts of COVID-19 cases. An advantage of the approach is that it involves minimal assumptions about disease dynamics, and requires only publicly-available data. We evaluate this approach using local and regional data from China, France, Italy, South Korea, and the United States, as well as national data from 80 countries around the world. We find that NPIs are associated with significant reductions in human mobility, and that changes in mobility can be used to forecast COVID-19 infections."

          "abstract": "BackgroundReasons for the highly variable and often poor protection conferred by the Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Gu\u00c3\u00a9rin (BCG) vaccine are multifaceted and poorly understood.ObjectivesWe aimed to determine whether early-life exposure to PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene] reduces 6-month infant BCG vaccine response.MethodsData came from families participating in a prospective birth cohort in eastern Slovakia. At birth, maternal and cord blood were collected for chemical analyses, and infants were immunized with BCG. Blood was collected from infants for chemical analyses and to determine 6-month BCG-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA levels. Multivariable linear regression models were fit to examine chemical-BCG associations among approximately 500 mother-infant pairs, with adjustment for confounders.ResultsThe median 6-month infant concentration of the prevalent congener PCB-153 was 113 ng/g lipid [interquartile range (IQR): 37-248], and 388 ng/g lipid (IQR: 115-847) for DDE. Higher 6-month infant concentrations of PCB-153 and DDE were strongly associated with lower 6-month BCG-specific antibody levels. For instance, BCG-specific IgG levels were 37% lower for infants with PCB-153 concentrations at the 75th percentile compared to the 25th percentile (95% CI: -42, -32; p < 0.001). Results were similar in magnitude and precision for DDE. There was also evidence of PCB-DDE additivity, where exposure to both compounds reduced anti-BCG levels more than exposure to either compound alone.ConclusionsThe associations observed in this study indicate that environmental exposures may be overlooked contributors to poorer responses to BCG vaccine. The overall association between these exposures and tuberculosis incidence is unknown.CitationJusko TA, De Roos AJ, Lee SY, Thevenet-Morrison K, Schwartz SM, Verner MA, Palkovicova Murinova L, Drobn\u00c3\u00a1 B, Ko\u00c4\u008dan A, Fabi\u00c5\u00a1ikov\u00c3\u00a1 A, \u00c4\u0152onka K, Trnovec T, Hertz-Picciotto I, Lawrence BP. 2016.

Discovering novel biomarkers for risk stratification of HCC is paramount. We examined biomarkers of the gut-liver axis in a prospective multicenter cohort.MethodsPatients with cirrhosis without a history of HCC were recruited between May 2015 and March 2020 and prospectively followed at 3 tertiary care hospitals in Los Angeles. Microbiome analysis was performed on duodenal biopsies and metabolomic analysis was performed on serum samples, collected at the time of enrollment. Optimal microbiome-based survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were used to determine microbiota and metabolite associations with HCC development, respectively.ResultsA total of 227 participants with liver cirrhosis contributed a total of 459.58 person-years of follow-up, with 14 incident HCC diagnoses.

Recent evidence suggests that maternal nutrition may affect the amount of HMOs and proteins in breast milk; however, the effect of nutrient supplementation on HMOs and bioactive proteins has not yet been well studied.ObjectiveWe aimed to determine whether lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) affect milk bioactive protein and HMO concentrations at 6 mo postpartum in women in rural Malawi. These are secondary outcomes of a previously published randomized controlled trial.MethodsWomen were randomly assigned to consume either an iron and folic acid capsule (IFA) daily from \u00e2\u2030\u00a420 wk gestation until delivery, followed by placebo daily from delivery to 6 mo postpartum, or a multiple micronutrient (MMN) capsule or LNS daily from \u00e2\u2030\u00a420 wk gestation to 6 mo postpartum. Breast milk concentrations of total HMOs, sialylated HMOs, fucosylated HMOs, lactoferrin, lactalbumin, lysozymes, antitrypsin, immunoglobulin A, and osteopontin were analyzed at 6 mo postpartum (n = 647). Between-group differences in concentrations and in proportions of women classified as having low concentrations were tested.ResultsHMO and bioactive protein concentrations did not differ between groups (P > 0.10 for all comparisons). At 6 mo postpartum, the proportions of women with low HMOs or bioactive proteins were not different between groups except for osteopontin. A lower proportion of women in the IFA group had low osteopontin compared with the LNS group after adjusting for covariates (OR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.9; P = 0.016).ConclusionThe study findings do not support the hypothesis that supplementation with an LNS or MMN capsule during pregnancy and postpartum would increase HMO or bioactive milk proteins at 6 mo postpartum among Malawian women. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01239693."

Here we sought to establish a model for the efficient manipulation and transformation of porcine mammary epithelial cells (pMEC) in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.MethodsWe utilized a vector encoding the red florescent protein tdTomato to transduce populations of pMEC from Yorkshire -Hampshire crossbred female pigs in vitro and in vivo. Populations of primary pMEC were then separated by FACS using markers to distinguish epithelial cells (CD140a-) from stromal cells (CD140a+), with or without further enrichment for basal and luminal progenitor cells (CD49f+). These separated pMEC populations were transduced by lentivirus encoding murine polyomavirus T antigens (Tag) and tdTomato and engrafted to orthotopic or ectopic sites in immunodeficient NOD.Cg-Prkdc (scid) Il2rg (tm1Wjl) /SzJ (NSG) mice.ResultsWe demonstrated that lentivirus effectively transduces pMEC in vitro and in vivo. We further established that lentivirus can be used for oncogenic-transformation of pMEC ex vivo for generating mammary tumors in vivo. Oncogenic transformation was confirmed in vitro by anchorage-independent growth, increased cell proliferation, and expression of CDKN2A, cyclin A2 and p53 alongside decreased phosphorylation of Rb. Moreover, Tag-transformed CD140a- and CD140a-CD49f\u00e2\u20ac\u2030+\u00e2\u20ac\u2030pMECs developed site-specific tumors of differing histopathologies in vivo.ConclusionsHerein we establish a model for the transduction and oncogenic transformation of pMEC. This is the first report describing a porcine model of mammary epithelial cell tumorigenesis that can be applied to the study of human breast cancers."

To improve control efficiency and cost-effectiveness, some advocate eliminating or treating only highly productive containers. The population-level outcome of this strategy, however, will depend on details of Ae. aegypti oviposition behavior.Methodology/principal findingsWe simultaneously monitored female oviposition and juvenile development in 80 experimental containers located across 20 houses in Iquitos, Peru, to test the hypothesis that Ae. aegypti oviposit preferentially in sites with the greatest potential for maximizing offspring fitness. Females consistently laid more eggs in large vs. small containers (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01609.18, p<0.001), and in unmanaged vs. manually filled containers (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01605.33, p<0.001). Using microsatellites to track the development of immature Ae. aegypti, we found a negative correlation between oviposition preference and pupation probability (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u0160-3.37, p<0.001).

Inside a semi-field enclosure, we simulated a container elimination campaign targeting the most productive oviposition sites. Compared to the two post-intervention trials, egg batches were more clumped during the first pre-intervention trial (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u0160-0.17, P<0.001), but not the second (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01600.01, p\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01600.900). Overall, when preferred containers were unavailable, the probability that any given container received eggs increased (\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01601.36, p<0.001).Conclusions/significanceAe. aegypti oviposition site choice can contribute to population regulation by limiting the production and size of adults. Targeted larval control strategies may unintentionally lead to dispersion of eggs among suitable, but previously unoccupied or under-utilized containers. We recommend integrating targeted larval control measures with other strategies that leverage selective oviposition behavior, such as luring ovipositing females to gravid traps or egg sinks."

          "abstract": "Previous studies measuring the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of individuals with dengue focused on treatment seeking populations. However, the vast majority of global dengue cases are unlikely to be detected by health systems. Representative measurements of HRQoL should therefore include patients with disease not likely to trigger treatment-seeking behavior. This study based in Iquitos, Peru used the Quality of Wellbeing Scale-Self Administered, a survey that enquires about not only physical health, but also psychological health, self-care, mobility, and usual social activities, and rates HRQoL between 0 (death) and 1 (optimum function), to evaluate the impact of dengue on HRQoL. In order to enroll treatment and non treatment-seeking participants, three modalities of participant recruitment were used. In addition to clinic and community-based febrile surveillance, a contact-cluster methodology was also employed to identify infected individuals less likely to seek treatment. We measured changes in HRQoL and identified common areas of health impairment in 73 virologically confirmed dengue cases at 3 time points during the participant's illness; the early-acute (days 0-6 post symptom onset), late-acute (days 7-20), and convalescent illness phases (days 21 +). Participants reported HRQoL related impairments at significantly higher frequency during the early-acute versus convalescent illness phase (Fisher's exact: P<0.01). There was substantial heterogeneity in scores during each illness phase with median scores in the early-acute, late-acute and convalescent phases of 0.56 (IQR: 0.41-0.64), 0.70 (IQR: 0.57-0.94), and 1 (IQR: 0.80-1.00), respectively. In all illness phases participants recruited in clinics had on average the lowest HRQoL scores where as those recruited in the contact clusters had the highest. Only 1 individual who was recruited in the contact-clusters had no reduction in HRQoL score during their illness. These data illustrate that dengue should be considered as a disease that may have significant implications for not only physical health but also psychological health and social functioning. The impact of dengue on the HRQoL of non-treatment-seeking individuals, although lower than the impact among treatment-seeking individuals, is not necessarily trivial."

The most common causes of discordance as described by a sub-sample (n=101) with whom we followed-up were GPS units being accidentally off (30%), forgetting or purposely not taking the units when leaving home (24.8%), possible barriers to the signal (4.7%) and leaving units home to recharge (4.6%). We provide a quantitative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of both methods for capturing fine-scale human mobility."

          "abstract": "Previous studies measuring the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of individuals with dengue focused on treatment seeking populations. However, the vast majority of global dengue cases are unlikely to be detected by health systems. Representative measurements of HRQoL should therefore include patients with disease not likely to trigger treatment-seeking behavior. This study based in Iquitos, Peru used the Quality of Wellbeing Scale-Self Administered, a survey that enquires about not only physical health, but also psychological health, self-care, mobility, and usual social activities, and rates HRQoL between 0 (death) and 1 (optimum function), to evaluate the impact of dengue on HRQoL. In order to enroll treatment and non treatment-seeking participants, three modalities of participant recruitment were used. In addition to clinic and community-based febrile surveillance, a contact-cluster methodology was also employed to identify infected individuals less likely to seek treatment. We measured changes in HRQoL and identified common areas of health impairment in 73 virologically confirmed dengue cases at 3 time points during the participant's illness; the early-acute (days 0-6 post symptom onset), late-acute (days 7-20), and convalescent illness phases (days 21 +). Participants reported HRQoL related impairments at significantly higher frequency during the early-acute versus convalescent illness phase (Fisher's exact: P<0.01). There was substantial heterogeneity in scores during each illness phase with median scores in the early-acute, late-acute and convalescent phases of 0.56 (IQR: 0.41-0.64), 0.70 (IQR: 0.57-0.94), and 1 (IQR: 0.80-1.00), respectively. In all illness phases participants recruited in clinics had on average the lowest HRQoL scores where as those recruited in the contact clusters had the highest. Only 1 individual who was recruited in the contact-clusters had no reduction in HRQoL score during their illness. These data illustrate that dengue should be considered as a disease that may have significant implications for not only physical health but also psychological health and social functioning. The impact of dengue on the HRQoL of non-treatment-seeking individuals, although lower than the impact among treatment-seeking individuals, is not necessarily trivial."

          "abstract": "Current models of early human subsistence economies suggest a focus on large mammal hunting. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examine human bone stable isotope chemistry of 24 individuals from the early Holocene sites of Wilamaya Patjxa (9.0-8.7 cal. ka) and Soro Mikaya Patjxa (8.0-6.5 cal. ka) located at 3800 meters above sea level on the Andean Altiplano, Peru. Contrary to expectation, Bayesian mixing models based on the isotope chemistry reveal that plants dominated the diet, comprising 70-95% of the average diet. Paleoethnobotanical data further show that tubers may have been the most prominent subsistence resource. These findings update our understanding of earliest forager economies and the pathway to agricultural economies in the Andean highlands. The findings furthermore suggest that the initial subsistence economies of early human populations adapting to new landscapes may have been more plant oriented than current models suggest."

          "abstract": "In this study, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were modified to detect 3-PBA in plasma (including the adducted form) and urine among a large group of consumers and farmers in an agricultural area. The samples were collected on the same day in the morning from 100 consumers (50 females, 50 males) and 100 farmers (50 females, 50 males) in the Fang district, Chiang Mai province, northern Thailand. The ELISA was very sensitive having an IC50 value of 26.7 and 15.3 ng/mL, a limit of quantitation of 5 and 2.5 ng/mL and a limit of detection of 1.08 and 1.94 ng/mL for plasma and urine, respectively. These methods had low (< 5%) intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation. The extraction technique satisfactorily eliminated the matrix effect from samples before ELISA analysis, yielding good recoveries (85.9-99.4% and 87.3-98.0%, respectively). For the volunteer study, the detection rate for plasma 3-PBA was 24% in consumers and 42% in farmers, but the median and range values were similar (median 5.87 ng/mL, range 5.16-8.44 ng/mL in consumers and 6.27 ng/mL, range 4.29-9.57 ng/mL in farmers). The rate of detection in the urine was similar (76% and 69%, in consumers and in farmers), yet the median concentration was significantly higher in farmers (8.86 \u00ce\u00bcg/g creatinine in consumers vs 16.1 \u00ce\u00bcg/g creatinine in farmers) and the range also much wider in farmers (1.62-80.5 \u00ce\u00bcg/g creatinine in consumers and 0.80-256.2 \u00ce\u00bcg/g creatinine in farmers). There was no correlation between plasma 3-PBA and urinary 3-PBA concentrations in the study presumably because plasma 3-PBA is a measure of cumulative exposures while urinary 3-PBA reflects acute exposures. In addition, metabolism and excretion of pyrethroids varies by individual. Nevertheless, this study demonstrated that these volunteers were exposed to pyrethroids. To our knowledge, this is the first report that compared plasma 3-PBA and urinary 3-PBA in a large group of volunteers. The ELISA method provided higher sample throughput with lower cost as compared to the instrumental analysis."

The disease is characterized by distinct necrotic spots on leaves, stems and petioles that eventually expand and cause a dieback of apical tissues. Samples from symptomatic plants tested negative for infection by tomato spotted wilt virus, tobacco streak virus, tobacco etch virus and other known tomato-infecting viruses. A virus-like agent was sap-transmitted from diseased tissue to Nicotiana benthamiana and, when graft-transmitted to tomato, this agent induced chocolate spot symptoms. This virus-like agent also was sap-transmitted to Datura stramonium and Nicotiana glutinosa, but not to a range of non-solanaceous indicator plants. Icosahedral virions ~28\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30&nbsp;nm in diameter were purified from symptomatic N. benthamiana plants. When rub-inoculated onto leaves of N. benthamiana plants, these virions induced symptoms indistinguishable from those in N. benthamiana plants infected with the sap-transmissible virus associated with chocolate spot disease. Tomatoes inoculated with sap or grafted with shoots from N. benthamiana plants infected with purified virions developed typical chocolate spot symptoms, consistent with this virus being the causal agent of the disease. Analysis of nucleic acids associated with purified virions of the chocolate-spot-associated virus, revealed a genome composed of two single-stranded RNAs of ~7.5 and ~5.1&nbsp;kb. Sequence analysis of these RNAs revealed a genome organization similar to recently described torradoviruses, a new group of picorna-like viruses causing necrosis-associated diseases of tomatoes in Europe [tomato torrado virus (ToTV)] and Mexico [tomato apex necrosis virus (ToANV) and tomato marchitez virus (ToMarV)]. Thus, the ~7.5&nbsp;kb and ~5.1&nbsp;kb RNAs of the chocolate-spot-associated virus corresponded to the torradovirus RNA1 and RNA2, respectively; however, sequence comparisons revealed 64\u00e2\u20ac\u201c83% identities with RNA1 and RNA2 sequences of ToTV, ToANV and ToMarV.

Fresh milk samples (n\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u016032) were collected from four Holstein and Jersey cows at days 1, 15, 90 and 250 of lactation and free milk oligosaccharide profiles were analyzed. RNA was extracted from milk somatic cells at days 15 and 250 of lactation (n\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u016012) and gene expression analysis was conducted by RNA-Sequencing. A list was created of 121 glycosylation-related genes involved in oligosaccharide metabolism pathways in bovine by analyzing the oligosaccharide profiles and performing an extensive literature search. No significant differences were observed in either oligosaccharide profiles or expressions of glycosylation-related genes between Holstein and Jersey cows. The highest concentrations of free oligosaccharides were observed in the colostrum samples and a sharp decrease was observed in the concentration of free oligosaccharides on day 15, followed by progressive decrease on days 90 and 250. Ninety-two glycosylation-related genes were expressed in milk somatic cells.

Fresh milk samples (n\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u016032) were collected from four Holstein and Jersey cows at days 1, 15, 90 and 250 of lactation and free milk oligosaccharide profiles were analyzed. RNA was extracted from milk somatic cells at days 15 and 250 of lactation (n\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u016012) and gene expression analysis was conducted by RNA-Sequencing. A list was created of 121 glycosylation-related genes involved in oligosaccharide metabolism pathways in bovine by analyzing the oligosaccharide profiles and performing an extensive literature search. No significant differences were observed in either oligosaccharide profiles or expressions of glycosylation-related genes between Holstein and Jersey cows. The highest concentrations of free oligosaccharides were observed in the colostrum samples and a sharp decrease was observed in the concentration of free oligosaccharides on day 15, followed by progressive decrease on days 90 and 250. Ninety-two glycosylation-related genes were expressed in milk somatic cells. Most of these genes exhibited higher expression in day 250 samples indicating increases in net glycosylation-related metabolism in spite of decreases in free milk oligosaccharides in late lactation milk. Even though fucosylated free oligosaccharides were not identified, gene expression indicated the likely presence of fucosylated oligosaccharides in bovine milk.

          "abstract": "Exceptional exposures of progradational platform margin slopes of Albian age were mapped along a 5-km, near-continuous, dip-oriented transect in northern Mexico with the goal of producing an outcrop model for analogous Cretaceous reservoirs. The study area at the El Cedral is located along the western margin of the Devils River grainstone belt flanking the muddy, intrashelf Maverick Basin. Four relatively complete clinothems and portions of two adjacent clinothems are recognized in the Las Pilas Formation in the study area. The Las Pilas clinothems exhibit complex sigmoid-oblique geometries and have dimensions of 40-60 m of vertical relief, depositional dip angles of foreset beds ranging from 8 to 15\u00c2\u00b0, and dip-oriented lengths of 1-2 km. Internally, in foresets of clinothems, thick- to massively bedded, sigmoid- to oblique-shaped lenses exhibit overlapping, seaward-stepping patterns toward the southeast. The primary sediment fabrics of topset, foreset, and bottomset beds of the Las Pilas clinothems are grainstones and grain-rich packstones. Coated grains are the predominant grain type, with subordinate amounts of micritized mollusk fragments and intraclasts. Porosity is predominantly moldic, but primary interparticle porosity is common. These lime sands were winnowed, coated, and micritized along the high-energy topsets of clinoforms before being exported seaward toward the breakpoint, where they cascaded onto the steep frontal slopes as sporadic grain flows or mass flows. The master bounding surfaces that define the clinothems likely represent episodes of nondeposition and abandonment of the surface, perhaps occurring during shifts in the locus of deposition laterally along the shoal margin. The architecture and composition of the Las Pilas clinoforms provide observable data for comparison with analogous subsurface reservoirs in the Aptian Shuaiba Formation (Bu Hasa field) and Cenomanian Mishrif Formation (e.g., Umm Adalkh field) of the Arabian Gulf."

          "abstract": "Cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium (L.) Schott) is an exotic species from tropical America that is widely cultivated in Ethiopia for its edible cormels and leaves. There is a dearth of information on the genetic diversity of Ethiopian cocoyam. In order to evaluate and select cocoyam germplasm for breeding and conservation, genetic diversity of 100 Ethiopian cocoyam accessions (65 green- and 35 purple- cocoyam) were analyzed using 29 morphological traits (16 qualitative and 13 quantitative) and 12 SSR loci. Two classes of qualitative traits were observed. ANOVA revealed significant variation in 11 (84.6%) of the 13 studied quantitative traits. The SSR marker analysis showed high genetic diversity. A total of 36 alleles were detected with a range of 2 to 5 (average of 3.273) alleles per locus. The average observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) values across populations were 0.503 and 0.443, respectively. The analysis of molecular variance showed that the variation among populations, among individuals within populations, and within individuals explained 14%, 18%, and 68% of the total variation, respectively. Cluster analysis grouped the accessions irrespective of the collection sites. A dendrogram based on Nei's standard genetic distance grouped the green cocoyam accessions together while the purple cocoyam accessions occupied a separate position within the dendrogram. Significant variation in quantitative traits and the high level of genetic diversity revealed by the SSR markers suggest that diverse cocoyam accessions, probably with multiple lineage, were introduced multiple times, through multiple routes and probably by multiple agents, an hypothesis that needs futher testing and analyis. The crop, therefore, needs more research efforts commensurate with its economic and social values than it has been accorded thus far. Further study is recommended to clarify the taxonomic status of Ethiopian cocoyam accesions and to trace their evolutionary relationships with Xanthosoma species elsewhere."

Here we use a Gaussian mixture model to develop a parsimonious relationship between SIF from TROPOMI and GPP from flux towers across the conterminous United States (CONUS). The mixture model indicates the SIF-GPP relationship can be characterized by a linear model with two terms. We then estimate GPP across CONUS at 500\u00c4\u009d\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00afm spatial resolution over a 16\u00c4\u009d\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00afd moving window. We observe four extreme precipitation events that induce regional GPP anomalies: drought in western Texas, flooding in the midwestern US, drought in South Dakota, and drought in California. Taken together, these events account for 28\u00c4\u009d\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00af% of the year-to-year GPP differences across CONUS. Despite these large regional anomalies, we find that CONUS GPP varies by less than 4\u00c4\u009d\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00af% between 2018 and 2019."

Existing research provides insufficient evidence to support this belief, however, largely because of limitations in the data and methodologies that researchers have used. The research described moves beyond a simple test of correlations to an exploration of how urban form fits into a more comprehensive model of choices about pedestrian trips. First, a model for individual choices about pedestrian trips is proposed. Second, the results of a study of six neighborhoods in Austin, Texas, are presented. Data from a survey of residents in these neighborhoods support the proposed model and suggest that certain aspects of urban form can play an important role in encouraging walks to a destination but that the savings in travel from the substitution of walking for driving is likely to be small."

Using a mosquito surveillance program in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) and San Antonio, TX, from 2016 to 2018, we detected the presence of an insect-specific virus, cell fusing agent virus (CFAV), in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population. We tested 6,326 females and 1,249 males from the LRGV and 659 females from San Antonio for CFAV by RT-PCR using specific primers. Infection rates varied from 0 to 261 per 1,000 mosquitoes in the LRGV and 115 to 208 per 1,000 in San Antonio depending on the month of collection. Infection rates per 1,000 individuals appeared higher in females collected from BG Sentinel 2 traps compared to Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps, but the ratio of the percentage of infected pools did not differ by trap type. The natural viral load in individual males ranged from 1.25 x 102 to 5.50 x 106 RNA copies and in unfed females from 5.42 x 103 to 8.70 x 106 RNA copies. Gravid females were found to harbor fewer viral particles than males and unfed females."

          "abstract": "Nomenclatural type definitions are one of the most important concepts in biological nomenclature. Being physical objects that can be re-studied by other researchers, types permanently link taxonomy (an artificial agreement to classify biological diversity) with nomenclature (an artificial agreement to name biological diversity). Two proposals to amend the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), allowing DNA sequences alone (of any region and extent) to serve as types of taxon names for voucherless fungi (mainly putative taxa from environmental DNA sequences), have been submitted to be voted on at the 11th International Mycological Congress (Puerto Rico, July 2018). We consider various genetic processes affecting the distribution of alleles among taxa and find that alleles may not consistently and uniquely represent the species within which they are contained. Should the proposals be accepted, the meaning of nomenclatural types would change in a fundamental way from physical objects as sources of data to the data themselves. Such changes are conducive to irreproducible science, the potential typification on artefactual data, and massive creation of names with low information content, ultimately causing nomenclatural instability and unnecessary work for future researchers that would stall future explorations of fungal diversity. We conclude that the acceptance of DNA sequences alone as types of names of taxa, under the terms used in the current proposals, is unnecessary and would not solve the problem of naming putative taxa known only from DNA sequences in a scientifically defensible way. As an alternative, we highlight the use of formulas for naming putative taxa (candidate taxa) that do not require any modification of the ICN."

          "abstract": "Chlorpyrifos (CPF) and profenofos (PFF) are organophosphorus (OP) insecticides that are applied seasonally in Egypt to cotton fields. Urinary trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy), a specific CPF metabolite, and 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol (BCP), a specific PFF metabolite, are biomarkers of exposure, while inhibition of blood butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities are effect biomarkers that may be associated with neurotoxicity. Urinary TCPy and BCP and blood BChE and AChE activities were measured in 37 adult Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture workers during and after 9-17 consecutive days of CPF application followed by an application of PFF (9-11 days), and a second CPF application (5 days) in 2008. During the OP applications, urinary TCPy and BCP levels were significantly higher than baseline levels, remained elevated following the application periods, and were associated with an exposure related inhibition of blood BChE and AChE. Analysis of blood AChE levels before and after the PFF application period suggests that individual workers with peak BCP levels greater than 1000 \u00ce\u00bcg/g creatinine exhibited further inhibition of blood AChE with PFF application, demonstrating that PFF exposure had a negative impact on AChE activity in this highly exposed worker population. While large interindividual differences in exposure were observed throughout this longitudinal study (peak urinary BCP and peak TCPy levels for individuals ranging from 13.4 to 8052 and 16.4 to 30,107 \u00ce\u00bcg/g creatinine, respectively), these urinary biomarkers were highly correlated within workers (r=0.75, p<0.001). This suggests that the relative exposures to CPF and PFF were highly correlated for a given worker. The variable exposures between job classification and work site suggest that job title and work location should not be used as the sole basis for categorizing OP exposures when assessing neurobehavioral and other health outcomes in Egyptian cotton field workers. Together, these findings will be important in educating the Egyptian insecticide application workers in order to encourage the development and implementation of work practices and personal protective equipment to reduce their exposure to CPF and PFF."

          "abstract": "In recent years, transportation planners have devoted more attention to the goal of increasing the non-motorized trips of children and adults. Non-motorized trips are considered important as a mean of reducing motorized trips as well increasing physical activity. Indeed, lack of physical activity has been identified as a major public health problem for both adults and younger people (Center of Disease control (CDC), 2005; Sallis, et al., 2004). A CDC report from 2002, for example, reports that about a third of the teenagers are not physically active enough (CDC, 2002). The lack of physical activity among children is, in part, associated with travel behavior and urban form (Ewing et al, 2003, Handy et al, 2002; Martin-Diener et al, 2005): children living in auto-oriented areas in the U.S. use walking and biking as modes of transportation to nearby destinations to a limited extent and less than in the past (Sallis et al, 1993; Sallis et al 2000). Their high level of auto use is, of course, tied to a high level of auto use among their parents, particularly their mothers (McMillan, 2007).For children, much discussion has focused on the journey to school, though researchers are now addressing non-school travel as well. According to McDonald (2006), who studied children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travel patterns based on the National Household Travel Survey, only 12% of the trips to sport activities are made by bike. The NHTS data do not allow a full estimate of non-motorized trips taken alone, versus trips taken with a parent, but it is reasonable to assume that use of bikes is even lower when parents are involved in the trip. Copperman and Bhat (2007) analyzed the determinants of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekend physical activity participation using data from the 2000 Bay Area travel survey. Their models correlate socio-demographic and land use variables with active and passive travel (i.e. non-motorized and motorized) and with physically active and passive activities. Their findings suggest that children (ages 5 to 17) rarely use non-motorized modes to get to places where they engage in physical activities, and that individual and household demographics, along with environmental factors, affect the level of physical activity.One place where children might be expected to use non-motorized modes to get to after-school activities is Davis, CA, well-known as a bicycle-friendly community. In Fall 2006, the Davis chapter of the American Youth Soccer Organization (Davis AYSO) set out to increase bicycling to soccer games through a two-pronged approach. First, the organization adopted a new approach to scheduling games, spreading them to fields throughout Davis rather than scheduling as many games as possible at three centralized fields. For most games, at least one team (and often both) was scheduled for a field within their neighborhood. In addition, Davis AYSO undertook a promotional program to encourage families to bike to games, including distribution of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bike to AYSO\u00e2\u20ac\u009d bike stickers, the creation of a special web site that included a Davis Bike Map, and e-mail announcements to almost all families about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bike to AYSO\u00e2\u20ac\u009d effort.

Here we characterize the lesions of infectious bronchitis (IB) and IBV prevalence and identify the circulating strains in small flocks in California. Backyard chickens (BYCs) submitted to the Davis (Northern California; NorCal) and San Bernardino (Southern California; SoCal) branches of the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System from January through March 2019 were included in the study. Trachea, kidney, and cecal tonsils were collected for real-time reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and sequence analysis. A total of 50 chickens out of 169 submissions tested positive for IBV by qRT-PCR. Of these, 16% (20/123) were from NorCal and 65% (30/46) from SoCal laboratory. The cecal tonsil was the most frequently positive tissue by qRT-PCR and IHC. Lymphoplasmacytic tracheitis was the most frequent histopathologic finding in 24 of 39 birds, while the kidney showed interstitial nephritis, tubular necrosis, tubular dilation, and/or gout in 14 of 43 chickens. Infectious bronchitis virus played a primary role or a synergistic effect in the mortality of chickens that succumbed to other infectious diseases. The sequences of IBV detected in 22 birds were analyzed, and 14 strains were most similar to CA1737. One strain each matched Conn46, Cal99, and ArkDPI, and the remaining five did not have a substantial match to any available reference strains. The findings in this study indicate that small flocks can be reservoirs of IBV and might facilitate evolution of new variants as well as reversion of attenuated strains to virulence."

In this study, we explored how our understanding of hydrologic flow pathways can be improved and expanded in both space and time by the simultaneous application of engineered synthetic DNA tracers. In this study, we compared the advective-dispersive transport properties and mass recovery rates of two types of synthetic DNA tracers, one consisting of synthetic DNA strands encapsulated into biodegradable microspheres and another consisting of 'free' DNA, i.e. not encapsulated. The DNA tracers were also compared with a conservative fluorescent dye. All tracers were injected into a small (3.2-km2) valley glacier, Storglaci\u00c3\u00a4ren, in northern Sweden. Seven of the nine DNA tracers showed clear recovery during the sampling period and similar peak arrival times and dispersion coefficients as the conservative fluorescent dye. However, recovered DNA tracer mass ranged only from 1% to 66%, while recovered fluorescent dye mass was 99%. Resulting from the cold and opaque subglacial environment provided by the glacier, mass loss associated with microbial activity and photochemical degradation of the DNA is likely negligible, leaving sorption of DNA tracers onto suspended particles and loss of microtracer particles to sediment storage as probable explanations. Despite the difference in mass recovery, the advection and dispersion information derived from the DNA tracer breakthrough curves provided spatially explicit information that allowed inferring a theoretical model of the flow pathways that water takes through the glacier."

Glycine tomentella Hayata (2n = 78), native to Australia, is a perennial relative in the tertiary gene pool of soybean. No effort has been devoted to using this species to increase seed yield. The objectives of this research were (i) to identify high-yielding lines derived from backcrosses between the soybean cultivar Dwight (2n = 40) and G. tomentella PI 441001 (2n = 78) and to compare their agronomic performance with that of the recurrent parent, and (ii) to determine associations between G. tomentella introgressions and agronomic traits. PI 441001 was crossed to Dwight and immature seed rescue was used to produce a sterile F1 plant. Amphidiploid plants (2n = 118) were produced by treating the F1 hybrid with colchicine. Amphidiploid plants were backcrossed to Dwight and a series of backcrosses were made to obtain lines with 2n = 40 chromosomes, which were self-fertile and genetically stable. Preliminary yield testing was used to select 180 lines in maturity groups II, III, and IV that had yields greater than or less than that of the recurrent parent. Yield data collected in two replication tests at six to eight locations in 2013 and 2014 identified experimental lines in all three maturity groups that were higher yielding than the recurrent parent. All experimental and parental lines were genotyped, revealing an average of 1% G. tomentella introgression. Significant associations were detected between G. tomentella introgressions and time of flowering, height, lodging, and yield."

A nested case-control study with 744 incident AMI cases and 744 matched controls aged 47-83 years was conducted within the Singapore Chinese Health Study. Nineteen plasma FAs and 12 oxylipins were quantified using MS. These were grouped into 12 FA clusters and 5 oxylipin clusters using hierarchical clustering, and their associations with AMI risk were assessed. Long-chain n-3 FAs [odds ratio (OR) = 0.67 per SD increase, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53-0.84, P < 0.001] and stearic acid (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.44-0.97, P = 0.03) were inversely associated with AMI risk, whereas arachidonic acid (AA) was positively associated with AMI risk (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.03-1.52, P = 0.02) in the multivariable model with adjustment for other FAs. Further adjustment for oxylipins did not substantially change these associations. An inverse association was observed between AA-derived oxylipin, thromboxane (TX)B2, and AMI risk (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.93, P = 0.003). Circulating long-chain n-3 FAs and stearic acid were associated with a lower and AA was associated with a higher AMI risk in this Chinese population. The association between the oxylipin TXB2 and AMI requires further research."

Here we evaluate the first two years of lease market activity and participation.  We find the program may provide beneficial flexibility to some commercial quota holders, with the number of transfers to the charter sector being greater than transfers within the commercial sector for some types of commercial quota. We also identify a high proportion of self-leasers. However, transfers to the charter sector are on average smaller than within-sector commercial transfers, and total poundage leased by the charter sector is low compared to commercial transfers. Finally, the value-per-pound may be higher in the charter sector, as commercial-to-charter transfer prices approach the commercial ex-vessel price."

Risk of S. neurona exposure in sea otters is associated with consumption of clams and soft-sediment prey and is temporally associated with runoff events. We examined the spatial distribution of S. neurona exposure risk based on serum antibody testing and assessed risk factors for exposure in animals from California, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska. Significant spatial clustering of seropositive animals was observed in California and Washington, compared with British Columbia and Alaska. Adult males were at greatest risk for exposure to S. neurona, and there were strong associations with terrestrial features (wetlands, cropland, high human housing-unit density). In California, habitats containing soft sediment exhibited greater risk than hard substrate or kelp beds. Consuming a diet rich in clams was also associated with increased exposure risk. These findings suggest a transmission pathway analogous to that described for Toxoplasma gondii, with infectious stages traveling in freshwater runoff and being concentrated in particular locations by marine habitat features, ocean physical processes, and invertebrate bioconcentration."

          "abstract": "Anthrax toxin receptor-mediated drug development for blocking anthrax toxin action has received much attention in recent decades. In this study, we produced a secreted anthrax decoy fusion protein comprised of a portion of the human capillary morphogenesis gene-2 (CMG2) protein fused via a linker to the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of human immunoglobulin G1 in Nicotiana benthamiana plants using a transient expression system. Using the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and co-expression with the p19 gene silencing suppressor, we were able to achieve a high level of recombinant CMG2-Fc-Apo (rCMG2-Fc-Apo) protein accumulation. Production kinetics were observed up to eight days post-infiltration, and maximum production of 826 mg/kg fresh leaf weight was observed on day six. Protein A affinity chromatography purification of the rCMG2-Fc-Apo protein from whole leaf extract and apoplast wash fluid showed the homodimeric form under non-reducing gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the molecular integrity of the secreted protein. The N-glycosylation pattern of purified rCMG2-Fc-Apo protein was analysed; the major portion of N-glycans consists of complex type structures in both protein samples. The most abundant (>50%) N-glycan structure was GlcNAc\u00e2\u201a\u201a(Xyl)Man\u00e2\u201a\u0192(Fuc)GlcNAc\u00e2\u201a\u201a in rCMG2-Fc-Apo recovered from whole leaf extract and apoplast wash fluid. High mannose N-glycan structures were not detected in the apoplast wash fluid preparation, which confirmed the protein secretion. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that high-level production of rCMG2-Fc-Apo can be achieved by transient production in Nicotiana benthamiana plants with apoplast targeting."

Comparing costs between healthcare systems can inform evaluation, development or modification of cancer care policies.ObjectivesTo estimate and compare cancer costs in British Columbia and Ontario from the payers' perspectives.MethodsUsing linked cancer registry and administrative data, and standardized costing methodology and analyses, we estimated costs for 21 cancer sites by phase of care to determine potential differences between provinces.ResultsOverall, costs were higher in Ontario. Costs were highest in the initial post-diagnosis and pre-death phases and lowest in the pre-diagnosis and continuing phases, and generally higher for brain cancer and multiple myeloma, and lower for melanoma. Hospitalization was the major cost category. Costs for physician services and diagnostic tests differed the most between provinces.ConclusionsThe standardization of data and costing methodology is challenging, but it enables interprovincial and international comparative costing analyses."

          "abstract": "Human babesiosis is a life-threatening infectious disease that causes societal and economic impact worldwide. Several species of Babesia cause babesiosis in terrestrial vertebrates, including humans. A one-day clinic was held in Ontario, Canada, to see if a red blood cell parasite, which is present in blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, is present in humans. Based on PCR testing and DNA sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene, we unveiled B. odocoilei in two of 19 participants. DNA amplicons from these two patients are almost identical matches with the type strains of B. odocoilei in GenBank. In addition, the same two human subjects had the hallmark symptoms of human babesiosis, including night sweats, chills, fevers, and profound fatigue. Based on symptoms and molecular identification, we provide substantive evidence that B. odocoilei is pathogenic to humans. Dataset reveals that B. odocoilei serologically cross-reacts with Babesia duncani. Clinicians must realize that there are more than two Babesia spp. in North America that cause human babesiosis. This discovery signifies the first report of B. odocoilei causing human babesiosis."

          "abstract": "Xylella fastidiosa colonizes the xylem of various cultivated and native plants worldwide. Citrus production in Brazil has been seriously affected, and major commercial varieties remain susceptible to Citrus Variegated Chlorosis (CVC). Collective cellular behaviors such as biofilm formation influence virulence and insect transmission of X. fastidiosa. The reference strain 9a5c produces a robust biofilm compared to Fb7 that remains mostly planktonic, and both were isolated from symptomatic citrus trees. This work deepens our understanding of these distinct behaviors at the molecular level, by comparing the cellular and secreted proteomes of these two CVC strains. Out of 1017 identified proteins, 128 showed differential abundance between the two strains. Different protein families were represented such as proteases, hemolysin-like proteins, and lipase/esterases, among others. Here we show that the lipase/esterase LesA is among the most abundant secreted proteins of CVC strains as well, and demonstrate its functionality by complementary activity assays. More severe symptoms were observed in Nicotiana tabacum inoculated with strain Fb7 compared to 9a5c. Our results support that systemic symptom development can be accelerated by strains that invest less in biofilm formation and more in plant colonization. This has potential application in modulating the bacterial-plant interaction and reducing disease severity."

The number of eligible professionals attesting was determined using the attestation data for each year and stage of the program. The proportion of attestations by EHR vendor was calculated using all attestations for each vendor.Main outcome measuresNumbers of ophthalmologists attesting by year and stage of the Medicare EHR Incentive Program, incentive payments, and number of attestations by EHR vendor.ResultsIn the peak year of participation, 51.6% of ophthalmologists successfully attested to MU, compared with 37.1% of optometrists, 50.2% of dermatologists, 54.5% of otolaryngologists, and 64.4% of urologists.

Traditional techniques for detecting and quantifying toxic metals in the atmosphere are either not real time, hindering identification of sources, or limited by instrument costs. Spark emission spectroscopy is a promising and cost-effective technique that can be used for analyzing toxic metals in real time. Here, we have developed a cost-effective spark emission spectroscopy system to quantify the concentration of toxic metals targeted by the US EPA. Specifically, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb solutions were diluted and deposited on the ground electrode of the spark emission system. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was optimized and employed to detect useful features from the spark-generated plasma emissions. The optimized model was able to detect atomic emission lines along with other features to build a regression model that predicts the concentration of toxic metals from the observed spectra. The limits of detections (LODs) were estimated using the detected features and compared to the traditional single-feature approach. LASSO is capable of detecting highly sensitive features in the input spectrum; however, for some toxic metals the single-feature LOD marginally outperforms LASSO LOD. The combination of low-cost instruments with advanced machine learning techniques for data analysis could pave the path forward for data-driven solutions to costly measurements."

          "abstract": "BackgroundThe application of otolith-based tools to inform the management and conservation of fishes first requires taxon- and stage-specific validation. The Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), a critically endangered estuarine fish that is endemic to the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE), California, United States, serves as a key indicator species in the SFE; thus, understanding this species' vital rates and population dynamics is valuable for assessing the overall health of the estuary. Otolith-based tools have been developed and applied across multiple life stages of Delta Smelt to reconstruct age structure, growth, phenology, and migration. However, key methodological assumptions have yet to be validated, thus limiting confidence in otolith-derived metrics that are important for informing major water management decisions in the SFE.MethodsUsing known-age cultured Delta Smelt and multiple independent otolith analysts, we examined otolith formation, otolith-somatic proportionality, aging accuracy and precision, left-right symmetry, and the effects of image magnification for larval, juvenile, and adult Delta Smelt.ResultsOverall, otolith size varied linearly with fish size (from 10-60 mm), explaining 99% of the variation in fish length, despite a unique slope for larvae < 10 mm. Otolith-somatic proportionality was similar among wild and cultured specimens. Aging precision among independent analysts was 98% and aging accuracy relative to known ages was 96%, with age estimates exhibiting negligible differences among left and right otoliths. Though error generally increased with age, percent error decreased from 0-30 days-post-hatch, with precision remaining relatively high (\u00e2\u2030\u00a5 95%) thereafter. Increased magnification (400\u00c3\u2014) further improved aging accuracy for the oldest, slowest-growing individuals. Together, these results indicate that otolith-based techniques provide reliable age and growth reconstructions for larval, juvenile, and adult Delta Smelt. Such experimental assessments across multiple developmental stages are key steps toward assessing confidence in otolith-derived metrics that are often used to assess the dynamics of wild fish populations."

Here we use a Gaussian mixture model to develop a parsimonious relationship between SIF from TROPOMI and GPP from flux towers across the conterminous United States (CONUS). The mixture model indicates the SIF-GPP relationship can be characterized by a linear model with two terms. We then estimate GPP across CONUS at 500\u00c4\u009d\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00afm spatial resolution over a 16\u00c4\u009d\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00afd moving window.

          "abstract": "BackgroundEelgrass (Zostera marina) is a marine angiosperm and foundation species that plays an important ecological role in primary production, food web support, and elemental cycling in coastal ecosystems. As with other plants, the microbial communities living in, on, and near eelgrass are thought to be intimately connected to the ecology and biology of eelgrass. Here we characterized the microbial communities in eelgrass sediments throughout an experiment to quantify the rate of ammonification, the first step in early remineralization of organic matter, also known as diagenesis, from plots at a field site in Bodega Bay, CA.MethodsSediment was collected from 72 plots from a 15 month long field experiment in which eelgrass genotypic richness and relatedness were manipulated. In the laboratory, we placed sediment samples (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 per plot) under a N2 atmosphere, incubated them at in situ temperatures (15&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C) and sampled them initially and after 4, 7, 13, and 19 days to determine the ammonification rate. Comparative microbiome analysis using high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was performed on sediment samples taken initially and at seven, 13 and 19 days to characterize changes in the relative abundances of microbial taxa throughout ammonification.ResultsWithin-sample diversity of the sediment microbial communities across all plots decreased after the initial timepoint using both richness based (observed number of OTUs, Chao1) and richness and evenness based diversity metrics (Shannon, Inverse Simpson). Additionally, microbial community composition changed across the different timepoints. Many of the observed changes in relative abundance of taxonomic groups between timepoints appeared driven by sulfur cycling with observed decreases in predicted sulfur reducers (Desulfobacterales) and corresponding increases in predicted sulfide oxidizers (Thiotrichales). None of these changes in composition or richness were associated with variation in ammonification rates.DiscussionOur results showed that the microbiome of sediment from different plots followed similar successional patterns, which we infer to be due to changes related to sulfur metabolism. These large changes likely overwhelmed any potential changes in sediment microbiome related to ammonification rate. We found no relationship between eelgrass presence or genetic composition and the microbiome. This was likely due to our sampling of bulk sediments to measure ammonification rates rather than sampling microbes in sediment directly in contact with the plants and suggests that eelgrass influence on the sediment microbiome may be limited in spatial extent. More in-depth functional studies associated with eelgrass microbiome will be required in order to fully understand the implications of these microbial communities in broader host-plant and ecosystem functions (e.g., elemental cycling and eelgrass-microbe interactions)."

          "abstract": "Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 \u00c2\u00b0C/16 \u00c2\u00b0C and cool = 8 \u00c2\u00b0C/4 \u00c2\u00b0C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth-dormancy transition-including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange-within two provenances of white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests."

Findings from this study showed that an egg intervention improved linear growth by a length-for-age z score of 0.63.Objective: We aimed to test the efficacy of eggs introduced early in complementary feeding on plasma concentrations of biomarkers in choline pathways, vitamins B-12 and A, and essential fatty acids.Design: A randomized controlled trial, the Lulun (\"egg\" in Kichwa) Project, was conducted in a rural indigenous population of Ecuador. Infants aged 6-9 mo were randomly assigned to treatment (1 egg/d for 6 mo; n = 80) and control (no intervention; n = 83) groups. Socioeconomic data, anthropometric measures, and blood samples were collected at baseline and endline. Household visits were made weekly for morbidity surveillance. We tested vitamin B-12 plasma concentrations by using chemiluminescent competitive immunoassay and plasma concentrations of choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, retinol, essential fatty acids, methionine, dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) with the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.Results: Socioeconomic factors and biomarker concentrations were comparable at baseline. Of infants, 11.4% were vitamin B-12 deficient and 31.7% marginally deficient at baseline. In adjusted generalized linear regression modeling, the egg intervention increased plasma concentrations compared with control by the following effect sizes: choline, 0.35 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.57); betaine, 0.29 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.58); methionine, 0.31 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.60); docosahexaenoic acid, 0.43 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.73); DMA, 0.37 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.69); and TMAO, 0.33 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.58). No significant group differences were found for vitamin B-12, retinol, linoleic acid (LA), \u00ce\u00b1-linolenic acid (ALA), or ratios of betaine to choline and LA to ALA.Conclusion: The findings supported our hypothesis that early introduction of eggs significantly improved choline and other markers in its methyl group metabolism pathway.

Metribuzin was applied either post-emergence (POST) or pre-emergence (PRE) at 0, 0.35, 0.52 and 0.70 g a.i. ha-1. At each location three conventionally planted wheat cultivars were tested. In most cases weed control increased with metribuzin rate following a linear or curvilinear trend with an application rate of 0.5 kg ha-1 a.i. providing an acceptable level of control. PRE applied metribuzin resulted in better control of weeds at Ahvaz while POST treatments were more effective at Karaj with no differences between PRE and POST treatments at two other locations (Zabol and Gorgan). Wheat yields increased with metribuzin rate at two locations (Ahvaz and Zabol) or showed minor (Karaj) to no changes (Gorgan) across application rates. Wheat yields were higher in PRE treated plots than in POST at Ahvaz, but lower at Karaj and did not vary at Zabol (with one exception) or Gorgan. Wheat cultivars also varied in their responses to metribuzin application rate or timing. Finally, metribuzin could be applied at 0.5 kg ha-1 a.i.

          "abstract": "Abstract: \r\n\r\n               Background: WISDOM is a 100,000 healthy women preference-tolerant, pragmatic study comparing annual to personalized risk-based breast screening. The novelty of WISDOM personalized screening is the integration of previously validated genetic and clinical risk factors (age, family history, breast biopsy results, ethnicity, mammographic density) into a single risk assessment model that directs the starting age, timing, and frequency of screening. The goal of WISDOM is to determine if personalized screening, compared to annual screening, is as safe, less morbid, enables prevention, and is preferred by women. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02620852. \r\n\r\n               Methods: Women aged 40-74 years with no history of breast cancer or DCIS, and no previous double mastectomy can join the study online at wisdomstudy.org. Participants can elect randomization or self-select a study arm, and provide electronic consent and Release for Medical Information using DocuSign. For all participants, 5-year risk of developing breast cancer is calculated according to the Breast Cancer Screening Consortium (BCSC) model. Participants in the personalized arm undergo panel-based mutation testing, and their 5-year risk is calculated using the BCSC score combined with a Polygenic Risk Score (BCSC-PRS) that includes 75 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, increase to 229) known to increase breast cancer risk. SNPs and mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1, ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2) are assessed by saliva-based testing through Color Genomics. 5-year risk level thresholds are used to stratify for low-, moderate- and high risk. Risk stratification determines age to start, stop, and frequency of screening. \r\n\r\n               Enrollment: As of July 2018, the WISDOM study is open to all eligible women in California, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. To date, 23,329 eligible women have registered and 14,393 women have consented to participate in the trial. We analyzed 3,255 participants who have completed risk assessment in the personalized arm. The median age was 56 years. 82% were Caucasian, 1% African-American, and 6% Asian. 9% self-reported as Hispanic. We are partnering with health insurers and self-insured companies using coverage with evidence progression. To strengthen generalizability, we are expanding to other states. WISDOM enrollment will continue past 2019. \r\n\r\n               Feasibility: To evaluate the addition of PRS, we used paired statistical tests (McNemar) to compare the distributions of BCSC, and BCSC-PRS risk estimates around low-risk (<1.3%), and very-high risk (>6%) thresholds, the latter corresponding to 5-year risk of a BRCA mutation carrier. The median 5-year risk was 1.5% (IQR 1.0-2.1%) using the BCSC model, and 1.4% (IQR 0.8-2.5%) using the BCSC-PRS model. The BCSC-PRS model classified more women into the low (<1%) and very high (\u00e2\u2030\u00a56%) risk categories compared to the BCSC model (p < 0.001). \r\n\r\n               Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that incorporating genetic variants into a validated clinical model is feasible and impacts risk classification compared to a model without genetic risk factors. Results at 5 years will reveal if this classification improves healthcare value by reducing screen volumes and costs without jeopardizing outcomes. \r\n\r\n               Citation Format: Acerbi I, Shieh Y, Madlensky L, Tice J, Ziv E, Eklund M, Blanco A, DeRosa D, Tong B, Goodman D, Nassereddine L, Anderson N, Harvey H, Layton T, Park HL, Petruse A, Stewart S, Wernisch J, Risty L, Koenig B, Sarrafan S, Firouzian R, Kaplan C, Hiatt R, Parker BA, Wenger N, Lee V, Heditsian D, Brain S, Stover Fiscalini A, Borowsky AD, Anton-Culver H, Naeim A, Kaster A, Talley M, van 't Veer LJ, LaCroix A, Wisdom Study and Athena Breast Health Network Investigators and Advocate Partners, Esserman LJ.

          "abstract": "Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has previously been shown to strongly correlate with gross primary productivity (GPP); however this relationship has not yet been quantified for the recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Here we use a Gaussian mixture model to develop a parsimonious relationship between SIF from TROPOMI and GPP from flux towers across the conterminous United States (CONUS). The mixture model indicates the SIF-GPP relationship can be characterized by a linear model with two terms. We then estimate GPP across CONUS at 500\u00c4\u009d\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00afm spatial resolution over a 16\u00c4\u009d\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00afd moving window. We observe four extreme precipitation events that induce regional GPP anomalies: drought in western Texas, flooding in the midwestern US, drought in South Dakota, and drought in California. Taken together, these events account for 28\u00c4\u009d\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00af% of the year-to-year GPP differences across CONUS. Despite these large regional anomalies, we find that CONUS GPP varies by less than 4\u00c4\u009d\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00af% between 2018 and 2019."

          "abstract": "Stakeholder negotiation is an increasingly important policymaking tool. However, relatively little is understood about the relationship between the structure of the negotiating process and the effectiveness with which stakeholders can pursue their individual interests. We apply the Rausser-Simon multilateral bargaining model to a specific negotiation process involving water storage capacity and use in the upper Adour Basin in southwestern France. We focus on a coalition of three stakeholder groups with aligned but distinct interests. In addition to the standard indices of bargaining power-the distribution of political weights (\"access\") and players' utilities if an agreement is not reached, our analysis identifi es other less obvious sources of power. First, a coalition member may benefit when his access is reduced if the redistribution increases the access of another coalition member who has a more favorable \"strategic location.\" Second, the interests of the coalition as a whole will usually, but not always, be advanced if its members cede access to a \"spokesman\" representing their common interests. However, some members may be adversely affected. Third, restricting the extent to which coalition members can make proposals that further their own individual interests at the expense of other coalition members will usually, but not always, harm the coalition as a whole."

          "abstract": "Policymakers everywhere are working to determine the set of restrictions that will effectively contain the spread of COVID-19 without excessively stifling economic activity. We show that publicly available data on human mobility-collected by Google, Facebook, and other providers-can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and forecast the spread of COVID-19. This approach uses simple and transparent statistical models to estimate the effect of NPIs on mobility, and basic machine learning methods to generate 10-day forecasts of COVID-19 cases. An advantage of the approach is that it involves minimal assumptions about disease dynamics, and requires only publicly-available data. We evaluate this approach using local and regional data from China, France, Italy, South Korea, and the United States, as well as national data from 80 countries around the world. We find that NPIs are associated with significant reductions in human mobility, and that changes in mobility can be used to forecast COVID-19 infections."

After covariate adjustment, higher HbA1c was associated with accelerated 7-year global (b = -0.045; 95% CI -0.070; -0.021; in z score units) and executive cognitive decline and a higher prevalence of MCI (odds ratio 1.20; 95% CI 1.11; 1.29).ConclusionsElevated HbA1c levels were associated with 7-year executive cognitive decline and increased MCI risk among diverse middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals. Our findings indicate that poor glycemic control in midlife may pose significant risks for cognitive decline and MCI later in life among Hispanic/Latino individuals of diverse heritages."

          "abstract": "Nutrient loss reduction strategies have recently been developed in the U.S. Midwest to decrease the environmental footprint associated with nitrogen (N) fertilizer use. Although these strategies generally suggest decreasing N rates and shifting the timing of N application from fall to spring, the spatiotemporal impacts of these practices on maize yield and fertilizer N use efficiency (NUE, kg grain yield increase per kg N applied) have not been assessed at the watershed scale using crop simulation models. We simulated the effects of N fertilizer rate (0, 168, 190, 224 kg N ha-1) and application timing [fall-applied N (FN): 100% N applied on 1 December; spring-applied N (SN): 100% N applied 10 days before planting; split N: 66% N applied on 1 December + 34% N applied 10 days before planting] on maize grain yield (GY) across 3042 points in Illinois during 2011-2015 using the DSSAT-CERES-Maize model. When simulations were scaled up to the watershed level, results suggest that increases in average maize GY for SN compared to FN occurred in years with higher than average winter rainfall (2011, 2013), whereas yields were similar (+/- 4%) in 2012, 2014, and 2015. Accordingly, differences in NUE for SN compared to FN were small (0.0-1.4 kg GY/kg N) when cumulative winter rainfall was < 300 mm, but increased to 0.1-9.2 kg GY/kg N when winter rainfall was > 500 mm at both 168 kg N ha-1 and 224 kg N ha-1. The combined practice of reducing N fertilizer amounts from 224 kg N ha-1 to 190 kg N ha-1 and shifting from FN to SN resulted in a wide range of yield responses during 2011-2015, with the probability of increasing yields varying from <10% to >70% of simulation points within a watershed. Positive impacts on both GY and NUE occurred in only 60% of simulations for this scenario, highlighting the challenge of simultaneously improving yield and NUE with a 15% N rate reduction in this region."

          "abstract": "BackgroundWild crop relatives have been potentially subjected to stresses on an evolutionary time scale prior to domestication. Among these stresses, drought is one of the main factors limiting crop productivity and its impact is likely to increase under current scenarios of global climate change. We sought to determine to what extent wild common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) exhibited adaptation to drought stress, whether this potential adaptation is dependent on the climatic conditions of the location of origin of individual populations, and to what extent domesticated common bean reflects potential drought adaptation.MethodsAn extensive and diverse set of wild beans from across Mesoamerica, along with a set of reference Mesoamerican domesticated cultivars, were evaluated for root and shoot traits related to drought adaptation. A water deficit experiment was conducted by growing each genotype in a long transparent tube in greenhouse conditions so that root growth, in addition to shoot growth, could be monitored.ResultsPhenotypic and landscape genomic analyses, based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms, suggested that beans originating from central and north-west Mexico and Oaxaca, in the driest parts of their distribution, produced more biomass and were deeper-rooted. Nevertheless, deeper rooting was correlated with less root biomass production relative to total biomass. Compared with wild types, domesticated types showed a stronger reduction and delay in growth and development in response to drought stress. Specific genomic regions were associated with root depth, biomass productivity and drought response, some of which showed signals of selection and were previously related to productivity and drought tolerance.ConclusionsThe drought tolerance of wild beans consists in its stronger ability, compared with domesticated types, to continue growth in spite of water-limited conditions. This study is the first to relate bean response to drought to environment of origin for a diverse selection of wild beans. It provides information that needs to be corroborated in crosses between wild and domesticated beans to make it applicable to breeding programmes."

          "abstract": "Sierra Mixe maize is a landrace variety from Oaxaca, Mexico, that utilizes nitrogen derived from the atmosphere via an undefined nitrogen fixation mechanism. The diazotrophic microbiota associated with the plant's mucilaginous aerial root exudate composed of complex carbohydrates was previously identified and characterized by our group where we found 23 lactococci capable of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) without containing any of the proposed essential genes for this trait (nifHDKENB). To determine the genes in Lactococcus associated with this phenotype, we selected 70 lactococci from the dairy industry that are not known to be diazotrophic to conduct a comparative population genomic analysis. This showed that the diazotrophic lactococcal genomes were distinctly different from the dairy isolates. Examining the pangenome followed by genome-wide association study and machine learning identified genes with the functions needed for BNF in the maize isolates that were absent from the dairy isolates. Many of the putative genes received an 'unknown' annotation, which led to the domain analysis of the 135 homologs. This revealed genes with molecular functions needed for BNF, including mucilage carbohydrate catabolism, glycan-mediated host adhesion, iron/siderophore utilization, and oxidation/reduction control. This is the first report of this pathway in this organism to underpin BNF. Consequently, we proposed a model needed for BNF in lactococci that plausibly accounts for BNF in the absence of the nif operon in this organism."

          "abstract": "In much in the same way that the automobile disrupted horse and cart transportation in the 20th century, automated vehicles hold the potential to disrupt our current system of transportation in the 21st century. Experts predict that vehicles could be fully automated by as early as 2025 or as late as 2035. Methods are needed to help the public and private sector understand automated vehicle technologies and their system-level effects. First, we explore the effects of automated vehicles using the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activity-based travel demand model (MTC-ABM). The simulation is unique in that it articulates the size and direction of change on travel for a wide range of automated vehicles scenarios. Second, we simulate the effects of the introduction of an automated taxi service on conventional personal vehicle and transit travel in the San Francisco Bay Area region and use new research on the costs of automated vehicles to represent plausible per mile automated taxi fares. We use an integrated model for the San Francisco Bay Area that includes the MTC-ABM combined with the agent-based MATSim model customized for the region. This model set uses baseline travel demand data from the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official activity-based travel model and dynamically assigns vehicles on road and transit networks by the time of day. Third, we use the MTC-ABM and the MATSim dynamic assignment model to simulate different \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first\u00e2\u20ac\u009d mile transit access services, including ride-hailing (Uber and Lyft) and ridesharing (Uber Pool/Lyft Line and Via) with and without automated vehicles.

          "abstract": "BackgroundIn 2016, California updated its prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), adding two key features: automated proactive reports to prescribers and mandatory registration for prescribers and pharmacists. The effects of these changes on prescribing patterns have not yet been examined. We aimed to evaluate the joint effect of these two PDMP features on county-level prescribing practices in California.MethodsUsing county-level quarterly data from 2012 to 2017, we estimated the absolute change associated with the implementation of these two PDMP features in seven prescribing indicators in California versus a control group comprising counties in Florida and Washington: opioid prescription rate per 1000 residents; patients' mean daily opioid dosage in milligrams of morphine equivalents[MME]; prescribers' mean daily MME prescribed; prescribers' mean number of opioid prescriptions per day; percentage of patients getting >90 MME/day; percentage of days with overlapping prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines; multiple opioid provider episodes per 100,000 residents.ResultsProactive reports and mandatory registration were associated with a 7.7 MME decrease in patients' mean daily opioid dose (95 %CI: -11.4, -2.9); a 1.8 decrease in the percentage of patients prescribed high-dose opioids (95 %CI: -2.3, -0.9); and a 6.3 MME decrease in prescribers' mean daily dose prescribed (95 %CI: -10.0, -1.3).ConclusionsCalifornia's implementation of these two PDMP features was associated with decreases in the total quantity of opioid MMEs prescribed, and indicators of patients prescribed high-dose opioids compared to states that had PDMP's without these features. Rates of opioid prescribing and other high-risk prescribing patterns remained unchanged."

          "abstract": "Clinical research increasingly relies upon the availability of appropriate genetic materials; however, the proportion of biospecimens from racial/ethnic minority patients and healthy controls are underrepresented, which preclude equitable research across all patient groups for cancer treatment. National Cancer Institute-funded Community Network Program Centers in California, Florida, and New York collaborated with local community partners to conduct three independent formative research studies with diverse (African American, Asian American, Hispanic, and White) participants to explore their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about biobanking, and their experiences with the donation of biospecimens. Our findings demonstrated similarities in overall low knowledge and understanding about the use of biospecimens for research. This was exacerbated for non-English speakers. Racial and ethnic groups differed with regard to a number of factors that are obstacles for participation, e.g., continuing medical mistrust (African Americans), lack of benefit (Hispanics), apprehension about the physical toll of donating (Vietnamese), usage of biospecimen for research (Hmong and Chinese), and suspicion of exploitation by corporate entities (Whites). However, participants uniformly reported general interest and willingness to participate in biobanking for altruistic purposes, particularly to benefit future generations. This interest was framed with a strong admonition that donations should be accompanied by transparency about study sponsorship and ownership, distribution and use of biospecimens, and study information that fit participants' backgrounds and experiences. This cross-cultural regional analysis offers significant insights into the similarities and variations in opinions and perceptions about biobanking and the collection of biospecimens for use in cancer research."

This study documents the frequency of news coverage of ERPOs throughout 2018 and examines the narratives used by media outlets to describe this risk-based firearm policy.MethodsUsing a mixed-method descriptive design, we examine the frequency of national&nbsp;news media coverage of ERPO legislation in 2018, before and after the Parkland shooting, and analyze the content of news articles related to a sample of states that considered ERPO legislation after the shooting.ResultsWe find a sharp increase in the frequency of articles related to ERPOs following the Parkland shooting and smaller increases in coverage&nbsp;surrounding ERPO policy proposals and other public mass shootings that year. Nearly three-quarters of articles in our content analysis mentioned the Parkland shooting. The news media often mentioned or quoted politicians compared to other stakeholders, infrequently specified uses for ERPOs (e.g., prevention of mass violence, suicide, or other violence), and rarely included evidence on effectiveness of such policies. More than one-quarter of articles mentioned a mass shooting perpetrator by name, and one-third of articles used the term \"gun control.\"ConclusionsThis study describes the emerging public discourse, as informed by media messaging and framing, on ERPOs as states continue to debate and implement these risk-based firearm violence prevention policies."

We assessed treatment adherence in a phase 3 contraceptive trial comparing the MVP-R and nonoxynol-9 (N-9) spermicidal gel. \r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            METHODS:: \r\n\r\n            This randomized, open-label, non-inferiority study was conducted at 62 sites in the U.S. and Russia; all sites obtained IRB-approval and all subjects provided informed consent. The MVP-R (Amphora\u00c2\u00ae, formerly known as Acidform) and N-9 were provided in pre-filled, single-use applicators. Women were instructed to use 1 applicator immediately before or up to 1 hour before vaginal intercourse, and to reapply product if more than 1 hour elapsed and for additional intercourse within 1 hour. Subjects recorded product use and coital activity on a daily diary. \r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            RESULTS:: \r\n\r\n            The 3,324 enrollees included 1,665 MVP-R and 1,659 N-9 subjects. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms; characteristics of the overall Intent-to-Treat population included mean age 27.6\u00c2\u00b15.6 years, body mass index 27.8\u00c2\u00b18.0 kg/m2 (32.8% obese), 62.0% White, and 76.6% non-Hispanic. The study method was used as the only contraceptive method and used correctly in 85.6% of coital acts (85.9% MVP-R, 85.3% N-9). Overall, 61.5% of all subjects (63.0% MVP-R, 60.1% N-9) were adherent with the proper method use for \u00e2\u2030\u00a590% of coital acts. The most common reason for non-adherence was failure to reapply with additional acts of intercourse within 1 hour after application (390/2,935 [13.3%]). \r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            CONCLUSION:: \r\n\r\n            Most subjects used these on-demand, women-controlled products as directed. Adherence was similar between the two treatment groups."

The novelty of WISDOM personalized screening is the integration of previously validated genetic and clinical risk factors (age, family history, breast biopsy results, ethnicity, mammographic density) into a single risk assessment model that directs the starting age, timing, and frequency of screening. The goal of WISDOM is to determine if personalized screening, compared to annual screening, is as safe, less morbid, enables prevention, and is preferred by women. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02620852. \r\n\r\n               Methods: Women aged 40-74 years with no history of breast cancer or DCIS, and no previous double mastectomy can join the study online at wisdomstudy.org. Participants can elect randomization or self-select a study arm, and provide electronic consent and Release for Medical Information using DocuSign. For all participants, 5-year risk of developing breast cancer is calculated according to the Breast Cancer Screening Consortium (BCSC) model. Participants in the personalized arm undergo panel-based mutation testing, and their 5-year risk is calculated using the BCSC score combined with a Polygenic Risk Score (BCSC-PRS) that includes 75 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, increase to 229) known to increase breast cancer risk. SNPs and mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1, ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2) are assessed by saliva-based testing through Color Genomics. 5-year risk level thresholds are used to stratify for low-, moderate- and high risk. Risk stratification determines age to start, stop, and frequency of screening. \r\n\r\n               Enrollment: As of July 2018, the WISDOM study is open to all eligible women in California, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. To date, 23,329 eligible women have registered and 14,393 women have consented to participate in the trial. We analyzed 3,255 participants who have completed risk assessment in the personalized arm. The median age was 56 years. 82% were Caucasian, 1% African-American, and 6% Asian. 9% self-reported as Hispanic. We are partnering with health insurers and self-insured companies using coverage with evidence progression. To strengthen generalizability, we are expanding to other states. WISDOM enrollment will continue past 2019. \r\n\r\n               Feasibility: To evaluate the addition of PRS, we used paired statistical tests (McNemar) to compare the distributions of BCSC, and BCSC-PRS risk estimates around low-risk (<1.3%), and very-high risk (>6%) thresholds, the latter corresponding to 5-year risk of a BRCA mutation carrier. The median 5-year risk was 1.5% (IQR 1.0-2.1%) using the BCSC model, and 1.4% (IQR 0.8-2.5%) using the BCSC-PRS model. The BCSC-PRS model classified more women into the low (<1%) and very high (\u00e2\u2030\u00a56%) risk categories compared to the BCSC model (p < 0.001). \r\n\r\n               Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that incorporating genetic variants into a validated clinical model is feasible and impacts risk classification compared to a model without genetic risk factors.

We tested 6,326 females and 1,249 males from the LRGV and 659 females from San Antonio for CFAV by RT-PCR using specific primers. Infection rates varied from 0 to 261 per 1,000 mosquitoes in the LRGV and 115 to 208 per 1,000 in San Antonio depending on the month of collection. Infection rates per 1,000 individuals appeared higher in females collected from BG Sentinel 2 traps compared to Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps, but the ratio of the percentage of infected pools did not differ by trap type. The natural viral load in individual males ranged from 1.25 x 102 to 5.50 x 106 RNA copies and in unfed females from 5.42 x 103 to 8.70 x 106 RNA copies.

          "title": "Abstract OT2-08-01: Personalized breast cancer screening in a population based study: Women Informed to Screen Depending On Measures of risk (WISDOM)",
          "abstract": "Abstract: \r\n\r\n               Background: WISDOM is a 100,000 healthy women preference-tolerant, pragmatic study comparing annual to personalized risk-based breast screening. The novelty of WISDOM personalized screening is the integration of previously validated genetic and clinical risk factors (age, family history, breast biopsy results, ethnicity, mammographic density) into a single risk assessment model that directs the starting age, timing, and frequency of screening. The goal of WISDOM is to determine if personalized screening, compared to annual screening, is as safe, less morbid, enables prevention, and is preferred by women. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02620852. \r\n\r\n               Methods: Women aged 40-74 years with no history of breast cancer or DCIS, and no previous double mastectomy can join the study online at wisdomstudy.org. Participants can elect randomization or self-select a study arm, and provide electronic consent and Release for Medical Information using DocuSign. For all participants, 5-year risk of developing breast cancer is calculated according to the Breast Cancer Screening Consortium (BCSC) model. Participants in the personalized arm undergo panel-based mutation testing, and their 5-year risk is calculated using the BCSC score combined with a Polygenic Risk Score (BCSC-PRS) that includes 75 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, increase to 229) known to increase breast cancer risk. SNPs and mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1, ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2) are assessed by saliva-based testing through Color Genomics. 5-year risk level thresholds are used to stratify for low-, moderate- and high risk. Risk stratification determines age to start, stop, and frequency of screening. \r\n\r\n               Enrollment: As of July 2018, the WISDOM study is open to all eligible women in California, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. To date, 23,329 eligible women have registered and 14,393 women have consented to participate in the trial. We analyzed 3,255 participants who have completed risk assessment in the personalized arm. The median age was 56 years. 82% were Caucasian, 1% African-American, and 6% Asian. 9% self-reported as Hispanic. We are partnering with health insurers and self-insured companies using coverage with evidence progression. To strengthen generalizability, we are expanding to other states. WISDOM enrollment will continue past 2019. \r\n\r\n               Feasibility: To evaluate the addition of PRS, we used paired statistical tests (McNemar) to compare the distributions of BCSC, and BCSC-PRS risk estimates around low-risk (<1.3%), and very-high risk (>6%) thresholds, the latter corresponding to 5-year risk of a BRCA mutation carrier. The median 5-year risk was 1.5% (IQR 1.0-2.1%) using the BCSC model, and 1.4% (IQR 0.8-2.5%) using the BCSC-PRS model. The BCSC-PRS model classified more women into the low (<1%) and very high (\u00e2\u2030\u00a56%) risk categories compared to the BCSC model (p < 0.001). \r\n\r\n               Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that incorporating genetic variants into a validated clinical model is feasible and impacts risk classification compared to a model without genetic risk factors. Results at 5 years will reveal if this classification improves healthcare value by reducing screen volumes and costs without jeopardizing outcomes. \r\n\r\n               Citation Format: Acerbi I, Shieh Y, Madlensky L, Tice J, Ziv E, Eklund M, Blanco A, DeRosa D, Tong B, Goodman D, Nassereddine L, Anderson N, Harvey H, Layton T, Park HL, Petruse A, Stewart S, Wernisch J, Risty L, Koenig B, Sarrafan S, Firouzian R, Kaplan C, Hiatt R, Parker BA, Wenger N, Lee V, Heditsian D, Brain S, Stover Fiscalini A, Borowsky AD, Anton-Culver H, Naeim A, Kaster A, Talley M, van 't Veer LJ, LaCroix A, Wisdom Study and Athena Breast Health Network Investigators and Advocate Partners, Esserman LJ.

          "abstract": "Sarcocystis neurona was recognised as an important cause of mortality in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) after an outbreak in April 2004 and has since been detected in many marine mammal species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Risk of S. neurona exposure in sea otters is associated with consumption of clams and soft-sediment prey and is temporally associated with runoff events. We examined the spatial distribution of S. neurona exposure risk based on serum antibody testing and assessed risk factors for exposure in animals from California, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska. Significant spatial clustering of seropositive animals was observed in California and Washington, compared with British Columbia and Alaska. Adult males were at greatest risk for exposure to S. neurona, and there were strong associations with terrestrial features (wetlands, cropland, high human housing-unit density). In California, habitats containing soft sediment exhibited greater risk than hard substrate or kelp beds. Consuming a diet rich in clams was also associated with increased exposure risk. These findings suggest a transmission pathway analogous to that described for Toxoplasma gondii, with infectious stages traveling in freshwater runoff and being concentrated in particular locations by marine habitat features, ocean physical processes, and invertebrate bioconcentration."

          "abstract": "BackgroundIn 2016, California updated its prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), adding two key features: automated proactive reports to prescribers and mandatory registration for prescribers and pharmacists. The effects of these changes on prescribing patterns have not yet been examined. We aimed to evaluate the joint effect of these two PDMP features on county-level prescribing practices in California.MethodsUsing county-level quarterly data from 2012 to 2017, we estimated the absolute change associated with the implementation of these two PDMP features in seven prescribing indicators in California versus a control group comprising counties in Florida and Washington: opioid prescription rate per 1000 residents; patients' mean daily opioid dosage in milligrams of morphine equivalents[MME]; prescribers' mean daily MME prescribed; prescribers' mean number of opioid prescriptions per day; percentage of patients getting >90 MME/day; percentage of days with overlapping prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines; multiple opioid provider episodes per 100,000 residents.ResultsProactive reports and mandatory registration were associated with a 7.7 MME decrease in patients' mean daily opioid dose (95 %CI: -11.4, -2.9); a 1.8 decrease in the percentage of patients prescribed high-dose opioids (95 %CI: -2.3, -0.9); and a 6.3 MME decrease in prescribers' mean daily dose prescribed (95 %CI: -10.0, -1.3).ConclusionsCalifornia's implementation of these two PDMP features was associated with decreases in the total quantity of opioid MMEs prescribed, and indicators of patients prescribed high-dose opioids compared to states that had PDMP's without these features. Rates of opioid prescribing and other high-risk prescribing patterns remained unchanged."

          "abstract": "The release of the first reference genome of walnut (Juglans regia L.) enabled many achievements in the characterization of walnut genetic and functional variation. However, it is highly fragmented, preventing the integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic information to fully elucidate walnut biological processes. Here, we report the new chromosome-scale assembly of the walnut reference genome (Chandler v2.0) obtained by combining Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing with chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology. Relative to the previous reference genome, the new assembly features an 84.4-fold increase in N50 size, with the 16 chromosomal pseudomolecules assembled and representing 95% of its total length. Using full-length transcripts from single-molecule real-time sequencing, we predicted 37,554 gene models, with a mean gene length higher than the previous gene annotations. Most of the new protein-coding genes (90%) present both start and stop codons, which represents a significant improvement compared with Chandler v1.0 (only 48%). We then tested the potential impact of the new chromosome-level genome on different areas of walnut research. By studying the proteome changes occurring during male flower development, we observed that the virtual proteome obtained from Chandler v2.0 presents fewer artifacts than the previous reference genome, enabling the identification of a new potential pollen allergen in walnut. Also, the new chromosome-scale genome facilitates in-depth studies of intraspecies genetic diversity by revealing previously undetected autozygous regions in Chandler, likely resulting from inbreeding, and 195 genomic regions highly differentiated between Western and Eastern walnut cultivars. Overall, Chandler v2.0 will serve as a valuable resource to better understand and explore walnut biology."

          "abstract": "An outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) transmitted by the brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato) has emerged as a major human and animal health concern in Mexicali, Mexico. Due to high rates of brown dog tick infestation, susceptibility, and association with humans, dogs serve as sentinels and have a key role in the ecology of RMSF. A cross-sectional household questionnaire study was conducted in six rural and urban locations to characterize dog ecology and demography in RMSF high-and low-risk areas of Mexicali. In addition, we tracked movement patterns of 16 dogs using a GPS data logger. Of 253 households, 73% owned dogs, and dog ownership tended to be higher in high-risk areas, with a mean dog:human ratio of 0.43, compared with 0.3 in low-risk areas. Dogs in high-risk areas had higher fecundity and roamed more, but the dog density and numbers of free-roaming dogs were comparable. There was a higher proportion of younger dogs and lower proportion of older dogs in high-risk areas. The high proportion of immunologically na\u00c3\u00afve puppies in high risk areas could result in a lack of herd immunity leading to a more vulnerable dog and human population. The marked increase of space use of free-roaming dogs in high-risk areas suggests that unrestrained dogs could play an important role in spreading ticks and pathogens. As means to limit RMSF risk, practical changes could include increased efforts for spay-neuter and policies encouraging dog restraint to limit canine roaming and spread of ticks across communities; due to dog density is less impactful such policies may be more useful than restrictions on the number of owned dogs."

          "abstract": "High-yielding varieties developed in the 1960s and 1970s at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and elsewhere benefited farmers and the public, ultimately increasing yields and reducing the cost of rice to consumers. Most of these varieties, however, did not have the optimum cooking quality that was possessed by many of the traditional varieties they replaced. In 1985, the IRRI-developed indica variety IR64 was released in the Philippines. In addition to its high yield, early maturity and disease resistance, it had excellent cooking quality, matching that of the best varieties available. These merits resulted in its rapid spread and cultivation on over 10 million ha in the two decades after it was released. It has intermediate amylose content and gelatinization temperature, and good taste. It is resistant to blast and bacterial blight diseases, and to brown planthopper. Because of its success as a variety, it has been used extensively in scientific studies and has been well-characterized genetically. Many valuable genes have been introduced into IR64 through backcross breeding and it has been used in thousands of crosses. Its area of cultivation has declined in the past 10&nbsp;years, but it has been replaced by a new generation of high-quality varieties that are mostly its progeny or relatives. Continued basic studies on IR64 and related varieties should help in unraveling the complex genetic control of yield and other desirable traits that are prized by rice farmers and consumers."

For public health and vector control programs, it is helpful to know whether variation in risk of local transmission can be attributed to socio-demographic factors that could help to target surveillance and control programs. Socio-demographic factors have been shown to influence transmission risk of dengue virus outside the U.S. by modifying biting rates and vector abundance. In regions of the U.S. where Ae. aegypti have recently invaded and where residential areas are structured differently than those in the tropics where Ae. aegypti are endemic, it is unclear how socio-demographic factors modify the abundance of Ae. aegypti populations. Understanding heterogeneities among households in Ae. aegypti abundance will provide a better understanding of local vectorial capacity and is an important component of understanding risk of local Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Los Angeles County, California during summer 2017 to understand the causes of variation in relative abundance of Ae. aegypti among households. We surveyed 161 houses, representing a wide range of incomes. Surveys consisted of systematic adult mosquito collections, inspections of households and properties, and administration of a questionnaire in English or Spanish. Adult Ae. aegypti were detected at 72% of households overall and were found indoors at 12% of households. An average of 3.1 Ae. aegypti were collected per household. Ae. aegypti abundance outdoors was higher in lower-income neighborhoods and around older households with larger outdoor areas, greater densities of containers with standing water, less frequent yard maintenance, and greater air-conditioner use. We also found that Ae. aegypti abundance indoors was higher in households that had less window and door screening, less air-conditioner usage, more potted plants indoors, more rain-exposed containers around the home, and lower neighborhood human population densities. Our results indicate that, in the areas of southern California studied, there are behavioral and socio-demographic determinants of Ae. aegypti abundance, and that low-income households could be at higher risk for exposure to Ae. aegypti biting and potentially greater risk for Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus transmission if a local outbreak were to occur."

We conducted a longitudinal investigation of malaria vector host choice over 3&nbsp;years and resting behaviour over 4&nbsp;years following a mass long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) distribution in Tanzania. By pairing observations of mosquito ecology with environmental monitoring, we quantified longitudinal shifts in host-choice and resting behaviour that are consistent with adaptation to evade LLINs. The density of An. funestus s.l., declined significantly through time. In tandem, An. arabiensis and An. funestus s.l. exhibited an increased rate of outdoor relative to indoor resting; with An. arabiensis reducing the proportion of blood meals taken from humans in favour of cattle. By accounting for environmental variation, this study detected clear evidence of intra-specific shifts in mosquito behaviour that could be obscured in shorter-term or temporally-coarse surveys. This highlights the importance of mosquito behavioural adaptations to vector control, and the value of longer-term behavioural studies."

          "abstract": "The straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is a pteropodid whose conservation is crucial for maintaining functional connectivity of plant populations in tropical Africa. Land conversion has pushed this species to adapt to roosting in urban centers across its range. These colonies often host millions of individuals, creating intensive human-bat contact interfaces that could facilitate the spillover of coronaviruses shed by these bats. A better understanding of coronavirus dynamics in these roosts is needed to identify peak times of exposure risk in order to propose evidence-based management that supports safe human-bat coexistence, as well as the conservation of this chiropteran. We studied the temporal patterns of coronavirus shedding in E. helvum, by testing thousands of longitudinally-collected fecal samples from two spatially distant urban roosts in Ghana and Tanzania. Shedding of coronaviruses peaked during the second part of pup weaning in both roosts. Assuming that coronavirus shedding is directly related to spillover risk, our results indicate that exposure mitigation should target reducing contact between people and E. helvum roosts during the pup \"weaning\" period. This recommendation can be applied across the many highly-populated urban sites occupied by E. helvum across Africa."

          "abstract": "Cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium (L.) Schott) is an exotic species from tropical America that is widely cultivated in Ethiopia for its edible cormels and leaves. There is a dearth of information on the genetic diversity of Ethiopian cocoyam. In order to evaluate and select cocoyam germplasm for breeding and conservation, genetic diversity of 100 Ethiopian cocoyam accessions (65 green- and 35 purple- cocoyam) were analyzed using 29 morphological traits (16 qualitative and 13 quantitative) and 12 SSR loci. Two classes of qualitative traits were observed. ANOVA revealed significant variation in 11 (84.6%) of the 13 studied quantitative traits. The SSR marker analysis showed high genetic diversity. A total of 36 alleles were detected with a range of 2 to 5 (average of 3.273) alleles per locus. The average observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) values across populations were 0.503 and 0.443, respectively. The analysis of molecular variance showed that the variation among populations, among individuals within populations, and within individuals explained 14%, 18%, and 68% of the total variation, respectively. Cluster analysis grouped the accessions irrespective of the collection sites. A dendrogram based on Nei's standard genetic distance grouped the green cocoyam accessions together while the purple cocoyam accessions occupied a separate position within the dendrogram. Significant variation in quantitative traits and the high level of genetic diversity revealed by the SSR markers suggest that diverse cocoyam accessions, probably with multiple lineage, were introduced multiple times, through multiple routes and probably by multiple agents, an hypothesis that needs futher testing and analyis. The crop, therefore, needs more research efforts commensurate with its economic and social values than it has been accorded thus far. Further study is recommended to clarify the taxonomic status of Ethiopian cocoyam accesions and to trace their evolutionary relationships with Xanthosoma species elsewhere."

          "abstract": "PurposeOsteoarthritis (OA) is a frequently occurring, chronic condition; however, few studies describe the clinical characteristics of individuals with OA and the treatments they use to manage their symptoms. We conducted a study to characterize the OA population in the US and describe the nonsurgical management used by this population based on consumer research data collected through an online survey.MethodsData from the 2017 US National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) for adults aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a535 years were used to evaluate the relationship between OA and certain study participant characteristics and to identify the most commonly used treatment options. NHWS data were collected through a survey of individuals drawn from the internet panel maintained by Lightspeed Research (Bridgewater, New Jersey) and its panel partners. Weighted estimates were generated using data from the 2016 Current Population Survey (Annual Demographics File) of the US Census Bureau. Comparisons between the general and OA populations were made based on body mass index (BMI), exercise frequency, and comorbid diagnoses of hypertension or diabetes. Among the OA population, the use of dietary supplements, prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) treatments with chondroitin with or without glucosamine (Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl), prescription treatment by time since OA diagnosis, and utilization of a physical therapist were also recorded.ResultsThe prevalence of OA in the overall population was 17.6 % and was higher for individuals with a BMI \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 25 (21.9 %), patients diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes (36.2 %), and those who did not exercise regularly (19.0 %).

Individuals with OA using Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl primarily reported use of OTC products only or used them in combination with prescription products. The likelihood of using prescription products increased with the length of OA history.

          "abstract": "PurposeOsteoarthritis (OA) is a frequently occurring, chronic condition; however, few studies describe the clinical characteristics of individuals with OA and the treatments they use to manage their symptoms. We conducted a study to characterize the OA population in the US and describe the nonsurgical management used by this population based on consumer research data collected through an online survey.MethodsData from the 2017 US National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) for adults aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a535 years were used to evaluate the relationship between OA and certain study participant characteristics and to identify the most commonly used treatment options. NHWS data were collected through a survey of individuals drawn from the internet panel maintained by Lightspeed Research (Bridgewater, New Jersey) and its panel partners. Weighted estimates were generated using data from the 2016 Current Population Survey (Annual Demographics File) of the US Census Bureau. Comparisons between the general and OA populations were made based on body mass index (BMI), exercise frequency, and comorbid diagnoses of hypertension or diabetes. Among the OA population, the use of dietary supplements, prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) treatments with chondroitin with or without glucosamine (Ch \u00c2\u00b1 Gl), prescription treatment by time since OA diagnosis, and utilization of a physical therapist were also recorded.ResultsThe prevalence of OA in the overall population was 17.6 % and was higher for individuals with a BMI \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 25 (21.9 %), patients diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes (36.2 %), and those who did not exercise regularly (19.0 %). Adults without OA were more likely to exercise regularly (12 days per month or more) than adults diagnosed with OA.

We show that publicly available data on human mobility-collected by Google, Facebook, and other providers-can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and forecast the spread of COVID-19. This approach uses simple and transparent statistical models to estimate the effect of NPIs on mobility, and basic machine learning methods to generate 10-day forecasts of COVID-19 cases. An advantage of the approach is that it involves minimal assumptions about disease dynamics, and requires only publicly-available data. We evaluate this approach using local and regional data from China, France, Italy, South Korea, and the United States, as well as national data from 80 countries around the world. We find that NPIs are associated with significant reductions in human mobility, and that changes in mobility can be used to forecast COVID-19 infections."

Potentially, these records could be used to determine spatial patterns of plant species rarity and endemism. We test the integration of a large South Korean species record database with Rabinowitz rarity classes. Rabinowitz proposed seven classes of species rarity using three variables: geographic range, habitat specificity, and local population size. We estimated the range size and local abundance of 2,215 plant species from species occurrence records and habitat specificity as the number of landcover types each species' records were found in. We classified each species into a rarity class or as common, compared species composition by class to national lists, and mapped the spatial pattern of species richness for each rarity class. Species were classed to narrow or wide geographic ranges using 315&nbsp;km, the average from a range size index of all species (D max), based on maximum distance between observations. There were four classes each within the narrow and wide range groups, sorted using cutoffs of local abundance and habitat specificity. Nationally listed endangered species only appeared in the narrow-range classes, while nationally listed endemic species appeared in almost all classes. Species richness in most rarity classes was high in northeastern South Korea especially for species with narrow ranges. Policy implications. Large presence-only surveys may be able to estimate some classes of rarity better than others, but modification to include estimates of local abundance and habitat types, could greatly increase their utility. Application of the Rabinowitz rarity framework to such surveys can extend their utility beyond species distribution models and can identify areas that need further surveys and for conservation priority. Future studies should be aware of the subjectivity of the rarity classification and that regional scale implementations of the framework may differ."

Extreme events are becoming more frequent and thresholds are likely to be crossed more often, creating greater uncertainty about future conditions. The accelerating speed of change means that ecological systems may not remain stable long enough for scientists to understand them, much less use their research findings to inform policy and management. Faced with these challenges, those involved in science, policy, and management must adapt and change and anticipate what the ecosystems may be like in the future.

          "abstract": "BackgroundDespite growing research on the association between discrimination and disparities in cognitive aging, an evidence gap remains on how the association varies by racial/ethnic group. This study evaluates the associations of experiences of discrimination with cognitive function and whether these associations varied by race/ethnicity and nativity.MethodUsing the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences (KHANDLE) cohort (N = 1 712) with approximately equal groups of Black, White, Latino, and Asian community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and older, we evaluated the associations between self-reported experiences of everyday and major lifetime discrimination with overall cognitive performance and domain-specific cognition (verbal episodic memory, semantic memory, and executive functioning) across race/ethnicity and nativity. Linear regression models examined the cross-sectional association between self-reported experiences of everyday and major lifetime discrimination with z-standardized coefficients for cognition. We tested for effect modification by race and nativity. All models controlled for age, sex, and education.ResultsAmong KHANDLE participants (mean age: 76 years; SD: 6.8), everyday discrimination was not associated with cognitive scores. Major lifetime discrimination was associated with better average cognitive scores among Black participants but not among other racial/ethnic groups. Major lifetime discrimination was associated with better average cognitive scores among U.S.-born but not among non-U.S.-born individuals.ConclusionOur findings do not imply that discrimination improves cognition, but rather suggest that future research should include more detailed measures on discrimination and unfair treatment that could help disentangle the extent to which relationships are causal or reflect some other underlying factor."

          "abstract": "The US Gulf Coast is often struck by severe hurricane events. These natural events can cause massive economic and life losses. Based on the projected increase in global sea surface temperature and in population residing along the US Gulf Coast region, the intensity of future hurricanes is expected to increase with time in conjunction with an increase in vulnerability, leading to a significant increase of the risk for future catastrophic hurricane events. Therefore, there is an urgent research need for hurricane risk assessment and mitigation techniques that can quantify the effects of climate change. This paper presents a comprehensive statistical model to account for the effects of climate change on hurricane wind hazard. The model is based on a linear regression of historical hurricane characteristics versus historical sea surface temperature at the time and location of the hurricanes. The proposed model is validated by comparing the simulated hurricane wind speed distributions at any given site along the US Gulf Coast with the wind speed data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The validated wind speed model is used, in conjunction with the future climatological scenarios proposed by the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to forecast future hurricane wind speed distributions along the US Gulf Coast. These wind speed distributions are used within a multilayer Monte Carlo simulation implementation of the Performance-Based Hurricane Engineering framework to estimate potential hurricane-induced losses for a single-family residential building located near Miami, FL. The loss analysis results show that the expected hurricane-induced losses could increase by up to 35% under the projected worst-case scenario in 2060 when compared to the expected losses corresponding to the 2015 climatological conditions."

Backyard chickens (BYCs) submitted to the Davis (Northern California; NorCal) and San Bernardino (Southern California; SoCal) branches of the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System from January through March 2019 were included in the study. Trachea, kidney, and cecal tonsils were collected for real-time reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and sequence analysis. A total of 50 chickens out of 169 submissions tested positive for IBV by qRT-PCR. Of these, 16% (20/123) were from NorCal and 65% (30/46) from SoCal laboratory. The cecal tonsil was the most frequently positive tissue by qRT-PCR and IHC. Lymphoplasmacytic tracheitis was the most frequent histopathologic finding in 24 of 39 birds, while the kidney showed interstitial nephritis, tubular necrosis, tubular dilation, and/or gout in 14 of 43 chickens. Infectious bronchitis virus played a primary role or a synergistic effect in the mortality of chickens that succumbed to other infectious diseases. The sequences of IBV detected in 22 birds were analyzed, and 14 strains were most similar to CA1737. One strain each matched Conn46, Cal99, and ArkDPI, and the remaining five did not have a substantial match to any available reference strains. The findings in this study indicate that small flocks can be reservoirs of IBV and might facilitate evolution of new variants as well as reversion of attenuated strains to virulence."

A total of 50 chickens out of 169 submissions tested positive for IBV by qRT-PCR. Of these, 16% (20/123) were from NorCal and 65% (30/46) from SoCal laboratory. The cecal tonsil was the most frequently positive tissue by qRT-PCR and IHC. Lymphoplasmacytic tracheitis was the most frequent histopathologic finding in 24 of 39 birds, while the kidney showed interstitial nephritis, tubular necrosis, tubular dilation, and/or gout in 14 of 43 chickens. Infectious bronchitis virus played a primary role or a synergistic effect in the mortality of chickens that succumbed to other infectious diseases. The sequences of IBV detected in 22 birds were analyzed, and 14 strains were most similar to CA1737. One strain each matched Conn46, Cal99, and ArkDPI, and the remaining five did not have a substantial match to any available reference strains. The findings in this study indicate that small flocks can be reservoirs of IBV and might facilitate evolution of new variants as well as reversion of attenuated strains to virulence."

          "abstract": "A promising tsunami warning system outlined here links Total Electron Content (TEC) disturbances in the ionosphere detected by GNSS satellites to maps of inundated areas along the affected coastlines. This will be accomplished through a pipeline of earthquake, ionosphere, and tsunami simulations. The focus of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of our tsunami simulator for use in this simulation pipeline. The simulator we have developed is called Tsunami Squares, a computationally inexpensive program that employs a unique method of propagating water according to shallow water theory. Unlike other wave simulators, Tsunami Squares can easily propagate waves from sea to land, allowing flooded areas along the coast to be mapped. To validate its accuracy, a comparison is made to the Regional Ocean Modeling System tsunami simulator, which solves the Navier Stokes equations directly using a finite-difference method. The two simulation techniques show good agreement when compared over the 2011 Japan event and the 2010 Chile event. In addition, examples of inundation plots are displayed here to demonstrate its capability for such a warning system."

          "abstract": "Crop-associated microbiota are a key factor affecting host health and productivity. Most crops are grown within heterogeneous landscapes, and interactions between management practices and landscape context often affect plant and animal biodiversity in agroecosystems. However, whether these same factors typically affect crop-associated microbiota is less clear. Here, we assessed whether orchard management strategies and landscape context affected bacterial and fungal communities in pear (Pyrus communis) flowers. We found that bacteria and fungi responded differently to management schemes. Organically certified orchards had higher fungal diversity in flowers than conventional or bio-based integrated pest management (IPM) orchards, but organic orchards had the lowest bacterial diversity. Orchard management scheme also best predicted the distribution of several important bacterial and fungal genera that either cause or suppress disease; organic and bio-based IPM best explained the distributions of bacterial and fungal genera, respectively. Moreover, patterns of bacterial and fungal diversity were affected by interactions between management, landscape context, and climate. When examining the similarity of bacterial and fungal communities across sites, both abundance- and taxon-related turnovers were mediated primarily by orchard management scheme and landscape context and, specifically, the amount of land in cultivation. Our study reveals local- and landscape-level drivers of floral microbiome structure in a major fruit crop, providing insights that can inform microbiome management to promote host health and high-yielding quality fruit. IMPORTANCE Proper crop management during bloom is essential for producing disease-free tree fruit. Tree fruits are often grown in heterogeneous landscapes; however, few studies have assessed whether landscape context and crop management affect the floral microbiome, which plays a critical role in shaping plant health and disease tolerance. Such work is key for identification of tactics and/or contexts where beneficial microbes proliferate and pathogenic microbes are limited. Here, we characterize the floral microbiome of pear crops in Washington State, where major production occurs in intermountain valleys and basins with variable elevation and microclimates. Our results show that both local-level (crop management) and landscape-level (habitat types and climate) factors affect floral microbiota but in disparate ways for each kingdom. More broadly, these findings can potentially inform microbiome management in orchards for promotion of host health and high-quality yields."

An initial set of AUC was reported by the American Society of Dermatopathology (ASDP) in 2018. AUC reflect evidence collected at single timepoints and may be affected by evolving evidence and experience. The objective of this study was to update and expand AUC for selected tests.MethodsRAND/UCLA (RAND Corporation [Santa Monica, CA]/University of California Los Angeles) methodology used includes the following: (a) literature review; (b) review of previously rated tests and previously employed clinical scenarios; (c) selection of previously rated tests for new ratings; (d) development of new clinical scenarios; (e) selection of additional tests; (f) three rating rounds with feedback and group discussion after rounds 1 and 2.ResultsFor 220 clinical scenarios comprising lymphoproliferative (light chain clonality), melanocytic (comparative genomic hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter), vascular disorders (MYC), and inflammatory dermatoses (periodic acid-Schiff, G\u00c3\u00b6m\u00c3\u00b6ri methenamine silver), consensus by panel raters was reached in 172 of 220 (78%) scenarios, with 103 of 148 (70%) rated \"usually appropriate\" or \"rarely appropriate\" and 45 of 148 (30%), \"appropriateness uncertain.\"LimitationsThe study design only measures appropriateness. Cost, availability, test comparison, and additional clinical considerations are not measured. The possibility that the findings of this study may be influenced by the inherent biases of the dermatopathologists involved in the study cannot be excluded.ConclusionsAUC are reported for selected diagnostic tests in clinical scenarios that occur in dermatopathology practice.

We consider this analogy both with and without damage. With damage the rupture is equivalent to an equilibrium phase change, without damage the rupture is equivalent to a spinodal phase change.We argue that the absence of a systematic precursory acceleration of seismicity prior to earthquakes is evidence that precursory damage does nor occur.

Dependency on field size, depth, dose, dose rate, and temperature were evaluated in a water tank and compared to calibration data from commissioning and annual QA. Angularity was evaluated with a 3D printed phantom. The clinical evaluation was first performed in two cadaver dogs, and then in three companion animal dogs receiving radiation therapy for nasal tumors. A treatment planning CT scan was performed for cadavers and clinical patients. Prior to treatment, the probe was inserted into the radiation field. Radiation was then delivered and measured with the scintillator. For cadavers, the treatment was repeated after making an intentional shift in patient position to simulate a treatment error.ResultsIn the preclinical measurements the dose differed from annual measurements as follows: field size -0.77 to 0.43%, depth dose -0.36 to 1.14%, dose -0.54 to 2.93%, dose rate 0.3 to 3.6%, and angularity -1.18 to 0.01%. Temperature dependency required a correction factor of 0.11%/\u00c2\u00b0C. In the two cadavers, the dose differed by -1.17 to 0.91%. The device correctly detected the treatment error when the heads were intentionally laterally shifted. In three canine clinical patients treated in multiple fractions, the detected dose ranged from 98.33 to 103.15%.ConclusionResults of this new device are promising although more work is necessary to fully validate it for clinical dosimetry."

A treatment planning CT scan was performed for cadavers and clinical patients. Prior to treatment, the probe was inserted into the radiation field. Radiation was then delivered and measured with the scintillator. For cadavers, the treatment was repeated after making an intentional shift in patient position to simulate a treatment error.ResultsIn the preclinical measurements the dose differed from annual measurements as follows: field size -0.77 to 0.43%, depth dose -0.36 to 1.14%, dose -0.54 to 2.93%, dose rate 0.3 to 3.6%, and angularity -1.18 to 0.01%. Temperature dependency required a correction factor of 0.11%/\u00c2\u00b0C. In the two cadavers, the dose differed by -1.17 to 0.91%. The device correctly detected the treatment error when the heads were intentionally laterally shifted. In three canine clinical patients treated in multiple fractions, the detected dose ranged from 98.33 to 103.15%.ConclusionResults of this new device are promising although more work is necessary to fully validate it for clinical dosimetry."

A technology-enabled One Health (OH) surveillance program offers an opportunity for early detection and response as well as prevention of disease outbreaks in resource-limited settings. As an initial step toward developing the surveillance program, we aimed to identify at-risk groups of households for potential shared health challenges at the human-animal-environmental interface in a rural community of the Philippines.MethodsA cross-sectional household survey was conducted in the municipality of Los Ba\u00c3\u00b1os in proximity (63 kilometers south) to Metro Manila by enumerators living in the same community. Twenty-four enumerators conducted household interviews asking a) household characteristics including ownership of animals and crops; b) awareness, beliefs and knowledge about OH; c) family-level health practices related to sanitation, hygiene, and food safety; and d) risk factors for potential OH issues. All data collection and transferring process were streamlined using a mobile application.ResultsOf 6,055 participating households, 68% reported having one or more of gardens, farms, and animals for various reasons. While only 2% of the households have heard about OH, 97% believed they can get disease from animals, plants or the environment. A latent class analysis with nine risk factors for potential OH issues suggested that 46% of the households were at moderate to high risk for exposure to zoonotic pathogens and environmental contaminants.ConclusionOur findings indicate that there are unaddressed threats to human, animal, and plant health. Given the importance of the interconnections between the health of humans, animals, and plants, further evaluations of the at-risk households would be necessary to mitigate potential shared health threats in the community. Further, our study demonstrates that mHealth technology can provide an opportunity to systematically assess potential one health problems in the rural communities with limited internet connection."

          "abstract": "ObjectiveHispanic/Latino individuals in the U.S. have the highest prevalence of undiagnosed and untreated diabetes and are at increased risk for cognitive impairment. In this study, we examine glycemic control in relation to cognitive aging and impairment in a large prospective cohort of middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals of diverse heritages.Research design and methodsStudy of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) is a Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) ancillary study. HCHS/SOL is a multisite (Bronx, NY; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; and San Diego, CA), probability sampled prospective cohort study. SOL-INCA enrolled 6,377 diverse Hispanic/Latino individuals aged 50 years and older (2016-2018). The primary outcomes were cognitive function, 7-year cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The primary glycemia exposure variables were measured from fasting blood samples collected at HCHS/SOL visit 1 (2008-2011).ResultsVisit 1 mean age was 56.5 years \u00c2\u00b1 8.2 SD, and the average glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) was 6.12% (43.5 \u00c2\u00b1 14.6 mmol/mol). After covariate adjustment, higher HbA1c was associated with accelerated 7-year global (b = -0.045; 95% CI -0.070; -0.021; in z score units) and executive cognitive decline and a higher prevalence of MCI (odds ratio 1.20; 95% CI 1.11; 1.29).ConclusionsElevated HbA1c levels were associated with 7-year executive cognitive decline and increased MCI risk among diverse middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals. Our findings indicate that poor glycemic control in midlife may pose significant risks for cognitive decline and MCI later in life among Hispanic/Latino individuals of diverse heritages."

IVD calcification, vertebral column length, and vertebral geometry of the third cervical (C3), 13th thoracic (T13), and first lumbar (L1) vertebrae were compared.ResultsIVD calcification was not found in wild-type dogs. IVD calcification was more frequent in homozygous dogs than heterozygous (P = .008) or wild-type dogs (P < .001) and in heterozygous dogs compared to wild-type dogs (P < .001). Four IVDs were subclinically herniated in 3 dogs (2 homozygous, 1 heterozygous). Calcified IVD had a greater volume and surface area in heterozygous dogs than homozygous dogs. C3 vertebral canal height-to-width ratio was greater in homozygous dogs than heterozygous dogs (P = .044) and wild-type dogs (P = .010).Clinical relevanceIVD calcification and vertebral geometry can be analyzed using CAD software. The presence of 1 or 2 FGF4L2 copies in the absence of the FGF4L1 retrogene has an additive effect on the number of calcified IVD and a minor effect on vertebral geometry in NSDTR dogs. Data support the use of FGF4L2 phenotyping to reduce clinical disease in segregating breeds and to monitor the introduction of wild-type alleles into fixed breed populations."

          "abstract": "A large set of genome-wide markers and a high-throughput genotyping platform can facilitate the genetic dissection of complex traits and accelerate molecular breeding applications. Previously, we identified about 0.9 million SNP markers by sequencing transcriptomes of 27 diverse alfalfa genotypes. From this SNP set, we developed an Illumina Infinium array containing 9,277 SNPs. Using this array, we genotyped 280 diverse alfalfa genotypes and several genotypes from related species. About 81% (7,476) of the SNPs met the criteria for quality control and showed polymorphisms. The alfalfa SNP array also showed a high level of transferability for several closely related Medicago species. Principal component analysis and model-based clustering showed clear population structure corresponding to subspecies and ploidy levels. Within cultivated tetraploid alfalfa, genotypes from dormant and nondormant cultivars were largely assigned to different clusters; genotypes from semidormant cultivars were split between the groups. The extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across all genotypes rapidly decayed to 26 Kbp at r(2)\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01600.2, but the rate varied across ploidy levels and subspecies. A high level of consistency in LD was found between and within the two subpopulations of cultivated dormant and nondormant alfalfa suggesting that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) could be conducted using alfalfa genotypes from throughout the fall dormancy spectrum. However, the relatively low LD levels would require a large number of markers to fully saturate the genome."

          "abstract": "Camera traps are a key tool in ecological studies, and are increasingly being used to understand entire communities. However, robust inferences continue to be hampered by low detection of rare and elusive species. Attractants can be used to increase detection rates, but may also alter behaviour, and little research has evaluated short-term, localized response to the presence of attractants. We conducted three camera trap surveys in Kibale National Park, Uganda, using food baits and scent lures (\"attractants\") at each camera station to entice small carnivores to pass in front of camera stations. To examine the interrelationship between scavenging and response to attractants, we also placed camera traps at five food refuse pits. We modelled the effect of attractant and duration of trap placement on the detection probability of small carnivores and selected African golden cat Caracal aurata prey items. We examine transient site response of each species, by comparing our observed likelihood of detection in each 24 h period from 1-7 d following refreshing of attractants to randomly generated capture histories. African civet Civettictis civetta, rusty-spotted genet Genetta maculata, African palm civet Nandinia binotata, and marsh mongoose Atilax paludinosus detection probabilities were highest and Weyns's red duiker Cephalophus wenysi detection probability was lowest immediately after attractants were placed. Within 24 h after attractant was placed, rusty-spotted genet and African palm civet were more likely to be detected and African golden cat, red duiker, and blue duiker Philantomba monticola were less likely to be detected. Our results suggest that attractants can increase detection of small-bodied species and include some arboreal species in terrestrial camera trap sampling. However, attractants may also alter short-term visitation rates of some species, with potentially cascading effects on others. Community level and intraguild interaction studies should control for the potentially confounding effects of attractants on spatial activity patterns."

Using a mosquito surveillance program in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) and San Antonio, TX, from 2016 to 2018, we detected the presence of an insect-specific virus, cell fusing agent virus (CFAV), in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population. We tested 6,326 females and 1,249 males from the LRGV and 659 females from San Antonio for CFAV by RT-PCR using specific primers. Infection rates varied from 0 to 261 per 1,000 mosquitoes in the LRGV and 115 to 208 per 1,000 in San Antonio depending on the month of collection. Infection rates per 1,000 individuals appeared higher in females collected from BG Sentinel 2 traps compared to Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps, but the ratio of the percentage of infected pools did not differ by trap type. The natural viral load in individual males ranged from 1.25 x 102 to 5.50 x 106 RNA copies and in unfed females from 5.42 x 103 to 8.70 x 106 RNA copies. Gravid females were found to harbor fewer viral particles than males and unfed females."

Paleoethnobotanical data further show that tubers may have been the most prominent subsistence resource. These findings update our understanding of earliest forager economies and the pathway to agricultural economies in the Andean highlands. The findings furthermore suggest that the initial subsistence economies of early human populations adapting to new landscapes may have been more plant oriented than current models suggest."

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Information on salt consumption patterns is needed to inform the need for and design of salt reduction strategies. OBJECTIVES: In northern Ghana, this study aimed to estimate household consumption of salt, including salt from bouillon, and compare (estimated) women and childrens salt intake to global recommendations; to estimate the proportion of salt consumed from bouillon; and to identify factors, including knowledge, attitudes, and practices, associated with household salt consumption. METHODS: Employing mixed-methods methodology, we conducted a pilot survey (n = 369 households enrolled) and focus group discussions (FGDs; n = 20) in Tolon and Kumbungu districts (14 urban, 14 rural clusters) (clinicaltrials.gov registry: NCT04632771). Households reported purchases of discretionary salt (DS, table salt) and bouillon cubes. DS and total salt (TS; DS+salt from bouillon) consumption for women (15-49 y) and children (2-5 y) were estimated using the Adult Male Equivalent method and compared with global recommendations (<5 g/d women; <3.75 g/d children). Womens salt intake was also predicted from urinary sodium excretion (INTERSALT equation). Associations between DS and TS consumption, as well as household and womens characteristics, were tested with minimally adjusted and multivariable linear mixed-effects models. Qualitative FGD themes were generated using the Framework Method. RESULTS: From household purchase data, estimated TS consumption exceeded global recommendations for 44% of children [median: 2.9 (IQR: 1.9, 5.2) g/d] and 60% of women [6.0 (4.0, 10.2) g/d]; 35% of children and 50% of women exceeded recommendations from DS alone. Bouillon contributed <25% of households TS consumption. Few characteristics were associated with DS or TS consumption. Salient qualitative themes that shaped salt consumption behaviors included salts ubiquity as a seasoning, key household members influence on food procurement and preparation, and perceptions about health. CONCLUSIONS: Purchase data suggest salt consumption among women and children exceeds recommendations, even when excluding salt from bouillon; food prepared outside the home likely further contributes. Salt reduction interventions may be warranted in this context."

A novel approach that combines the advantages of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to detail micromorphological structures. A simplified classification system for sensilla that eliminates the subjective aspects of morphology, such as their shape, is proposed. Fourteen sensory organs have been classified into three main groups: (a) aporous sensilla with a flexible socket, (b) porous sensilla with a flexible socket and (c) porous sensilla with an inflexible socket. A large variety of sensory organs (nine types) with olfactory functions are described. The antennal sensory organs have been recognized as one of the factors responsible for the evolutionary success of Leptoglossus spp. and their status as important pests and invasive species."

          "abstract": "Drosophila suzukii lay eggs in soft-skinned, ripening fruits, making this insect a serious threat to berry production. Since its 2008 introduction into North America, growers have used insecticides, such as pyrethroids and spinosads, as the primary approach for D. suzukii management, resulting in development of insecticide resistance in this pest. This study sought to identify the molecular mechanisms conferring insecticide resistance in these populations. We sequenced the transcriptomes of two pyrethroid- and two spinosad-resistant isofemale lines. In both pyrethroid-resistant lines and one spinosad-resistant line, we identified overexpression of metabolic genes that are implicated in resistance in other insect pests. In the other spinosad-resistant line, we observed an overexpression of cuticular genes that have been linked to resistance. Our findings enabled the development of molecular diagnostics that we used to confirm persistence of insecticide resistance in California, U.S.A. To validate these findings, we leveraged D. melanogaster mutants with reduced expression of metabolic or cuticular genes that were found to be upregulated in resistant D. suzukii to demonstrate that these genes are involved in promoting resistance. This study is the first to characterize the molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance in D. suzukii and provides insights into how current management practices can be optimized."
