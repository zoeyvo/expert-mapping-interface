"DECARLI, Charles",Association of common genetic variants in GPCPD1 with scaling of visual cortical surface area in humans.,"Visual cortical surface area varies two- to threefold between human individuals, is highly heritable, and has been correlated with visual acuity and visual perception. However, it is still largely unknown what specific genetic and environmental factors contribute to normal variation in the area of visual cortex. To identify SNPs associated with the proportional surface area of visual cortex, we performed a genome-wide association study followed by replication in two independent cohorts. We identified one SNP (rs6116869) that replicated in both cohorts and had genome-wide significant association (P(combined) = 3.2 Ã— 10(-8)). Furthermore, a metaanalysis of imputed SNPs in this genomic region identified a more significantly associated SNP (rs238295; P = 6.5 Ã— 10(-9)) that was in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs6116869. These SNPs are located within 4 kb of the 5' UTR of GPCPD1, glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase GDE1 homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which in humans, is more highly expressed in occipital cortex compared with the remainder of cortex than 99.9% of genes genome-wide. Based on these findings, we conclude that this common genetic variation contributes to the proportional area of human visual cortex. We suggest that identifying genes that contribute to normal cortical architecture provides a first step to understanding genetic mechanisms that underlie visual perception."

"CHERTOK, Maxwell B",Measurement of The Single Top Quark Production Cross Section at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV,"Within the standard model top quarks are predicted to be most often produced in pairsvia the strong interaction. However they can also be produced singly through the weakinteraction. This is a rarer process with many experimental challenges. It is interestingbecause it provides a new window to search for evidence of physics beyond the standardmodel picture, such as a fourth generation of quarks or to search for insight into the HiggsMechanism. Single top production also provides a direct way to calculate the CKM matrixelement Vtb.       This thesis presents new measurements for single top quark production in the s+t, s andt channels using 5.4 fb-1 of data collected at the DÃ˜ detector at Fermilab in Batavia, IL.  The analysis was performed using Boosted decision trees to separate signal from background and Bayesian statistcs to calculate all the cross sections. The results obtained are:s channel :  Ïƒ (ppbar â†’ tb + X) = 0.68 +0.41 - 0.39 pb,t channel :  Ïƒ (ppbar â†’ tqb + X) = 3.03 +0.78 - 0.66 pb,Combined s+t channels :   Ïƒ(ppbar â†’ tb + X, tqb + X) = 3.01 +0.80 - 0.75 pb.     The s channel has a Gaussian significance of 1.6Ïƒ, the t channel 5.5Ïƒ, and the s+t 4.3Ïƒ.  The results are consistent with the standard model predictions within one standard deviation. By combining these results with the results for two other analyses (using different MVA techniques) improved results of:Combined s+t channels :   Ïƒ(ppbar â†’ tb + X, tqb + X) = 3.43 +0.73 - 0.74 pb,t channel :  Ïƒ(ppbar â†’ tqb + X) = 2.90 +0.59 - 0.59 pb.were obtained. These give a 5.6Ïƒ significance for the combined s + t channel and 5.5Ïƒ for the t channel."

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 11.7 fb-1 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. In this search, a dimensionless kinematic variable, Î±T, is used to discriminate between events with genuine and misreconstructed missing transverse energy. The search is based on an examination of the number of reconstructed jets per event, the scalar sum of transverse energies of these jets, and the number of these jets identified as originating from bottom quarks. No significant excess of events over the standard model expectation is found. Exclusion limits are set in the parameter space of simplified models, with a special emphasis on both compressed-spectrum scenarios and direct or gluino-induced production of third-generation squarks. For the case of gluino-mediated squark production, gluino masses up to 950-1125&nbsp;GeV are excluded depending on the assumed model. For the direct pair-production of squarks, masses up to 450&nbsp;GeV are excluded for a single light first- or second-generation squark, increasing to 600&nbsp;GeV for bottom squarks."

Here, we present MotifIndexer--a comprehensive strategy for de novo identification of DNA regulatory motifs at a genome level. Using word-counting methods, we indexed the existence of every 8-mer oligo composed of bases A, C, G, T, r, y, s, w, m, k, n or 12-mer oligo composed of A, C, G, T, n, in the promoters of all predicted genes of Arabidopsis thaliana genome and of selected stress-induced co-expressed genes. From this analysis, we identified number of over-represented motifs. Among these, major critical motifs were identified using a position filter. We used a model based on uniform distribution and the z-scores derived from this model to describe position bias. Interestingly, many motifs showed position bias towards the transcription start site. We extended this model to show biased distribution of motifs in the genomes of both A. thaliana and rice. We also used MotifIndexer to identify conserved motifs in co-expressed gene groups from two Arabidopsis species, A. thaliana and A. lyrata. This new comparative genomics method does not depend on alignments of homologous gene promoter sequences."

"LIU, Kai",Anisotropy dependence of irreversible switching in Fe/SmCo and FeNi/FePt exchange spring magnet films,"Magnetization reversal in exchange-spring magnet films has been investigated by a first-order reversal curve (FORC) technique and vector magnetometry. In Fe/epitaxial-SmCo films, the reversal proceeds by a reversible rotation of the Fe soft layer, followed by an irreversible switching of the SmCo hard layer. The switching fields are clearly manifested by separate steps in both longitudinal and transverse hysteresis loops, as well as sharp boundaries in the FORC distribution. In FeNi/polycrystalline-FePt films, particularly with thin FeNi, the switching fields are masked by the smooth and step-free major loop. However, the FORC diagram still displays a distinct onset of irreversible switching and transverse hysteresis loops exhibit a pair of peaks, whose amplitude is larger than the maximum possible contribution from the FeNi layer alone. This suggests that the FeNi and FePt layers reverse in a continuous process via a vertical spiral. The successive versus continuous rotation of the soft/hard layer system is primarily due to the different crystal structure of the hard layer, which results in different anisotropies."

The objective was to evaluate the natural history of sperm concentration and selected hormonal parameters in patients with testicular cancer treated with orchiectomy and radiotherapy.Methods and materialsOf a total of 207 patients enrolled on SWOG 8711, 53 pure seminoma patients were identified who were treated with orchiectomy and radiotherapy only. Sperm concentration, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and sexual satisfaction scores were the main parameters followed.ResultsA fraction of the patients were infertile prior to receiving radiotherapy. Our analysis indicates that incidental radiation dose to the remaining testicle affects time to recovery of fertility, and at an aggregate level, changes in FSH mirror changes in sperm concentration over time. This phenomenon is the same as that described in patients free from testicular cancer. These men evaluated their sexual activity as good after orchidectomy.ConclusionOur data support the use of clamshell-type testicular shields as a means of providing maximum protection to the remaining testicle."

"YAROV-YAROVOY, Vladimir",Functional interaction with filamin A and intracellular Ca2+ enhance the surface membrane expression of a small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK2) channel,"For an excitable cell to function properly, a precise number of ion channel proteins need to be trafficked to distinct locations on the cell surface membrane, through a network and anchoring activity of cytoskeletal proteins. Not surprisingly, mutations in anchoring proteins have profound effects on membrane excitability. Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (KCa2 or SK) have been shown to play critical roles in shaping the cardiac atrial action potential profile. Here, we demonstrate that filamin A, a cytoskeletal protein, augments the trafficking of SK2 channels in cardiac myocytes. The trafficking of SK2 channel is Ca(2+)-dependent. Further, the Ca(2+) dependence relies on another channel-interacting protein, Î±-actinin2, revealing a tight, yet intriguing, assembly of cytoskeletal proteins that orchestrate membrane expression of SK2 channels in cardiac myocytes. We assert that changes in SK channel trafficking would significantly alter atrial action potential and consequently atrial excitability. Identification of therapeutic targets to manipulate the subcellular localization of SK channels is likely to be clinically efficacious. The findings here may transcend the area of SK2 channel studies and may have implications not only in cardiac myocytes but in other types of excitable cells."

"PAW U, Kyaw T",Observed increase in local cooling effect of deforestation at higher latitudes,"Deforestation in mid- to high latitudes is hypothesized to have the potential to cool the Earth's surface by altering biophysical processes. In climate models of continental-scale land clearing, the cooling is triggered by increases in surface albedo and is reinforced by a land albedo-sea ice feedback. This feedback is crucial in the model predictions; without it other biophysical processes may overwhelm the albedo effect to generate warming instead. Ongoing land-use activities, such as land management for climate mitigation, are occurring at local scales (hectares) presumably too small to generate the feedback, and it is not known whether the intrinsic biophysical mechanism on its own can change the surface temperature in a consistent manner. Nor has the effect of deforestation on climate been demonstrated over large areas from direct observations. Here we show that surface air temperature is lower in open land than in nearby forested land. The effect is 0.85 Â± 0.44 K (mean Â± one standard deviation) northwards of 45Â° N and 0.21 Â± 0.53 K southwards. Below 35Â° N there is weak evidence that deforestation leads to warming. Results are based on comparisons of temperature at forested eddy covariance towers in the USA and Canada and, as a proxy for small areas of cleared land, nearby surface weather stations. Night-time temperature changes unrelated to changes in surface albedo are an important contributor to the overall cooling effect. The observed latitudinal dependence is consistent with theoretical expectation of changes in energy loss from convection and radiation across latitudes in both the daytime and night-time phase of the diurnal cycle, the latter of which remains uncertain in climate models."

"DICKINSON, Peter J",Genome-wide association analysis identifies a mutation in the thiamine transporter 2 (SLC19A3) gene associated with Alaskan Husky encephalopathy.,"Alaskan Husky Encephalopathy (AHE) has been previously proposed as a mitochondrial encephalopathy based on neuropathological similarities with human Leigh Syndrome (LS). We studied 11 Alaskan Husky dogs with AHE, but found no abnormalities in respiratory chain enzyme activities in muscle and liver, or mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear genes that cause LS in people. A genome wide association study was performed using eight of the affected dogs and 20 related but unaffected control AHs using the Illumina canine HD array. SLC19A3 was identified as a positional candidate gene. This gene controls the uptake of thiamine in the CNS via expression of the thiamine transporter protein THTR2. Dogs have two copies of this gene located within the candidate interval (SLC19A3.2 - 43.36-43.38 Mb and SLC19A3.1 - 43.411-43.419 Mb) on chromosome 25. Expression analysis in a normal dog revealed that one of the paralogs, SLC19A3.1, was expressed in the brain and spinal cord while the other was not. Subsequent exon sequencing of SLC19A3.1 revealed a 4bp insertion and SNP in the second exon that is predicted to result in a functional protein truncation of 279 amino acids (c.624 insTTGC, c.625 C>A). All dogs with AHE were homozygous for this mutation, 15/41 healthy AH control dogs were heterozygous carriers while 26/41 normal healthy AH dogs were wild type. Furthermore, this mutation was not detected in another 187 dogs of different breeds. These results suggest that this mutation in SLC19A3.1, encoding a thiamine transporter protein, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AHE."

"BLOCK, David E",Conversion of rice straw to bio-based chemicals: an integrated process using Lactobacillus brevis,"Commercialization of lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock for bio-based chemical production is problematic due to the high processing costs of pretreatment and saccharifying enzymes combined with low product yields. Such low product yield can be attributed, in large part, to the incomplete utilization of the various carbohydrate sugars found in the lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, we demonstrate that Lactobacillus brevis is able to simultaneously metabolize all fermentable carbohydrates in acid pre-processed rice straw hydrolysate, thereby allowing complete utilization of all released sugars. Inhibitors present in rice straw hydrolysate did not affect lactic acid production. Moreover, the activity of exogenously added cellulases was not reduced in the presence of growing cultures of L. brevis. These factors enabled the use of L. brevis in a process termed simultaneous saccharification and mixed sugar fermentation (SSMSF). In SSMSF with L. brevis, sugars present in rice straw hydrolysate were completely utilized while the cellulase maintained its maximum activity due to the lack of feedback inhibition from glucose and/or cellobiose. By comparison to a sequential hydrolysis and fermentation process, SSMSF reduced operation time and the amount of cellulase enzyme necessary to produce the same amount of lactic acid."

However, the underlying mechanism by which TDRD3 functions as a transcriptional coactivator is unknown. We identified topoisomerase IIIB (TOP3B) as a component of the TDRD3 complex. TDRD3 serves as a molecular bridge between TOP3B and arginine-methylated histones. The TDRD3-TOP3B complex is recruited to the c-MYC gene promoter primarily by the H4R3me2a mark, and the complex promotes c-MYC gene expression. TOP3B relaxes negative supercoiled DNA and reduces transcription-generated R loops in vitro. TDRD3 knockdown in cells increases R loop formation at the c-MYC locus, and Tdrd3 null mice exhibit elevated R loop formation at this locus in B cells. Tdrd3 null mice show significantly increased c-Myc/Igh translocation, a process driven by R loop structures. By reducing negative supercoiling and resolving R loops, TOP3B promotes transcription, protects against DNA damage, and reduces the frequency of chromosomal translocations."

We determined if the ability of postvaccination, prechallenge sera to enhance SIVmac251 transcytosis across epithelial cells was associated with transmitted/founder strain number.MethodsTranscytosis was carried out by exposing sera and SIVmac251 to the apical surface of human endometrial carcinoma (HEC-1A) cells at pH 6.0 and 12 hours later quantifying virus in fluid bathing the basolateral cell surface (maintained at pH 7.4). These conditions allow Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn)-dependent shuttling of virus across cells.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between the amount of virus transcytosed and number of transmitted variants (R = 0.86, P < .0001). We also found that 4 animals who remained uninfected after repeated rectal challenges had lower serum transcytosis activity than did 19 animals who subsequently became infected (P = .003). Using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated FcRn on columnar epithelial cells facing the lumen of the macaque rectum.ConclusionsVaccine-induced antibody capable of enhancing transcytosis in vitro via FcRn may play a role in determining transmitted/founder strain number and infection outcomes following in vivo challenge."
"SANKARAN-WALTERS, Sumathi",Reactivation of HIV latency by a newly modified Ingenol derivative via protein kinase C&amp;dgr;â€“NF-&amp;kgr;B signaling,"ObjectiveAlthough HAART effectively suppresses viral replication, it fails to eradicate latent viral reservoirs. The 'shock and kill' strategy involves the activation of HIV from latent reservoirs and targeting them for eradication. Our goal was to develop new approaches for activating HIV from latent reservoirs.DesignWe investigated capacity of Ingenol B (IngB), a newly modified derivative of Ingenol ester that was originally isolated from a Brazilian plant in Amazon, for its capacity and mechanisms of HIV reactivation.MethodsReactivation of HIV-1 by IngB was evaluated in J-Lat A1 cell culture model of HIV latency as well as in purified primary CD4 T cells from long-term HAART-treated virologically-suppressed HIV-infected individuals. The underlining molecular mechanisms of viral reactivation were investigated using flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation.ResultsIngB is highly effective in reactivating HIV in J-Lat A1 cells with relatively low cellular toxicity. It is also able to reactivate latent HIV in purified CD4 T cells from HAART-treated HIV-positive individuals ex vivo. Our data show that IngB may reactivate HIV expression by both activating protein kinase C (PKC)Î´-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ÎºB) pathway and directly inducing NF-ÎºB protein expression. Importantly, IngB has a synergistic effect with JQ1, a BET bromodomain inhibitor, in latent HIV reactivation.ConclusionsIngB is a new promising compound to activate latent HIV reservoirs. Our data suggest that formulating novel derivatives from Ingenol esters may be an innovative approach to develop new lead compounds to reactivate latent HIV."
"BALES, Karen L",Intranasal vasopressin affects pair bonding and peripheral gene expression in male Callicebus cupreus,"Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide hormone and neurotransmitter that has peripheral functions in water regulation, and central functions in the stress response and social bonding in male rodents. In this study, we investigated the role of AVP in partner preference behavior in a monogamous primate, the coppery titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus). Seven titi males each received three intranasal treatments: saline, low AVP (40 IU) and high AVP (80 IU) in random order, 1 week apart. They experienced a series of stimulus exposures to their female partner, a female stranger and an empty cage. Males were more likely to contact the stimulus and do so faster when either female stimulus was present. When pretreated with saline, males contacted the stranger more frequently than their partner; when pretreated with the high dosage of AVP, males contacted their partner more frequently than the stranger. We used microarray to measure peripheral changes in gene expression associated with intranasal AVP and found reduced expression of several genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines. The data presented here suggest that intranasally administered AVP has both central influences on social behavior and peripheral influences on inflammation in a nonhuman primate."
"STAMOVA, Boryana S",Gene expression in blood is associated with risperidone response in children with autism spectrum disorders,"Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) often have severe behavioral problems.

Exon expression levels in blood before risperidone treatment were compared with pre-post risperidone change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) scores. Expression of exons within five genes was correlated with change in ABC-I scores across all risperidone-treated subjects: GBP6, RABL5, RNF213, NFKBID and RNF40 (Î±<0.001). RNF40 is located at 16p11.2, a region implicated in autism and schizophrenia. Thus, these genes expressed before treatment were associated with subsequent clinical response. Future studies will be needed to confirm these results and determine whether this expression profile is associated with risperidone response in other disorders, or alternative antipsychotic response within ASD."

"BERBEN, Louise A",High work-function hole transport layers by self-assembly using a fluorinated additive,"The hole transport polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4- styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) derives many of its favorable properties from a PSS-rich interfacial layer that forms spontaneously during coating. Since PEDOT:PSS is only usable as a blend it is not possible to study PEDOT:PSS without this interfacial layer. Through the use of the self-doped polymer sulfonated poly(thiophene-3-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethoxy]-2,5-diyl) (S-P3MEET) and a polyfluorinated ionomer (PFI) it is possible to compare transparent conducting organic films with and without interfacial layers and to understand their function. Using neutron reflectometry, we show that PFI preferentially segregates at the top surface of the film during coating and forms a thermally-stable surface layer. Because of this distribution we find that even small amounts of PFI increase the electron work function of the hole transport layer. We also find that annealing at 150Â°C and above reduces the work function compared to samples heated at lower temperatures. Using near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and gas chromatography we show that this reduction in work function is due to S-P3MEET being doped by PFI. Organic photovoltaic devices with S-P3MEET/PFI hole transport layers yield higher power conversion efficiency than devices with pure S-P3MEET or PEDOT:PSS hole transport layers. Additionally, devices with a doped interface layer of S-P3MEET/PFI show superior performance to those with un-doped S-P3MEET. Â© 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry. 2014."
"HAVEL, Peter J","Chronic stress increases vulnerability to diet-related abdominal fat, oxidative stress, and metabolic risk","BackgroundIn preclinical studies, the combination of chronic stress and a high sugar/fat diet is a more potent driver of visceral adiposity than diet alone, a process mediated by peripheral neuropeptide Y (NPY).MethodsIn a human model of chronic stress, we investigated whether the synergistic combination of highly palatable foods (HPF; high sugar/fat) and stress was associated with elevated metabolic risk. Using a case-control design, we compared 33 post-menopausal caregivers (the chronic stress group) to 28 age-matched low-stress control women on reported HPF consumption (modified Block Food Frequency Questionnaire), waistline circumference, truncal fat ultrasound, and insulin sensitivity using a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test. A fasting blood draw was assayed for plasma NPY and oxidative stress markers (8-hydroxyguanosine and F2-Isoprostanes).ResultsAmong chronically stressed women only, greater HPF consumption was associated with greater abdominal adiposity, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance at baseline (all p'sâ‰¤.01). Furthermore, plasma NPY was significantly elevated in chronically stressed women (p<.01), and the association of HPF with abdominal adiposity was stronger among women with high versus low NPY. There were no significant predictions of change over 1-year, likely due to high stability (little change) in the primary outcomes over this period.DiscussionChronic stress is associated with enhanced vulnerability to diet-related metabolic risk (abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress). Stress-induced peripheral NPY may play a mechanistic role."

"CORD, Branden J",Using iPSC-derived neurons to uncover cellular phenotypes associated with Timothy syndrome,"Monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders provide key insights into the pathogenesis of disease and help us understand how specific genes control the development of the human brain. Timothy syndrome is caused by a missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(v)1.2 that is associated with developmental delay and autism. We generated cortical neuronal precursor cells and neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from individuals with Timothy syndrome. Cells from these individuals have defects in calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling and activity-dependent gene expression. They also show abnormalities in differentiation, including decreased expression of genes that are expressed in lower cortical layers and in callosal projection neurons. In addition, neurons derived from individuals with Timothy syndrome show abnormal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and increased production of norepinephrine and dopamine. This phenotype can be reversed by treatment with roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and atypical L-type-channel blocker. These findings provide strong evidence that Ca(v)1.2 regulates the differentiation of cortical neurons in humans and offer new insights into the causes of autism in individuals with Timothy syndrome."

Although RNA extracted from human milk has been used to assay the mammary transcriptome non-invasively, this assay has not been adequately validated in primates. Thus, the objectives of the current study were to assess the suitability of lactating rhesus macaques as a model for lactating humans and to determine whether RNA extracted from milk fractions is representative of RNA extracted from mammary tissue for the purpose of studying the transcriptome of milk-producing cells. Results We confirmed that macaque milk contains cytoplasmic crescents and that ample high-quality RNA can be obtained for sequencing. Using RNA sequencing, RNA extracted from macaque milk fat and milk cell fractions more accurately represented RNA from mammary epithelial cells (cells that produce milk) than did RNA from whole mammary tissue. Mammary epithelium-specific transcripts were more abundant in macaque milk fat, whereas adipose or stroma-specific transcripts were more abundant in mammary tissue. Functional analyses confirmed the validity of milk as a source of RNA from milk-producing mammary epithelial cells. Conclusions RNA extracted from the milk fat during lactation accurately portrayed the RNA profile of milk-producing mammary epithelial cells in a non-human primate. However, this sample type clearly requires protocols that minimize RNA degradation. Overall, we validated the use of RNA extracted from human and macaque milk and provided evidence to support the use of lactating macaques as a model for human lactation."

"JIN, Yufang",Contrasting controls on wildland fires in Southern California during periods with and without Santa Ana winds,"Wildland fires in Southern California can be divided into two categories: fall fires, which are typically driven by strong offshore Santa Ana winds, and summer fires, which occur with comparatively weak onshore winds and hot and dry weather. Both types of fire contribute significantly to annual burned area and economic loss. An improved understanding of the relationship between Southern California's meteorology and fire is needed to improve predictions of how fire will change in the future and to anticipate management needs. We used output from a regional climate model constrained by reanalysis observations to identify Santa Ana events and partition fires into those occurring during periods with and without Santa Ana conditions during 1959â€“2009. We then developed separate empirical regression models for Santa Ana and non-Santa Ana fires to quantify the effects of meteorology on fire number and size. These models explained approximately 58% of the seasonal and interannual variation in the number of Santa Ana fires and 36% of the variation in non-Santa Ana fires. The number of Santa Ana fires increased during years when relative humidity during Santa Ana events and fall precipitation were below average, indicating that fuel moisture is a key controller of ignition. Relative humidity strongly affected Santa Ana fire size. Cumulative precipitation during the previous three winters was significantly correlated with the number of non-Santa Ana fires, presumably through increased fine fuel density and connectivity between infrastructure and nearby vegetation. Both relative humidity and the preceding wet season precipitation influenced non-Santa Ana fire size. Regression models driven by meteorology explained 57% of the temporal variation in Santa Ana burned area and 22% of the variation in non-Santa Ana burned area. The area burned by non-Santa Ana fires has increased steadily by 1.7% yearâˆ’1&nbsp;since 1959 (pâ€‰<â€‰0.006); the occurrence of extremely large Santa Ana fires has increased abruptly since 2003. Our results underscore the need to separately consider the fuel and meteorological controls on Santa Ana and non-Santa Ana fires when projecting climate change impacts on regional fire."

Nutrient levels and their cellular distribution patterns in stems and leaves of grapefruit were analysed after graft-inoculation with lemon scions containing 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (Las), the heat-tolerant Asian type of the HLB bacterium. After 12 months, affected plants showed typical HLB symptoms and significantly reduced Zn concentrations in leaves. Micro-XRF imaging of Zn and other nutrients showed that preferential localization of Zn to phloem tissues was observed in the stems and leaves collected from healthy grapefruit plants, but was absent from HLB-affected samples. Quantitative analysis by using standard references revealed that Zn concentration in the phloem of veins in healthy leaves was more than 10 times higher than that in HLB-affected leaves. No significant variation was observed in the distribution patterns of other elements such as Ca in stems and leaves of grapefruit plants with or without graft-inoculation of infected lemon scions. These results suggest that reduced phloem transport of Zn is an important factor contributing to HLB-induced Zn deficiency in grapefruit. Our report provides the first in situ, cellular level visualization of elemental variations within the tissues of HLB-affected citrus. Â© 2014 Â© The Author 2014.

"JULIANO, Celina",PIWI proteins and PIWI-interacting RNAs function in Hydra somatic stem cells,"PIWI proteins and their bound PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are found in animal germlines and are essential for fertility, but their functions outside of the gonad are not well understood. The cnidarian Hydra is a simple metazoan with well-characterized stem/progenitor cells that provides a unique model for analysis of PIWI function. Here we report that Hydra has two PIWI proteins, Hydra PIWI (Hywi) and Hydra PIWI-like (Hyli), both of which are expressed in all Hydra stem/progenitor cells, but not in terminally differentiated cells. We identified âˆ¼15 million piRNAs associated with Hywi and/or Hyli and found that they exhibit the ping-pong signature of piRNA biogenesis. Hydra PIWI proteins are strictly cytoplasmic and thus likely act as posttranscriptional regulators. To explore this function, we generated a Hydra transcriptome for piRNA mapping. piRNAs map to transposons with a 25- to 35-fold enrichment compared with the abundance of transposon transcripts. By sequencing the small RNAs specific to the interstitial, ectodermal, and endodermal lineages, we found that the targeting of transposons appears to be largely restricted to the interstitial lineage. We also identified putative nontransposon targets of the pathway unique to each lineage. Finally we demonstrate that hywi function is essential in the somatic epithelial lineages. This comprehensive analysis of the PIWI-piRNA pathway in the somatic stem/progenitor cells of a nonbilaterian animal suggests that this pathway originated with broader stem cell functionality."

We encourage researchers to test and report their techniques against these data. Standard analysis sets of volumetric scans from ADNI-1 have been created, comprising screening visits, 1-year completers (subjects who all have screening, 6- and 12-month scans), 2-year annual completers (screening, 1-year and 2-year scans), 2-year completers (screening, 6-months, 1-year, 18-months [mild cognitive impaired (MCI) only], and 2-year scans), and complete visits (screening, 6-month, 1-year, 18-month [MCI only], 2-year, and 3-year [normal and MCI only] scans).

A limitation of the use of baculoviruses for pest control is that their efficacy is modifiable by host-plant chemicals. The levels of phenolic substrates and two foliar oxidative enzymes, peroxidase(POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PTO), were significant predictors of disease caused by a baculovirus in Heliothis virescens fed on either cotton or lettuce; POD was the more influential of the two enzymes. The higher the plant phenolase activity, the lower the percent mortality and the slower the insects died from viral infection. Whether a particular class of phenolic substrates was correlated with enhanced or attenuated baculoviral disease depended upon context, i.e.. admixture. Diminution of viral efficacy by plant oxidative activity may compromise the compatibility of baculoviruses with other components of an integrated pest management system such as host plant resistance."

Ascending auditory information courses through these structures via topographic axonal projections. Little is known about the molecular composition of projection neurons or their postsynaptic targets. To visualize axodendritic contacts between identified cell types, we used double-label immunohistochemistry, in vivo retrograde tracing, in vitro anterograde tracing, high-resolution confocal microscopy, three-dimensional reconstruction and fly-through visualization. We discovered a major class of IC neurons that strongly expressed calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II, alpha subunit (CaMKII). The distribution of these cells within the IC was mostly restricted to the external nucleus of the IC (ICX), in which the auditory space map is assembled. A large proportion of ICX-OT projection neurons were CaMKII positive. In addition to being the principal outputs, CaMKII cells were in direct contact with axonal boutons emanating from the main source of input to ICX, the lateral shell of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICCls). Numerous sites of putative synaptic contact were found on the somata, proximal dendrites, and distal dendrites. Double-label immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the existence of synapses between ICCls axons and the dendrites of CaMKII cells. Collectively, our data indicate that CaMKII ICX neurons are a cellular locus for the computation of auditory space-specific responses. Because the ICCls-ICX projection is physically altered during experience-dependent plasticity, these results lay the groundwork for probing microanatomical rearrangements that may underlie plasticity and learning."

"LLOYD, Kevin C",Luminal glucose concentrations in the gut under normal conditions,"Luminal glucose (Glc) concentrations in the small intestine (SI) are widely assumed to be 50-500 mM. These values have posed problems for interpreting SI luminal osmolality and absorptive capacity, Glc transporter Michaelis-Menten constants (K(m)), and the physiological role of active Glc transport and its regulation. Hence we measured luminal contents, osmolality, and Glc, Na+, and K+ concentrations in normally feeding rats, rabbits, and dogs. Measured Glc concentrations were compatible with the portion of measured osmolality not accounted for by Na+ and K+ salts, amino acids, and peptides. Mean SI luminal osmolalities were â‰¤100 mosmol/kg hypertonic. For animals on the most nearly physiological diets, SI Glc concentrations averaged 0.4-24 mM and ranged with time and SI region from 0.2 to a maximum of 48 mM. The older published very high values are artifacts of direct infusion of concentrated Glc solutions into the gut, nonspecific Glc assays, and failure to test for quantitative recovery or to centrifuge samples in the cold. By storing food after meals and releasing it between meals, rat stomach greatly damps diurnal fluctuations in quantity and osmolality of food reaching the SI and hence also damps fluctuations in absorption rates. These new values for luminal Glc have five important physiological implications: the problem of accounting for apparently very hypertonic SI contents in the face of high osmotic water permeability disappears; the effective K(m) of the SI Glc transporter is now comparable to prevailing Glc concentrations; the SI no longer appears to have enormous excess absorptive capacity for Glc; regulation of Glc transport by dietary intake now makes functional sense; and the claim that high luminal Glc concentrations permit solvent drag to become the major mode of Glc absorption under normal conditions is undermined."

"PUSTERLA, Nicola",Species-specificity of equine and porcine Lawsonia intracellularis isolates in laboratory animals.,"Lawsonia intracellularis infection causes proliferative enteropathy (PE) in many mammalian species, with porcine and equine proliferative enteropathy (PPE and EPE) known worldwide. Hamsters are a well-published animal model for PPE infection studies in pigs. There is no laboratory animal model for EPE infection studies and it is not known whether there is species-specificity for equine or porcine isolates of L. intracellularis in animal models. The objective of this study was to determine whether it is possible to generate typical EPE lesions in hamsters after inoculation with an equine strain of L. intracellularis (EPE strain) and whether it is comparatively possible to generate PPE lesions in rabbits after inoculation with a porcine strain of L. intracellularis (PPE strain). In 2 separate trials, 4-week-old and 3-week-old weanling golden Syrian hamsters were challenged with EPE strains and compared to uninfected (both trials) and PPE-infected controls (Trial 2 only). Concurrently, 6 female New Zealand white juvenile rabbits were infected with PPE strain and observed concomitantly to 8 similar rabbits infected with EPE strain for a different experiment. Hamsters and rabbits were observed for 21 to 24 days post-infection (DPI), depending on the experiment. Neither infected species developed clinical signs. The presence of disease was assessed with diagnostic techniques classically used for pigs and horses: immune-peroxidase monolayer assay on sera; quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection of molecular DNA in feces; and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on intestinal tissues. Our results showed that EPE-challenged hamsters do not develop infection when compared with PPE controls (IHC, P = 0.009; qPCR, P = 0.0003). Conversely, PPE-challenged rabbits do not develop typical intestinal lesions in comparison to EPE-challenged rabbits, with serological response at 14 DPI being significantly lower (P = 0.0023). In conclusion, PPE and EPE strains appear to have different host-specificities for hamsters and rabbits, respectively."

"KELLY, Maggi",Remote sensing of vegetation growth on a restored wetland,"Wetlands provide numerous ecological benefits to estuarine systems, creating incentives for restoration. Restoration success often depends on the speed to which the wetland site regains vegetation cover. Consequently, this study focused on restoration in the tidal marsh in the San Francisco Bay area known as Pond2a, on the Napa River. Remotely sensed imagery was used to map the change in vegetation cover after restoration. Imagery was highresolution (0.2m x 0.2m pixel) color-infrared aerial photography for 2003-2004. For both years, we utilized NDVI enhancement and determined a range of NDVI thresholds that differentiated between vegetation and non-vegetation. We then computed estimates of vegetation growth (or loss) for the ultimate NDVI threshold for Pond2a, for 2003- 2004. Estimates using different thresholds for the same image were compared to elucidate the dependency of area calculation on threshold chosen. Patterns of vegetation growth for each year were observed and interpreted using the ultimate threshold calculated and an accuracy assessment test was conducted based on field data. There was an increase in vegetation growth from 2003-2004, representing the success of restoration. As a result, this study provides utility for others interested in wetland restoration monitoring."

In this chapter, electrospun fibrous chitosan (CS) membranes modified with polyelectrolytes (polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI)) were used as sensing materials coated on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) for humidity detection. A series of nanofibrous membranes containing polyelectrolytes are fabricated on QCM and characterized regarding their morphology, sensitivity and hysteresis. Sensing experiments are carried out by measuring the resonance frequency shifts of QCM due to the additional mass loading. The results indicated that the response of the sensors increased by three to four orders of magnitude with increasing the relative humidity (RH) from 8 to 95% at room temperature, exhibiting high sensitivity and that, in the range of 20-95% RH, the Log(Î”f) showed a good linearity. Additionally, the prepared sensors exhibited remarkably enhanced sensitivity with increasing the coating loads of polyelectrolytes on QCM. Furthermore, the dynamic Langmuir adsorption model was used to determine the kinetic parameters such as adsorption rates and Gibbs free energy for various RH between 70 and 95%.

This competition was designed to physically demonstrate aspects of PEER's performance-based earthquake engineering methodology, and to educate and stimulate engineering undergraduate students via a hands-on project in a team environment. Teams design a balsa wood model of a multi-level commercial office structure that is subjected to a sequence of scaled ground motions from El Centro, Northridge and Kobe earthquakes, and the motion sequence corresponds to increasing spectral accelerations in the range of natural periods anticipated for the structures. Models are tested on a University Consortium on Instructional Shake Tables (UCIST) shaking table with simulated weights attached to each level. Accelerations are measured at the roof and base of the structure, and are subsequently processed to obtain measurements of engineering demand parameters (EDP's) that are correlated deterministically with dollar loss. Seismic performance is scored based on annual building revenue, which accounts for rent income, construction cost, and annual seismic cost. Three competitions have been held to date, two of which were sponsored by PEER, and the third sponsored by the Multi-Disciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research (MCEER)."

We first use 22,833 sets of orthologs from the nuclear genomes of 101 genera across land plants to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships. One of the more salient results is the resolution of some enigmatic relationships in seed plant phylogeny, such as the placement of Gnetales as sister to the rest of the gymnosperms. In using this novel phylogenomic approach, we were also able to identify overrepresented functional gene ontology categories in genes that provide positive branch support for major nodes prompting new hypotheses for genes associated with the diversification of angiosperms. For example, RNA interference (RNAi) has played a significant role in the divergence of monocots from other angiosperms, which has experimental support in Arabidopsis and rice. This analysis also implied that the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase IV and V (NRPD2) played a prominent role in the divergence of gymnosperms. This hypothesis is supported by the lack of 24nt siRNA in conifers, the maternal control of small RNA in the seeds of flowering plants, and the emergence of double fertilization in angiosperms. Our approach takes advantage of genomic data to define orthologs, reconstruct relationships, and narrow down candidate genes involved in plant evolution within a phylogenomic view of species' diversification."

"WULFF, Heike",Blocking KCa3.1 Channels Increases Tumor Cell Killing by a Subpopulation of Human Natural Killer Lymphocytes,"Natural killer (NK) cells are large granular lymphocytes that participate in both innate and adaptive immune responses against tumors and pathogens. They are also involved in other conditions, including organ rejection, graft-versus-host disease, recurrent spontaneous abortions, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. We demonstrate that human NK cells express the potassium channels Kv1.3 and KCa3.1. Expression of these channels does not vary with expression levels of maturation markers but varies between adherent and non-adherent NK cell subpopulations. Upon activation by mitogens or tumor cells, adherent NK (A-NK) cells preferentially up-regulate KCa3.1 and non-adherent (NA-NK) cells preferentially up-regulate Kv1.3. Consistent with this different phenotype, A-NK and NA-NK do not display the same sensitivity to the selective KCa3.1 blockers TRAM-34 and NS6180 and to the selective Kv1.3 blockers ShK-186 and PAP-1 in functional assays. Kv1.3 block inhibits the proliferation and degranulation of NA-NK cells with minimal effects on A-NK cells. In contrast, blocking KCa3.1 increases the degranulation and cytotoxicity of A-NK cells, but not of NA-NK cells. TRAM-34, however, does not affect their ability to form conjugates with target tumor cells, to migrate, or to express chemokine receptors. TRAM-34 and NS6180 also increase the proliferation of both A-NK and NA-NK cells. This results in a TRAM-34-induced increased ability of A-NK cells to reduce in vivo tumor growth. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting KCa3.1 on NK cells with selective blockers may be beneficial in cancer immunotherapy."

"MAZET, Jonna A",Using Molecular Epidemiology to Track Toxoplasma gondii from Terrestrial Carnivores to Marine Hosts: Implications for Public Health and Conservation,"BackgroundEnvironmental transmission of the zoonotic parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which is shed only by felids, poses risks to human and animal health in temperate and tropical ecosystems. Atypical T. gondii genotypes have been linked to severe disease in people and the threatened population of California sea otters. To investigate land-to-sea parasite transmission, we screened 373 carnivores (feral domestic cats, mountain lions, bobcats, foxes, and coyotes) for T. gondii infection and examined the distribution of genotypes in 85 infected animals sampled near the sea otter range.Methodology/principal findingsNested PCR-RFLP analyses and direct DNA sequencing at six independent polymorphic genetic loci (B1, SAG1, SAG3, GRA6, L358, and Apico) were used to characterize T. gondii strains in infected animals. Strains consistent with Type X, a novel genotype previously identified in over 70% of infected sea otters and four terrestrial wild carnivores along the California coast, were detected in all sampled species, including domestic cats. However, odds of Type X infection were 14 times higher (95% CI: 1.3-148.6) for wild felids than feral domestic cats. Type X infection was also linked to undeveloped lands (OR = 22, 95% CI: 2.3-250.7). A spatial cluster of terrestrial Type II infection (P = 0.04) was identified in developed lands bordering an area of increased risk for sea otter Type II infection. Two spatial clusters of animals infected with strains consistent with Type X (P â‰¤ 0.01) were detected in less developed landscapes.ConclusionsDifferences in T. gondii genotype prevalence among domestic and wild felids, as well as the spatial distribution of genotypes, suggest co-existing domestic and wild T. gondii transmission cycles that likely overlap at the interface of developed and undeveloped lands. Anthropogenic development driving contact between these cycles may increase atypical T. gondii genotypes in domestic cats and facilitate transmission of potentially more pathogenic genotypes to humans, domestic animals, and wildlife."

"HARTIGAN-O'CONNOR, Dennis J",Breast-fed and bottle-fed infant rhesus macaques develop distinct gut microbiotas and immune systems,"Diet has a strong influence on the intestinal microbiota in both humans and animal models. It is well established that microbial colonization is required for normal development of the immune system and that specific microbial constituents prompt the differentiation or expansion of certain immune cell subsets. Nonetheless, it has been unclear how profoundly diet might shape the primate immune system or how durable the influence might be. We show that breast-fed and bottle-fed infant rhesus macaques develop markedly different immune systems, which remain different 6 months after weaning when the animals begin receiving identical diets. In particular, breast-fed infants develop robust populations of memory T cells as well as T helper 17 (TH17) cells within the memory pool, whereas bottle-fed infants do not. These findings may partly explain the variation in human susceptibility to conditions with an immune basis, as well as the variable protection against certain infectious diseases."
"WAN, Yu-Jui Yvonne",All-trans retinoic acid regulates hepatic bile acid homeostasis,"Retinoic acid (RA) and bile acids share common roles in regulating lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. In addition, the receptor for RA (retinoid x receptor) is a permissive partner of the receptor for bile acids, farnesoid x receptor (FXR/NR1H4). Thus, RA can activate the FXR-mediated pathway as well. The current study was designed to understand the effect of all-trans RA on bile acid homeostasis. Mice were fed an all-trans RA-supplemented diet and the expression of 46 genes that participate in regulating bile acid homeostasis was studied. The data showed that all-trans RA has a profound effect in regulating genes involved in synthesis and transport of bile acids. All-trans RA treatment reduced the gene expression levels of Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, and Akr1d1, which are involved in bile acid synthesis. All-trans RA also decreased the hepatic mRNA levels of Lrh-1 (Nr5a2) and Hnf4Î± (Nr2a1), which positively regulate the gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1. Moreover, all-trans RA induced the gene expression levels of negative regulators of bile acid synthesis including hepatic Fgfr4, Fxr, and Shp (Nr0b2) as well as ileal Fgf15. All-trans RA also decreased the expression of Abcb11 and Slc51b, which have a role in bile acid transport. Consistently, all-trans RA reduced hepatic bile acid levels and the ratio of CA/CDCA, as demonstrated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data suggest that all-trans RA-induced SHP may contribute to the inhibition of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, which in turn reduces bile acid synthesis and affects lipid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract."

A high-throughput immunoassay would allow for monitoring of human and environmental exposures as a part of risk assessment. Naturally occurring antibodies in camelids that are devoid of light chain, show great promise as an efficient tool in monitoring environmental contaminants, but they have been rarely used for small molecules. An alpaca was immunized with a TBBPA hapten coupled to thyroglobulin and a variable domain of heavy chain antibody (VHH) T3-15 highly selective for TBBPA was isolated from a phage displayed VHH library using heterologous coating antigens. Compared to the VHHs isolated using homologous antigens, VHH T3-15 had about a 10-fold improvement in sensitivity in an immunoassay. This assay, under the optimized conditions of 10% methanol in the assay buffer (pH 7.4), had an IC50 for TBBPA of 0.40 ng mL(-1) and negligible cross reactivity (<0.1%) with other tested analogues. After heating the VHH at 90 Â°C for 90 min about 20% of the affinity for coating antigen T3-BSA remained. The recoveries of TBBPA from spiked soil and fetal bovine serum samples ranged from 90.3% to 110.7% by ELISA and agreed well with a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. We conclude the many advantages of VHH make them attractive for the development of immunoassays to small molecules."

"VAN ROMPAY, Koen K",Sequential emergence and clinical implications of viral mutants with K70E and K65R mutation in reverse transcriptase during prolonged tenofovir monotherapy in rhesus macaques with chronic RT-SHIV infection,"BackgroundWe reported previously on the emergence and clinical implications of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac251) mutants with a K65R mutation in reverse transcriptase (RT), and the role of CD8+ cell-mediated immune responses in suppressing viremia during tenofovir therapy. Because of significant sequence differences between SIV and HIV-1 RT that affect drug susceptibilities and mutational patterns, it is unclear to what extent findings with SIV can be extrapolated to HIV-1 RT. Accordingly, to model HIV-1 RT responses, 12 macaques were inoculated with RT-SHIV, a chimeric SIV containing HIV-1 RT, and started on prolonged tenofovir therapy 5 months later.ResultsThe early virologic response to tenofovir correlated with baseline viral RNA levels and expression of the MHC class I allele Mamu-A*01. For all animals, sensitive real-time PCR assays detected the transient emergence of K70E RT mutants within 4 weeks of therapy, which were then replaced by K65R mutants within 12 weeks of therapy. For most animals, the occurrence of these mutations preceded a partial rebound of plasma viremia to levels that remained on average 10-fold below baseline values. One animal eventually suppressed K65R viremia to undetectable levels for more than 4 years; sequential experiments using CD8+ cell depletion and tenofovir interruption demonstrated that both CD8+ cells and continued tenofovir therapy were required for sustained suppression of viremia.ConclusionThis is the first evidence that tenofovir therapy can select directly for K70E viral mutants in vivo. The observations on the clinical implications of the K65R RT-SHIV mutants were consistent with those of SIVmac251, and suggest that for persons infected with K65R HIV-1 both immune-mediated and drug-dependent antiviral activities play a role in controlling viremia. These findings suggest also that even in the presence of K65R virus, continuation of tenofovir treatment as part of HAART may be beneficial, particularly when assisted by antiviral immune responses."

The five most accurate tracers followed the HarP to segment 15 ADNI cases acquired at three time points on both 1.5 T and 3T.ResultsThe agreement among tracers was relatively low with the local protocols (absolute left/right ICC 0.44/0.43) and much higher with the HarP (absolute left/right ICC 0.88/0.89). On the larger set of 15 cases, the HarP agreement within (left/right ICC range: 0.94/0.95 to 0.99/0.99) and among tracers (left/right ICC range: 0.89/0.90) was very high. The volume variance due to different tracers was 0.9% of the total, comparing favorably to variance due to scanner manufacturer (1.2), atrophy rates (3.5), hemispheric asymmetry (3.7), field strength (4.4), and significantly smaller than the variance due to atrophy (33.5%, P < .001), and physiological variability (49.2%, P < .001).ConclusionsThe HarP has high measurement stability compared with local segmentation protocols, and good reproducibility within and among human tracers. Hippocampi segmented with the HarP can be used as a reference for the qualification of human tracers and automated segmentation algorithms."

Moreover, there are presently no methods to track the flow of mobile DNA elements such as plasmids through communities or to determine which of these are co-localized within the same cell. We address these limitations by applying Hi-C, a technology originally designed for the study of three-dimensional genome structure in eukaryotes, to measure the cellular co-localization of DNA sequences. We leveraged Hi-C data generated from a simple synthetic metagenome sample to accurately cluster metagenome assembly contigs into groups that contain nearly complete genomes of each species. The Hi-C data also reliably associated plasmids with the chromosomes of their host and with each other. We further demonstrated that Hi-C data provides a long-range signal of strain-specific genotypes, indicating such data may be useful for high-resolution genotyping of microbial populations. Our work demonstrates that Hi-C sequencing data provide valuable information for metagenome analyses that are not currently obtainable by other methods. This metagenomic Hi-C method could facilitate future studies of the fine-scale population structure of microbes, as well as studies of how antibiotic resistance plasmids (or other genetic elements) mobilize in microbial communities. The method is not limited to microbiology; the genetic architecture of other heterogeneous populations of cells could also be studied with this technique."

Next, we used genetic approaches to verify the functionality and molecular mechanism of phospho-MARCKS. Finally, cancer cells were pharmacologically inhibited for MARCKS activity and subjected to functional bioassays.We demonstrated that higher phospho-MARCKS levels were correlated with shorter overall survival of lung cancer patients. Using shRNA silencing and ectopic expression of wild-type and PSD-mutated (S159/163A) MARCKS, we showed that elevated phospho-MARCKS promoted cancer growth and erlotinib resistance. Further studies demonstrated an interaction of phosphoinositide 3-kinase with MARCKS, but not with phospho-MARCKS. Interestingly, phospho-MARCKS acted in parallel with increased phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate pools and AKT activation in cells. Through treatment with a 25-mer peptide targeting the MARCKS PSD motif (MPS peptide), we were able to suppress tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, and reduced levels of phospho-MARCKS, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, and AKT activity. This peptide also enhanced the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to erlotinib treatment, especially those with sustained activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling.These results suggest a key role for MARCKS PSD in cancer disease and provide a unique strategy for inhibiting the activity of MARCKS PSD as a treatment for lung cancer."
"HEYER, Wolf D",The Mus81-Mms4 structure-selective endonuclease requires nicked DNA junctions to undergo conformational changes and bend its DNA substrates for cleavage,"Mus81-Mms4/EME1 is a DNA structure-selective endonuclease that cleaves joint DNA molecules that form during homologous recombination in mitotic and meiotic cells. Here, we demonstrate by kinetic analysis using physically tethered DNA substrates that budding yeast Mus81-Mms4 requires inherent rotational flexibility in DNA junctions for optimal catalysis. FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer experiments further reveal that recognition of 3'-flap and nicked Holliday junction substrates by Mus81-Mms4 involves induction of a sharp bend with a 100Â° angle between two duplex DNA arms. In addition, thiol crosslinking of Mus81-Mms4 bound to DNA junctions demonstrates that the heterodimer undergoes a conformational change induced by joint DNA molecules with preferred structural properties. The results from all three approaches suggest a model for catalysis by Mus81-Mms4 in which initial DNA binding is based on minimal structural requirements followed by a rate-limiting conformational transition of the substrate and protein. This leads to a sharply kinked DNA molecule that may fray the DNA four base pairs away from the junction point to position the nuclease for cleavage between the fourth and fifth nucleotide. These data suggest that mutually compatible conformational changes of Mus81-Mms4 and its substrates tailor its incision activity to nicked junction molecules."
"ZHANG, Jin",Glycogen synthase kinase 3 promotes p53 mRNA translation via phosphorylation of RNPC1,"The RNPC1 RNA-binding protein, also called Rbm38, is a target of p53 and a repressor of p53 mRNA translation. Thus, the p53-RNPC1 loop is critical for modulating p53 tumor suppression, but it is not clear how the loop is regulated. Here, we showed that RNPC1 is phosphorylated at Ser195 by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). We also showed that GSK3 promotes p53 mRNA translation through phosphorylation of RNPC1. Interestingly, we found that the phosphor-mimetic mutant S195D and the deletion mutant Î”189-204, which lacks the GSK3 phosphorylation site, are unable to repress p53 mRNA translation due to loss of interaction with eukaryotic translation factor eIF4E on p53 mRNA. Additionally, we found that phosphorylated RNPC1, RNPC1-S195D, and RNPC1(Î”189-204) promote p53 mRNA translation through interaction with eukaryotic translation factor eIF4G, which then facilitates the assembly of the eIF4F complex on p53 mRNA. Furthermore, we showed that upon inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway, GSK3 is activated, leading to increased RNPC1 phosphorylation and increased p53 expression in a RNPC1-dependent manner. Together, we postulate that the p53-RNPC1 loop can be explored to increase or decrease p53 activity for cancer therapy."
"CANTER, Robert J",Perioperative radiotherapy is associated with improved survival among patients with synovial sarcoma: A SEER analysis,"Â© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Background and Methods: We examined the outcomes of synovial sarcoma (SS) patients in a national database. We identified 1,189 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database with data on site and extent of surgery. We excluded patients diagnosed before 1990, &#60;18 years, or lacking pathologic confirmation. Using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses, we determined predictors of overall (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Results: The mean age was 41, 49.3% were female, and 82.2% were white. Radiotherapy (RT) was administered to 57.5%. On multivariable analysis, age at diagnosis, sex, race, anatomic site, SEER summary stage, tumor size, surgery type, and RT predicted OS. Similar predictors of DSS were identified. The hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.65 (95% CI 0.48-0.88) in favor of RT and 0.62 (95% CI 0.45-0.86) for DSS. Five-year OS improved 8.4Â±1.0% with RT (P=0.003), and five-year DSS improved 7.7Â±1.0% with RT (P=0.015). Conclusions: In the largest study to date examining the role of RT in synovial sarcoma, we observed that RT was associated with a statistically significant improvement in oncologic outcome among SS patients. These data support the use of RT in the multi-modality treatment of patients with SS."

We report the discovery of such a system. In Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we have found four images of a single supernova forming an Einstein cross configuration around a redshift z = 0.54 elliptical galaxy in the MACS J1149.6+2223 cluster. The cluster's gravitational potential also creates multiple images of the z = 1.49 spiral supernova host galaxy, and a future appearance of the supernova elsewhere in the cluster field is expected. The magnifications and staggered arrivals of the supernova images probe the cosmic expansion rate, as well as the distribution of matter in the galaxy and cluster lenses."

Alternative inclusion of MECP2/Mecp2 exon 1 with exons 3 and 4 encodes MeCP2-e1 or MeCP2-e2 protein isoforms with unique amino termini. While most MECP2 mutations are located in exons 3 and 4 thus affecting both isoforms, MECP2 exon 1 mutations but not exon 2 mutations have been identified in RTT patients, suggesting that MeCP2-e1 deficiency is sufficient to cause RTT. As expected, genetic deletion of Mecp2 exons 3 and/or 4 recapitulates RTT-like neurologic defects in mice. However, Mecp2 exon 2 knockout mice have normal neurologic function. Here, a naturally occurring MECP2 exon 1 mutation is recapitulated in a mouse model by genetic engineering. A point mutation in the translational start codon of Mecp2 exon 1, transmitted through the germline, ablates MeCP2-e1 translation while preserving MeCP2-e2 production in mouse brain. The resulting MeCP2-e1 deficient mice developed forelimb stereotypy, hindlimb clasping, excessive grooming and hypo-activity prior to death between 7 and 31 weeks. MeCP2-e1 deficient mice also exhibited abnormal anxiety, sociability and ambulation. Despite MeCP2-e1 and MeCP2-e2 sharing, 96% amino acid identity, differences were identified. A fraction of phosphorylated MeCP2-e1 differed from the bulk of MeCP2 in subnuclear localization and co-factor interaction. Furthermore, MeCP2-e1 exhibited enhanced stability compared with MeCP2-e2 in neurons. Therefore, MeCP2-e1 deficient mice implicate MeCP2-e1 as the sole contributor to RTT with non-redundant functions."

Here, we report that after cell irradiation, MKP1 translocates into mitochondria, where it prevents apoptotic induction by limiting accumulation of phosphorylated active forms of the stress kinase JNK. Increased levels of mitochondrial MKP1 after irradiation occurred in the mitochondrial inner membrane space. Notably, cell survival regulated by mitochondrial MKP1 was responsible for conferring radioresistance in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, due to the fact that MKP1 serves as a major downstream effector in the HER2-activated RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. Clinically, we documented MKP1 expression exclusively in HER2-positive breast tumors, relative to normal adjacent tissue from the same patients. MKP1 overexpression was also detected in irradiated HER2-positive breast cancer stem-like cells (HER2(+)/CD44(+)/CD24(-/low)) isolated from a radioresistant breast cancer cell population after long-term radiation treatment. MKP1 silencing reduced clonogenic survival and enhanced radiosensitivity in these stem-like cells. Combined inhibition of MKP1 and HER2 enhanced cell killing in breast cancer. Together, our findings identify a new mechanism of resistance in breast tumors and reveal MKP1 as a novel therapeutic target for radiosensitization."

Here we test the hypothesis that gut microbial transplantation can transmit choline diet-induced TMAO production and atherosclerosis susceptibility. First, a strong association was noted between atherosclerotic plaque and plasma TMAO levels in a mouse diversity panel (n = 22 strains, r = 0.38; p = 0.0001). An atherosclerosis-prone and high TMAO-producing strain, C57BL/6J, and an atherosclerosis-resistant and low TMAO-producing strain, NZW/LacJ, were selected as donors for cecal microbial transplantation into apolipoprotein e null mice in which resident intestinal microbes were first suppressed with antibiotics. Trimethylamine (TMA) and TMAO levels were initially higher in recipients on choline diet that received cecal microbes from C57BL/6J inbred mice; however, durability of choline diet-dependent differences in TMA/TMAO levels was not maintained to the end of the study. Mice receiving C57BL/6J cecal microbes demonstrated choline diet-dependent enhancement in atherosclerotic plaque burden as compared with recipients of NZW/LacJ microbes. Microbial DNA analyses in feces and cecum revealed transplantation of donor microbial community features into recipients with differences in taxa proportions between donor strains that were transmissible to recipients and that tended to show coincident proportions with TMAO levels. Proportions of specific taxa were also identified that correlated with plasma TMAO levels in donors and recipients and with atherosclerotic lesion area in recipients. Atherosclerosis susceptibility may be transmitted via transplantation of gut microbiota. Gut microbes may thus represent a novel therapeutic target for modulating atherosclerosis susceptibility."

Baseline morphologic cartilage 3T MRI readings (WORMS scoring) and T2 measurements (resolution = 0.313 mm Ã— 0.446 mm) were performed in the medial and lateral femurs, medial and lateral tibias, and patella compartments. To create a reference database, a logarithmic transformation was applied to the data to obtain the 5th-95th percentile values for T2.ResultsSignificant differences in mean cartilage T2 values were observed between joint compartments. Although females had slightly higher T2 values than males in a majority of compartments, the differences were only significant in the medial femur (P < 0.0001). A weak positive association was seen between age and T2 in all compartments, most pronounced in the patella (3.27% increase in median T2/10 years, P = 0.009). Significant associations between BMI and T2 were observed, most pronounced in the lateral tibia (5.33% increase in median T2/5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI, P < 0.0001), and medial tibia (4.81% increase in median T2 /5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI, P < 0.0001).ConclusionsThis study established the first reference database of T2 values in a large sample of morphologically normal cartilage plates in knees without radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA).

"MORISSEAU, Christophe H",Epoxide hydrolase activities and epoxy fatty acids in the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus,"Culex mosquitoes have emerged as important model organisms for mosquito biology, and are disease vectors for multiple mosquito-borne pathogens, including West Nile virus. We characterized epoxide hydrolase activities in the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, which suggested multiple forms of epoxide hydrolases were present. We found EH activities on epoxy eicosatrienoic acids (EETs). EETs and other eicosanoids are well-established lipid signaling molecules in vertebrates. We showed EETs can be synthesized in vitro from arachidonic acids by mosquito lysate, and EETs were also detected in vivo both in larvae and adult mosquitoes by LC-MS/MS. The EH activities on EETs can be induced by blood feeding, and the highest activity was observed in the midgut of female mosquitoes. The enzyme activities on EETs can be inhibited by urea-based inhibitors designed for mammalian soluble epoxide hydrolases (sEH). The sEH inhibitors have been shown to play diverse biological roles in mammalian systems, and they can be useful tools to study the function of EETs in mosquitoes. Besides juvenile hormone metabolism and detoxification, insect epoxide hydrolases may also play a role in regulating lipid signaling molecules, such as EETs and other epoxy fatty acids, synthesized in vivo or obtained from blood feeding by female mosquitoes."
"COMAI, Luca",Perturbation of Parentally Biased Gene Expression during Interspecific Hybridization,"Interspecific hybridization often induces epigenetic remodeling that leads to transposon activation, gene expression changes, and loss of imprinting. These genomic changes can be deleterious and contribute to postzygotic hybrid incompatibility. In Arabidopsis, loss of genomic imprinting of PHERES1 and presumed failure of Polycomb Repressive Complex contributes to seed inviability observed in A. thaliana X A. arenosa interspecific hybrids. We used this species pair to further analyze the relationship between parentally biased gene expression and postzygotic hybrid incompatibility using two A. thaliana accessions, Col-0 and C24, with differential seed survival. We found that parentally biased expression was perturbed to a similar degree in both A. thaliana hybrids for PHERES1, HDG3, and six other normally paternally expressed genes. We propose that early genome remodeling and loss of imprinting of seed development genes induces lethality in both compatible and incompatible hybrids."
"LANE, Nancy E",Are There Sex Differences in Knee Cartilage Composition and Walking Mechanics in Healthy and Osteoarthritis Populations?,"BackgroundWomen are at a greater risk for knee osteoarthritis (OA), but reasons for this greater risk in women are not well understood. It may be possible that differences in cartilage composition and walking mechanics are related to greater OA risk in women.Questions/purposes(1) Do women have higher knee cartilage and meniscus T1Ï than men in young healthy, middle-aged non-OA and OA populations? (2) Do women exhibit greater static and dynamic (during walking) knee loading than men in young healthy, middle-aged non-OA and OA populations?MethodsData were collected from three cohorts: (1) young active (<35 years) (20 men, 13 women); (2) middle-aged (â‰¥35 years) without OA (Kellgren-Lawrence [KL] grade < 2) (43 men, 65 women); and (3) middle-aged with OA (KL>1) (18 men, 25 women). T1Ï and T2 relaxation times for cartilage in the medial knee, lateral knee, and patellofemoral compartments and medial and lateral menisci were quantified with 3.0-T MRI. A subset of the participants underwent three-dimensional motion capture during walking for calculation of peak knee flexion and adduction moments, flexion and adduction impulses, and peak adduction angle. Differences in MR, radiograph, and gait parameters between men and women were compared in the three groups separately using multivariate analysis of variance.ResultsWomen had higher lateral articular cartilage T1Ï (men=40.5 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 38.8-42.3] ms; women=43.3 [95% CI, 41.9-44.7] ms; p=0.017) and patellofemoral T1Ï (men=44.4 [95% CI, 42.6-46.3] ms; women=48.4 [95% CI, 46.9-50.0] ms; p=0.002) in the OA group; and higher lateral meniscus T1Ï in the young group (men=15.3 [95% CI, 14.7-16.0] ms; women=16.4 [95% CI, 15.6-17.2] ms; p=0.045). The peak adduction moment in the second half of stance was lower in women in the middle-aged (men=2.05 [95% CI, 1.76-2.34] %BW*Ht; women=1.66 [95% CI, 1.44-1.89] %BW*Ht; p=0.037) and OA (men=2.34 [95% CI, 1.76-2.91] %BW*Ht; women=1.42 [95% CI, 0.89-1.94] %BW*Ht; p=0.022) groups. Static varus from radiographs was lower in women in the middle-aged (men=178Â° [95% CI, 177Â°-179Â°]; women=180Â° [95% CI, 179Â°-181Â°]; p=0.002) and OA (men=176Â° [95% CI, 175Â°-178Â°]; women=180Â° [95% CI, 179Â°-181Â°]; p<0.001) groups. Women had lower varus during walking in all three groups (young: men=4Â° [95% CI, 3Â°-6Â°]; women=2Â° [95% CI, 0Â°-3Â°]; p=0.013; middle-aged: men=2Â° [95% CI, 1Â°-3Â°]; women=0Â° [95% CI, -1Â° to 1Â°]; p=0.015; OA: men=4Â° [95% CI, 2Â°-6Â°]; women=0Â° [95% CI, -2Â° to 2Â°]; p=0.011). Women had a higher knee flexion moment (men=4.24 [95% CI, 3.58-4.91] %BW*Ht; women 5.40 [95% CI, 4.58-6.21] %BW*Ht; p=0.032) in the young group.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate differences in cartilage composition and gait mechanics between men and women in young healthy, middle-aged healthy, and OA cohorts. Considering the cross-sectional nature of the study, longitudinal research is needed to investigate if these differences in cartilage composition and walking mechanics are associated with a greater risk of lateral tibiofemoral or patellofemoral OA in women. Future studies should also investigate the relative risk of lateral versus medial patellofemoral cartilage degeneration risk in women compared with men.Level of evidenceLevel III, retrospective study."

However, when NA is used to treat dyslipidemias, it causes a strong side effect of cutaneous vasodilation, commonly called flushing. A recent study showed that NA may cause flushing by lowering activation threshold temperature of the heat-sensitive capsaicin receptor TRPV1 ion channel, leading to its activation at body temperature. The finding calls into question whether NA might also interact with the homologous heat-sensitive TRPV2-4 channels, particularly given that TRPV3 and TRPV4 are abundantly expressed in keratinocytes of the skin where much of the flushing response occurs. We found that NA indeed potentiated TRPV3 while inhibited TRPV2 and TRPV4. Consistent with these gating effects, NA lowered the heat-activation threshold of TRPV3 but elevated that of TRPV4. We further found that activity of TRPV1 was substantially prolonged by extracellular NA, which may further enhance the direct activation effect. Consistent with the broad gating effect on TRPV1-4 channels, evidence from the present study hints that NA may share the same activation pathway as 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), a common agonist for these TRPV channels. These findings shed new light on the molecular mechanism underlying NA regulation of TRPV channels."
"BROOKS, Rebecca A",Survival differences of Asian and Caucasian epithelial ovarian cancer patients in the United States,"Objective: To compare the racial differences in treatment and survival of Asian-Americans and White patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods: Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program between 1988 and 2009 and analyzed using Chi-squared tests, Kaplan-Meier methods, and Cox regression analysis. Results: Of the 52,260 women, 3932 (7.5%) were coded as Asian, and 48,328 (92.5%) were White. The median age of Asians at diagnosis was 56 vs. 64 years for the Whites (p < 0.001). Asians were more likely to undergo primary surgery, have an earlier stage of disease, have a diagnosis of a non-serous histology, and have lower grade tumors. The 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) of Asians was higher compared to Whites (59.1% vs. 47.3%, p < 0.001). On a subset analysis, Vietnamese, Filipino, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Asian Indian/Pakistani ethnicities had 5-year DSS of 62.1%, 61.5%, 61.0%, 59.0%, 54.6%, and 48.2%, respectively (p = 0.015). On multivariate analysis, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, race, surgery, stage, and tumor grade were all independent prognostic factors for survival. Asians were further stratified to U.S. born versus those who were born in Asia and immigrated. Asian immigrants presented at a younger age compared to U.S. born Asians. Immigrants were found to have an improved 5-year DSS when compared to U.S. born Asians and Whites of 55%, 52%, and 48%, respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Asians were more likely to be younger, undergo primary surgery, have an earlier stage of disease, non-serous histology, lower grade tumors, and higher survival."
"BRADAC, Marusa",THE GRISM LENS-AMPLIFIED SURVEY FROM SPACE (GLASS). II. GAS-PHASE METALLICITY AND RADIAL GRADIENTS IN AN INTERACTING SYSTEM AT Z â‰ƒ 2,"We present spatially resolved gas-phase metallicity for a system of three galaxies at z = 1.85 detected in the Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS). The combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST's) diffraction limit and strong gravitational lensing by the cluster MACS J0717+3745 results in a spatial resolution of â‰ƒ200-300 pc, enabling good spatial sampling despite the intrinsically small galaxy sizes. The galaxies in this system are separated by â‰ƒ50-200 kpc in projection and are likely in an early stage of interaction, evidenced by relatively high specific star formation rates. Their gas-phase metallicities are consistent with larger samples at similar redshift, star formation rate (SFR), and stellar mass. We obtain a precise measurement of the metallicity gradient for one galaxy and find a shallow slope compared to isolated galaxies at high redshift, consistent with a flattening of the gradient due to gravitational interaction. An alternative explanation for the shallow metallicity gradient and elevated SFR is rapid recycling of metal-enriched gas, but we find no evidence for enhanced gas-phase metallicities which should result from this effect. Notably, the measured stellar masses = 7.2-9.1 probe to an order of magnitude below previous mass-metallicity studies at this redshift. The lowest mass galaxy has properties similar to those expected for Fornax at this redshift, indicating that GLASS is able to directly study the progenitors of local group dwarf galaxies on spatially resolved scales. Larger samples from the full GLASS survey will be ideal for studying the effects of feedback, and the time evolution of metallicity gradients. These initial results demonstrate the utility of HST spectroscopy combined with gravitational lensing for characterizing resolved physical properties of galaxies at high redshift."

"WAETJEN, L Elaine E",Factors Associated With Seeking Treatment for Urinary Incontinence During the Menopausal Transition,"ObjectiveTo examine whether longitudinal urinary incontinence (UI) characteristics, race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and education were associated with UI treatment-seeking in a prospective cohort of community-dwelling midlife women.MethodsWe analyzed data from 9 years of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. The study asked participants reporting at least monthly UI about seeking treatment for their UI at baseline and in visit years 7, 8, and 9. Our main covariates included self-reported race or ethnicity, income, level of difficulty paying for basics, and education level. We used multiple logistic regression to examine associations between demographic, psychosocial, and longitudinal UI characteristics and whether women sought UI treatment. We explored interactions by race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status measures, and education level.ResultsA total of 1,550 women (68% of women with UI) reported seeking treatment for UI over the 9 years of this study. In multivariable analyses, women had higher odds of seeking treatment when UI in the year before seeking treatment was more frequent (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-8.67) and more bothersome (adjusted OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18), with longer symptom duration, and with worsening UI symptoms (adjusted OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.01-3.04). Women who saw physicians regularly, had more preventive women's health visits, or both were more likely to seek UI treatment (adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07, 1.30). Race or ethnicity, socioeconomic measures, and education were not significantly related to seeking treatment for UI.ConclusionWe found no evidence of racial or ethnic, socioeconomic, or education level disparities in UI treatment-seeking. Rather, longitudinal UI characteristics were most strongly associated with treatment-seeking behavior in midlife women.Level of evidenceII."
"RAFF, Gary W",Right ventricular nitric oxide signaling in an ovine model of congenital heart disease: a preserved fetal phenotype,"We recently reported superior right ventricle (RV) performance in response to acute afterload challenge in lambs with a model of congenital heart disease with chronic left-to-right cardiac shunts. Compared with control animals, shunt lambs demonstrated increased contractility because of an enhanced Anrep effect (the slow increase in contractility following myocyte stretch). This advantageous physiological response may reflect preservation of a fetal phenotype, since the RV of shunt lambs remains exposed to increased pressure postnatally. Nitric oxide (NO) production by NO synthase (NOS) is activated by myocyte stretch and is a necessary intermediary of the Anrep response. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that NO signaling is increased in the RV of fetal lambs compared with controls and shunt lambs have persistence of this fetal pattern. An 8-mm graft was placed between the pulmonary artery and aorta in fetal lambs (shunt). NOS isoform expression, activity, and association with activating cofactors were determined in fetal tissue obtained during late-gestation and in 4-wk-old juvenile shunt and control lambs. We demonstrated increased RNA and protein expression of NOS isoforms and increased total NOS activity in the RV of both shunt and fetal lambs compared with control. We also found increased NOS activation and association with cofactors in shunt and fetal RV compared with control. These data demonstrate preserved fetal NOS phenotype and NO signaling in shunt RV, which may partially explain the mechanism underlying the adaptive response to increased afterload seen in the RV of shunt lambs."

Ferritin is the major iron storage protein of the body; by using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of ferritin as an index, we explored whether brain iron status impacts longitudinal outcomes in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. We show that baseline CSF ferritin levels were negatively associated with cognitive performance over 7 years in 91 cognitively normal, 144 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 67 AD subjects, and predicted MCI conversion to AD. Ferritin was strongly associated with CSF apolipoprotein E levels and was elevated by the Alzheimer's risk allele, APOE-É›4. These findings reveal that elevated brain iron adversely impacts on AD progression, and introduce brain iron elevation as a possible mechanism for APOE-É›4 being the major genetic risk factor for AD."
"SINHA, Neelima",The genome of the stress-tolerant wild tomato species Solanum pennellii,"Solanum pennellii is a wild tomato species endemic to Andean regions in South America, where it has evolved to thrive in arid habitats. Because of its extreme stress tolerance and unusual morphology, it is an important donor of germplasm for the cultivated tomato Solanum lycopersicum. Introgression lines (ILs) in which large genomic regions of S. lycopersicum are replaced with the corresponding segments from S. pennellii can show remarkably superior agronomic performance. Here we describe a high-quality genome assembly of the parents of the IL population. By anchoring the S. pennellii genome to the genetic map, we define candidate genes for stress tolerance and provide evidence that transposable elements had a role in the evolution of these traits. Our work paves a path toward further tomato improvement and for deciphering the mechanisms underlying the myriad other agronomic traits that can be improved with S. pennellii germplasm."

"LIU, Hong",Role of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel-mediated PKC-Îµ in delayed protection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in isolated hearts of sevoflurane-preconditioned rats,"This study aimed to determine the role of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium (mitoKATP) channels and protein kinase C (PKC)-Îµ in the delayed protective effects of sevoflurane preconditioning using Langendorff isolated heart perfusion models. Fifty-four isolated perfused rat hearts were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=9). The rats were exposed for 60 min to 2.5% sevoflurane (the second window of protection group, SWOP group) or 33% oxygen inhalation (I/R group) 24 h before coronary occlusion. The control group (CON) and the sevoflurane group (SEVO) group were exposed to 33% oxygen and 2.5% sevoflurane for 60 min, respectively, without coronary occlusion. The mitoKATP channel inhibitor 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) was given 30 min before sevoflurane preconditioning (5-HD+SWOP group). Cardiac function indices, infarct sizes, serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations, and the expression levels of phosphorylated PKC-Îµ (p-PKC-Îµ) and caspase-8 were measured. Cardiac function was unchanged, p-PKC-Îµ expression was upregulated, caspase-8 expression was downregulated, cTnI concentrations were decreased, and the infarcts were significantly smaller (P<0.05) in the SWOP group compared with the I/R group. Cardiac function was worse, p-PKC-Îµ expression was downregulated, caspase-8 expression was upregulated, cTnI concentration was increased and infarcts were larger in the 5-HD+SWOP group (P<0.05) compared with the SWOP group. The results suggest that mitoKATP channels are involved in the myocardial protective effects of sevoflurane in preconditioning against I/R injury, by regulating PKC-Îµ phosphorylation before ischemia, and by downregulating caspase-8 during reperfusion."

The complete system incorporates both hardware components (including an embedded microcontroller, an odometry encoder, and an uncalibrated digital color camera) and software algorithms (including microcontroller algorithms and the proposed algorithm for tree crop enumeration) required to obtain robust performance in a natural outdoor environment. The enumeration system uses a three-step image analysis process based upon: (1) an orthographic plant projection method integrating a perspective transform with automatic parameter estimation; (2) a plant counting method based on projection histograms; and (3) a double-counting avoidance method based on a homography transform. Experimental results demonstrate the ability to count large numbers of plants automatically with no human effort. Results show that, for tree seedlings having a height up to 40 cm and a within-row tree spacing of approximately 10 cm, the algorithms successfully estimated the number of plants with an average accuracy of 95.2% for trees within a single image and 98% for counting of the whole plant population in a large sequence of images."

HRI is also a critical modifier of hemoglobin disorders such as Î²-thalassemia.

To expand the repertoire of chemotypes that activate HRI, we screened a âˆ¼1900 member N,N'-disubstituted urea library in the surrogate eIF2Î± phosphorylation assay, identifying N-aryl,N'-cyclohexylphenoxyurea as a promising scaffold. We validated hit compounds as a bona fide HRI activators in secondary assays and explored the contributions of substitutions on the N-aryl and N'-cyclohexylphenoxy groups to their activity by studying focused libraries of complementing analogues.

Given its proximity, it offers the best opportunity to date to study a thermonuclear supernova (SN) over a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Optical, near-IR, and mid-IR observations on the rising light curve, orchestrated by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory, show that SN 2014J is a spectroscopically normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), albeit exhibiting high-velocity features in its spectrum and heavily reddened by dust in the host galaxy. Our earliest detections start just hours after the fitted time of explosion. We use high-resolution optical spectroscopy to analyze the dense intervening material and do not detect any evolution in the resolved absorption features during the light curve rise. Similar to other highly reddened SNe Ia, a low value of total-to-selective extinction, RV â‰² 2, provides the best match to our observations. We also study pre-explosion optical and near-IR images from Hubble Space Telescope with special emphasis on the sources nearest to the SN location. Â© 2014. The American Astronomical Society.

"BLOOM, Arnold J",Increasing CO2 threatens human nutrition,"Dietary deficiencies of zinc and iron are a substantial global public health problem. An estimated two billion people suffer these deficiencies, causing a loss of 63â€‰million life-years annually. Most of these people depend on C3 grains and legumes as their primary dietary source of zinc and iron. Here we report that C3 grains and legumes have lower concentrations of zinc and iron when grown under field conditions at the elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration predicted for the middle of this century. C3 crops other than legumes also have lower concentrations of protein, whereas C4 crops seem to be less affected. Differences between cultivars of a single crop suggest that breeding for decreased sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 concentration could partly address these new challenges to global health."

Periodic action potentials (period 1) in healthy conditions bifurcate to other states such as period 2 or chaos when alternans or EADs occur in pathological conditions. The mechanisms of alternans and EADs have been extensively studied under steady-state conditions, but lethal arrhythmias often occur during the transition between steady states. Why arrhythmias tend to develop during the transition is unclear. We used low-dimensional mathematical models to analyze dynamical mechanisms of transient alternans and EADs. We show that depending on the route from one state to another, action potential alternans and EADs may occur during the transition between two periodic steady states. The route taken depends on the time course of external perturbations or intrinsic signaling, such as Î²-adrenergic stimulation, which regulate cardiac calcium and potassium currents with differential kinetics."

"KARP, Daniel S",Confronting and resolving competing values behind conservation objectives,"Diverse motivations for preserving nature both inspire and hinder its conservation. Optimal conservation strategies may differ radically depending on the objective. For example, creating nature reserves may prevent extinctions through protecting severely threatened species, whereas incentivizing farmland hedgerows may benefit people through bolstering pest-eating or pollinating species. Win-win interventions that satisfy multiple objectives are alluring, but can also be elusive. To achieve better outcomes, we developed and implemented a practical typology of nature conservation framed around seven common conservation objectives. Using an intensively studied bird assemblage in southern Costa Rica as a case study, we applied the typology in the context of biodiversity's most pervasive threat: habitat conversion. We found that rural habitats in a varied tropical landscape, comprising small farms, villages, forest fragments, and forest reserves, provided biodiversity-driven processes that benefit people, such as pollination, seed dispersal, and pest consumption. However, species valued for their rarity, endemism, and evolutionary distinctness declined in farmland. Conserving tropical forest on farmland increased species that international tourists value, but not species discussed in Costa Rican newspapers. Despite these observed trade-offs, our analyses also revealed promising synergies. For example, we found that maintaining forest cover surrounding farms in our study region would likely enhance most conservation objectives at minimal expense to others. Overall, our typology provides a framework for resolving the competing objectives of modern conservation."

In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed using the novel RNAscope 2.0 FFPE assay to localize the expression of Cfh mRNA in the mouse outer retina. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to localize Cfh protein expression, and western blots were used to characterize CFH antibodies used for IHC.ResultsCfh and Cfhr2 transcripts were detected in the mouse RPE/choroid using qPCR, while Cfhr1, Cfhr3, and Cfhrc (Gm4788) were not detected. ISH showed abundant Cfh mRNA in the RPE of all mouse strains (C57BL/6, BALB/c, 129/Sv) tested, with the exception of the Cfh(-/-) eye. Surprisingly, the Cfh protein was detected by immunohistochemistry in photoreceptors rather than in RPE cells. The specificity of the CFH antibodies was tested by western blotting. Our CFH antibodies recognized purified mouse Cfh protein, serum Cfh protein in wild-type C57BL/6, BALB/c, and 129/Sv, and showed an absence of the Cfh protein in the serum of Cfh(-/-) mice. Greatly reduced Cfh protein immunohistological signals in the Cfh(-/-) eyes also supported the specificity of the Cfh protein distribution results.ConclusionsOnly Cfh and Cfhr2 genes are expressed in the mouse outer retina. Only Cfh mRNA was detected in the RPE, but no protein. We hypothesize that the steady-state concentration of Cfh protein is low in the cells due to secretion, and therefore is below the detection level for IHC."

The hazardous nature of dry ice and liquid nitrogen, and the associated high shipping cost strongly limit their routine use. In this study, we tested the viability and properties of cells after being preserved or shipped over long distance in Matrigel mixture for different days. Our results showed that cells mixed with Matrigel at suitable ratios maintained excellent viability (>90%) for one week at room temperature and preserved the properties such as morphology, drug sensitivity and metabolism well, which was comparable to cells cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. We also sent cells in the Matrigel mixture via FedEx service to different places at ambient temperature. Upon arrival, it was found that over 90% of the cells were viable and grew well after replating. These data collectively suggested that our Matrigel-based method was highly convenient for shipping live cells for long distances in semi-solid gel condition and at ambient temperature."

"PENMETSA, Ramachandra V",Pigeonpea genomics initiative (PGI): an international effort to improve crop productivity of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.),"Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), an important food legume crop in the semi-arid regions of the world and the second most important pulse crop in India, has an average crop productivity of 780Â kg/ha. The relatively low crop yields may be attributed to non-availability of improved cultivars, poor crop husbandry and exposure to a number of biotic and abiotic stresses in pigeonpea growing regions. Narrow genetic diversity in cultivated germplasm has further hampered the effective utilization of conventional breeding as well as development and utilization of genomic tools, resulting in pigeonpea being often referred to as an â€˜orphan crop legumeâ€™. To enable genomics-assisted breeding in this crop, the pigeonpea genomics initiative (PGI) was initiated in late 2006 with funding from Indian Council of Agricultural Research under the umbrella of Indo-US agricultural knowledge initiative, which was further expanded with financial support from the US National Science Foundationâ€™s Plant Genome Research Program and the Generation Challenge Program. As a result of the PGI, the last 3Â years have witnessed significant progress in development of both genetic as well as genomic resources in this crop through effective collaborations and coordination of genomics activities across several institutes and countries. For instance, 25 mapping populations segregating for a number of biotic and abiotic stresses have been developed or are under development. An 11X-genome coverage bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library comprising of 69,120 clones have been developed of which 50,000 clones were end sequenced to generate 87,590 BAC-end sequences (BESs). About 10,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from Sanger sequencing and ca. 2Â million short ESTs by 454/FLX sequencing have been generated. A variety of molecular markers have been developed from BESs, microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR)-enriched libraries and mining of ESTs and genomic amplicon sequencing. Of about 21,000 SSRs identified, 6,698 SSRs are under analysis along with 670 orthologous genes using a GoldenGate SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping platform, with large scale SNP discovery using Solexa, a next generation sequencing technology, is in progress. Similarly a diversity array technology array comprising of ca. 15,000 features has been developed. In addition, >600 unique nucleotide binding site (NBS) domain containing members of the NBS-leucine rich repeat disease resistance homologs were cloned in pigeonpea; 960 BACs containing these sequences were identified by filter hybridization, BES physical maps developed using high information content fingerprinting. To enrich the genomic resources further, sequenced soybean genome is being analyzed to establish the anchor points between pigeonpea and soybean genomes. In addition, Solexa sequencing is being used to explore the feasibility of generating whole genome sequence. In summary, the collaborative efforts of several research groups under the umbrella of PGI are making significant progress in improving molecular tools in pigeonpea and should significantly benefit pigeonpea genetics and breeding. As these efforts come to fruition, and expanded (depending on funding), pigeonpea would move from an â€˜orphan legume cropâ€™ to one where genomics-assisted breeding approaches for a sustainable crop improvement are routine."
"TONEY, Michael D",Directed evolution of the substrate specificity of dialkylglycine decarboxylase,"Dialkylglycine decarboxylase (DGD) is an unusual pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzyme that catalyzes decarboxylation in the first and transamination in the second half-reaction of its ping-pong catalytic cycle. Directed evolution was employed to alter the substrate specificity of DGD from 2-aminoisobutyrate (AIB) to 1-aminocyclohexane-1-carboxylate (AC6C). Four rounds of directed evolution led to the identification of several mutants, with clones in the final rounds containing five persistent mutations. The best clones show ~2.5-fold decrease in KM and ~2-fold increase in kcat, giving a modest ~5-fold increase in catalytic efficiency for AC6C. Additional rounds of directed evolution did not improve catalytic activity toward AC6C. Only one (S306F) of the five persistent mutations is close to the active site. S306F was observed in all 33 clones except one, and the mutation is shown to stabilize the enzyme toward denaturation. The other four persistent mutations are near the surface of the enzyme. The S306F mutation and the distal mutations all have significant effects on the kinetic parameters for AIB and AC6C. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the mutations alter the conformational landscape of the enzyme, favoring a more open active site conformation that facilitates the reactivity of the larger substrate. We speculate that the small increases in kcat/KM for AC6C are due to two constraints. The first is the mechanistic requirement for catalyzing oxidative decarboxylation via a concerted decarboxylation/proton transfer transition state. The second is that DGD must catalyze transamination at the same active site in the second half-reaction of the ping-pong catalytic cycle."

"RICE, Robert",Cell-based assays for identification of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activators,"The Ah receptor (AhR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates a wide range of biological and toxicological effects from exposure to structurally diverse synthetic and naturally occurring chemicals. The role of the AhR and its signaling pathway in endogenous physiological functions and its involvement in immune cell development and human diseases has made it a target for development of therapeutic agents. The ability of the AhR to stimulate gene expression in a ligand-specific manner in recombinant mammalian cell lines containing a stably transfected AhR-responsive firefly luciferase or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene permits high throughput chemical screening for AhR activators. The induction of luciferase activity or EGFP fluorescence in these readily available recombinant cell lines occurs in a time-, dose- and AhR-dependent and chemical-specific manner where the magnitude of reporter gene induction is directly proportional to the concentration and potency of the inducing chemical. The AhR agonist activity of positive test chemicals can be confirmed by demonstrating their ability to stimulate expression of CYP1A1, an endogenous AhR-responsive gene, using quantitative real-time PCR. The detailed protocols described here provide step-by-step instructions for detection and characterization of activators of AhR-dependent gene expression that can readily be applied to other appropriate cell lines.

The average number and the average scalar pT sum of charged particles in the transverse region are sensitive to the modeling of the ""underlying event."" The transverse region is divided into a MAX and MIN transverse region, which helps separate the ""hard component"" (initial and final-state radiation) from the ""beam-beam remnant"" and multiple parton interaction components of the scattering. The center-of-mass energy dependence of the various components of the event is studied in detail.

Few interventions have focused on pregnant women reducing their SHS exposure.MethodsThis clustered randomized controlled trial, conducted at eight hospitals in Sichuan, China, compared a prenatal health education intervention with usual clinical care as a control. The primary outcome was self-reported ""no SHS exposure"" before and 3 months after birth. The intervention consisted of three large group educational sessions, standardized clinician advice, brief monthly follow-up calls, and educational materials and resources. A random sample of participants was biochemically validated before birth with hair nicotine, a long-term biomarker of smoke exposure.ResultsOverall, 1181 participants were randomized to intervention (n = 526) and control (n = 655) groups. More participants in the intervention group than the control group reported no SHS exposure 3 months after birth (Total: 77.9% vs. 52.6%, P < .001; Home: 81.2% vs. 53.3%, P < .001). The intervention group also had greater changes in improved smoke-free homes and SHS knowledge and attitudes. Controlling for covariates, the intervention group was less likely to report SHS exposure than the control group (Total: OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.31 to 0.71; Home: OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.21 to 0.53), and this effect was sustained 3 months after birth. The adjusted log concentration of hair nicotine for the intervention group decreased by 0.28 log Âµg/g more than the control group.ConclusionsOur smoke-free health education intervention for nonsmoking pregnant women significantly reduced SHS exposure before and after birth. This intervention model can become part of a standard protocol for the care of pregnant women in hospital settings."

Upper endoscopy for tissue immunofluorescent antibody assay and disaccharide gut permeability/absorption studies were performed before and after 8 weeks of SBI to test mucosal immunity and gastrointestinal function. Blood was collected for markers of microbial translocation, inflammation, and collagen kinetics. A validated gastrointestinal questionnaire assessed changes in symptoms.ResultsAll eight participants experienced profound improvement in symptoms with reduced bowel movements/day (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.008) and improvements in stool consistency (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.008). Gut permeability was normal before and after the intervention, but D-xylose absorption increased in seven of eight participants. Mucosal CD4 lymphocyte densities increased by a median of 139.5â€Šcells/mm2 from 213 to 322â€Šcells/mm2 (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.016). Intestinal-fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), a marker of enterocyte damage, initially rose in seven of eight participants after 8 weeks (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.039), and then fell below baseline in four of five who continued receiving SBI (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.12). Baseline serum I-FABP levels were negatively correlated with subsequent rise in mucosal CD4 lymphocyte densities (râ€Š=â€Š-0.74, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.046).ConclusionSBI significantly increases intestinal mucosal CD4 lymphocyte counts, improves duodenal function, and showed evidence of promoting intestinal repair in the setting of HIV enteropathy."

Materials and Methods We reviewed the medical records of 84 consecutively treated patients with stage T1-T2b non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with 88 courses of SBRT for 94 lung tumors from January 2007 to December 2014, including 17 patients with previous ALR. The rates of RP and all PT were compared between the patients with and without previous ALR. Results At a median follow-up duration of 18.3 months (range, 1.8-85.6 months), the crude grade 2+ RP rate was 5.9% and 2.8% for patients with and without previous ALR, respectively (P =.51). The corresponding 2-year estimates of freedom from RP were 89% and 97% (P =.51). The crude rate of all grade 2+ PT was 11.8% and 2.8% for those with and without previous ALR (P =.11), with 2-year estimates of freedom from PT of 97% and 84% (P =.11), respectively. The 2 cohorts were well matched by the mean lung dose, percentage of lung volume receiving 20 Gy (P =.86), and prescribed dose (P =.75). The 2-year estimates of local control, cause-specific survival, and overall survival were similar between the 2 cohorts. Conclusion The observed rates of PT were low among all patients, with a trend toward increased grade 2 and 3 lung toxicity among patients with previous ALR. Previous ALR did not increase the risk of grade 4 and 5 RP, and SBRT appears safe and effective in this population."

This study examined the latent longitudinal patterns of stages of change (SoC) for regular exercise over time among individuals participating in a lifestyle intervention project. It also investigated the association between the longitudinal patterns of SoC and intervention outcomes using a new statistical method to assess the relationship between latent class membership and distal outcomes. We analyzed data from the Special Diabetes Program for Indians Diabetes Prevention Program, a lifestyle intervention program to prevent diabetes among American Indians and Alaska Natives. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify the longitudinal patterns of SoC for regular exercise reported at three time points. LCA with distal outcomes was performed to investigate the associations between latent class membership and behavioral changes after the intervention. The parameters and standard errors of the LCA with distal outcomes models were estimated using an improved three-step approach. Three latent classes were identified: Pre-action, Transition, and Maintenance classes. The Transition class, where stage progression occurred, had the greatest improvements in physical activity and weight outcomes at both time points post-baseline among female participants. It also had the largest improvements in weight outcomes among male participants. Furthermore, the Pre-action class had more attenuation in the improvements they had achieved initially than the other two classes. These findings suggest the potential importance of motivating participants to modify their readiness for behavioral change in future lifestyle interventions."
"BALES, Karen L","Chronic oxytocin administration inhibits food intake, increases energy expenditure, and produces weight loss in fructose-fed obese rhesus monkeys","Despite compelling evidence that oxytocin (OT) is effective in reducing body weight (BW) in diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents, studies of the effects of OT in humans and rhesus monkeys have primarily focused on noningestive behaviors. The goal of this study was to translate findings in DIO rodents to a preclinical translational model of DIO. We tested the hypothesis that increased OT signaling would reduce BW in DIO rhesus monkeys by inhibiting food intake and increasing energy expenditure (EE). Male DIO rhesus monkeys from the California National Primate Research Center were adapted to a 12-h fast and maintained on chow and a daily 15% fructose-sweetened beverage. Monkeys received 2Ã— daily subcutaneous vehicle injections over 1 wk. We subsequently identified doses of OT (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) that reduced food intake and BW in the absence of nausea or diarrhea. Chronic administration of OT for 4 wk (0.2 mg/kg for 2 wk; 0.4 mg/kg for 2 wk) reduced BW relative to vehicle by 3.3 Â± 0.4% (â‰ˆ0.6 kg; P < 0.05). Moreover, the low dose of OT suppressed 12-h chow intake by 26 Â± 7% (P < 0.05). The higher dose of OT reduced 12-h chow intake by 27 Â± 5% (P < 0.05) and 8-h fructose-sweetened beverage intake by 18 Â± 8% (P < 0.05). OT increased EE during the dark cycle by 14 Â± 3% (P < 0.05) and was associated with elevations of free fatty acids and glycerol and reductions in triglycerides suggesting increased lipolysis. Together, these data suggest that OT reduces BW in DIO rhesus monkeys through decreased food intake as well as increased EE and lipolysis."
"RAMSEY, Jon J",Influence of dietary protein level on body composition and energy expenditure in calorically restricted overweight cats,"High-protein (HP) diets help prevent loss of lean mass in calorie-restricted (CR) cats. However, it is not entirely known whether these diets also induce changes of energy expenditure during periods of CR. To investigate this issue, sixteen overweight cats were fed either a high-protein [(HP), 54.2% of metabolizable energy (ME)] or a moderate-protein [(MP), 31.5% of ME] diet at 70% of their maintenance energy intakes for 8 weeks, and energy expenditure, energy intake, body weight and composition, and serum metabolites and hormones were measured. While both groups of cats lost weight at a similar rate, only cats eating the HP diet maintained lean mass during weight loss. Indirect respiration calorimetry measurements revealed that both total and resting energy expenditure (kcal/d) significantly decreased during weight loss for both treatment groups. However, only cats eating the MP diet exhibited significant decreases of total and resting energy expenditures after energy expenditure was normalized for body weight or lean mass. Results from this study suggest that in addition to sparing the loss of lean mass, feeding HP diets to overweight cats in restricted amounts may be beneficial for preventing or minimizing decreases of mass-adjusted energy expenditure during weight loss."
"HAVEL, Peter J",Early Effects of Neutering on Energy Expenditure in Adult Male Cats,"The initial cause of post-neutering weight gain in male cats is not entirely known. There is evidence that energy intake (EI) increases rapidly post-neutering, but it is not clear if neutering also decreases energy expenditure (EE) prior to weight gain. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if a decrease in EE contributes to the initial shift toward positive energy balance in neutered male cats. To determine the influence of neutering on EE independent of changes in EI and body weight (BW), male cats were fed at their pre-neutering maintenance EI and EE was measured at 4 days pre-neutering, 3-4 days post-neutering, and 9 days post- neutering. Ad libitum food access was then provided for 6 months. Body composition was measured and blood samples collected for serum chemistry at pre-neutering and 7 days, 13 days and 6 months post-neutering. Total energy expenditure (TEE) adjusted for lean body mass (LBM) did not change in cats from pre-neutering to 9 days post-neutering. However, TEE adjusted for BW and resting energy expenditure adjusted for either LBM or BW showed a small, but significant (P<0.05) increase from pre-neutering to 9 days post-neutering. When allowed free choice food access, cats showed significant increases of food intake (FI) and BW. Circulating concentrations of ghrelin increased, while adiponectin levels decreased following neutering. The results of this study indicate that initial post-neutering weight gain in male cats results from increased FI and not decreased EE. Long-term control of FI should be initiated after neutering to prevent hyperphagia and weight gain in male cats."
"BOONE, John M","Non-rigid registration of serial dedicated breast CT, longitudinal dedicated breast CT and PET/CT images using the diffeomorphic demons method","Rationale and objectivesDedicated breast CT and PET/CT scanners provide detailed 3D anatomical and functional imaging data sets and are currently being investigated for applications in breast cancer management such as diagnosis, monitoring response to therapy and radiation therapy planning. Our objective was to evaluate the performance of the diffeomorphic demons (DD) non-rigid image registration method to spatially align 3D serial (pre- and post-contrast) dedicated breast computed tomography (CT), and longitudinally-acquired dedicated 3D breast CT and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT images.MethodsThe algorithmic parameters of the DD method were optimized for the alignment of dedicated breast CT images using training data and fixed. The performance of the method for image alignment was quantitatively evaluated using three separate data sets; (1) serial breast CT pre- and post-contrast images of 20 women, (2) breast CT images of 20 women acquired before and after repositioning the subject on the scanner, and (3) dedicated breast PET/CT images of 7 women undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy acquired pre-treatment and after 1 cycle of therapy.ResultsThe DD registration method outperformed no registration (p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001) and conventional affine registration (p&nbsp;â‰¤&nbsp;0.002) for serial and longitudinal breast CT and PET/CT image alignment. In spite of the large size of the imaging data, the computational cost of the DD method was found to be reasonable (3-5&nbsp;min).ConclusionsCo-registration of dedicated breast CT and PET/CT images can be performed rapidly and reliably using the DD method. This is the first study evaluating the DD registration method for the alignment of dedicated breast CT and PET/CT images."

Because the core feature of FXTAS is motor impairment, determining the influence of FMR1 mRNA levels on structural connectivity of motor fiber tracts is critical for a better understanding of the pathologic features of FXTAS.ObjectiveTo examine the associations of CGG repeat and FMR1 mRNA with motor-related fiber tracts in males with premutation alleles.Design and settingA case-control study conducted at the University of California, Davis, from April 1, 2008, through August 31, 2009. All data were collected masked to the carrier status of the FMR1 gene.ParticipantsThirty-six male premutation carriers with FXTAS and 26 male premutation carriers without FXTAS were recruited through their family relationships with children affected by fragile X syndrome. The controls were 34 unaffected family members and healthy volunteers from the local community.Main outcomes and measuresThe CGG repeat lengths and FMR1 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes, motor functioning, and white matter structural integrity that were estimated using diffusion tensor imaging. After data collection, we selected 4 motor tracts to reconstruct using diffusion tensor tractography, namely, the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, descending motor tracts (containing the corticospinal, corticobulbar, and corticopontine tracts), and the anterior body of the corpus callosum.ResultsAll fiber tracts exhibited weaker structural connectivity in the FXTAS group (decreased 5%-53% from controls, P â‰¤ .02). Genetic imaging correlation analysis revealed negative associations of CGG repeat length and FMR1 mRNA with connectivity strength of the superior cerebellar peduncles in both premutation groups (partial rÂ² = 0.23-0.33, P â‰¤ .004). In addition, the measurements from the corpus callosum and superior cerebellar peduncles revealed a high correlation with motor functioning in all 3 groups (r between partial least square predicted and actual test scores = 0.41-0.56, P â‰¤ .04).Conclusions and relevanceDistinct pathophysiologic processes may underlie the structural impairment of the motor tracts in FXTAS. Although both the corpus callosum and superior cerebellar peduncles were of great importance to motor functioning, only the superior cerebellar peduncles exhibited an association with the elevated RNA levels in the blood of fragile X premutation carriers."
"CHEN, Xi",Host adaptation of a bacterial toxin from the human pathogen Salmonella Typhi.,"Salmonella Typhi is an exclusive human pathogen that causes typhoid fever. Typhoid toxin is a S. Typhi virulence factor that can reproduce most of the typhoid fever symptoms in experimental animals. Toxicity depends on toxin binding to terminally sialylated glycans on surface glycoproteins. Human glycans are unusual because of the lack of CMAH, which in other mammals converts N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) to N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Here, we report that typhoid toxin binds to and is toxic toward cells expressing glycans terminated in Neu5Ac (expressed by humans) over glycans terminated in Neu5Gc (expressed by other mammals). Mice constitutively expressing CMAH thus displaying Neu5Gc in all tissues are resistant to typhoid toxin. The atomic structure of typhoid toxin bound to Neu5Ac reveals the structural bases for its binding specificity. These findings provide insight into the molecular bases for Salmonella Typhi's host specificity and may help the development of therapies for typhoid fever."
"CHEN, Hongwu","Kinesin Family Deregulation Coordinated by Bromodomain Protein ANCCA and Histone Methyltransferase MLL for Breast Cancer Cell Growth, Survival, and Tamoxifen Resistance","UnlabelledKinesins are a superfamily of motor proteins and often deregulated in different cancers. However, the mechanism of their deregulation has been poorly understood. Through examining kinesin gene family expression in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells, we found that estrogen stimulation of cancer cell proliferation involves a concerted regulation of specific kinesins. Estrogen strongly induces expression of 19 kinesin genes such as Kif4A/4B, Kif5A/5B, Kif10, Kif11, Kif15, Kif18A/18B, Kif20A/20B, Kif21, Kif23, Kif24, Kif25, and KifC1, whereas suppresses the expression of seven others, including Kif1A, Kif1C, Kif7, and KifC3. Interestingly, the bromodomain protein ANCCA/ATAD2, previously shown to be an estrogen-induced chromatin regulator, plays a crucial role in the up- and downregulation of kinesins by estrogen. Its overexpression drives estrogen-independent upregulation of specific kinesins. Mechanistically, ANCCA (AAA nuclear coregulator cancer associated) mediates E2-dependent recruitment of E2F and MLL1 histone methyltransferase at kinesin gene promoters for gene activation-associated H3K4me3 methylation. Importantly, elevated levels of Kif4A, Kif15, Kif20A, and Kif23 correlate with that of ANCCA in the tumors and with poor relapse-free survival of patients with ER-positive breast cancer. Their knockdown strongly impeded proliferation and induced apoptosis of both tamoxifen-sensitive and resistant cancer cells. Together, the study reveals ANCCA as a key mediator of kinesin family deregulation in breast cancer and the crucial role of multiple kinesins in growth and survival of the tumor cells.ImplicationsThese findings support the development of novel inhibitors of cancer-associated kinesins and their regulator ANCCA for effective treatment of cancers including tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers."

The NIH Toolbox is an initiative of the Neuroscience Blueprint, a collaborative framework through which 16 NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices jointly support neuroscience-related research, to accelerate discoveries and reduce the burden of nervous system disorders. The CB is one of four modules that measure cognitive, emotional, sensory, and motor health across the lifespan. The CB is unique in its continuity across childhood, adolescence, early adulthood, and old age, and in order to help create a common currency among disparate studies, it is also available at low cost to researchers for use in large-scale longitudinal and epidemiologic studies. This chapter describes the evolution of the CB; methods for selecting cognitive subdomains and instruments; the rationale for test design; and a validation study in children and adolescents, ages 3-15 years. Subsequent chapters feature detailed discussions of each test measure and its psychometric properties (Chapters 2-6), the factor structure of the test battery (Chapter 7), the effects of age and education on composite test scores (Chapter 8), and a final summary and discussion (Chapter 9). As the chapters in this monograph demonstrate, the CB has excellent psychometric properties, and the validation study provided evidence for the increasing differentiation of cognitive abilities with age."

Reactive cutaneous eruptions resulting from the pulmonary infection are difficult to diagnose because skin biopsies do not contain the organism. We present an adolescent male with primary pulmonary C.immitis infection manifesting with biopsy proven subcorneal pustular dermatosis. Serological studies revealed increasingly positive titers for coccidioidomycosis and symptoms resolved promptly following initiation of systemic antifungal therapy. Our unique case presentation illustrates subcorneal pustular dermatosis as a reactive eruption owing to primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. An association between the two conditions warrants further investigation.
"TONG, Elisa K",Increases in Light and Intermittent Smoking Among Asian Americans and Non-Hispanic Whites,"IntroductionAsian Americans are the fastest growing immigrant group in the United States and are more likely to be light and intermittent smokers (LITS) compared with non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). LITS experience adverse health effects related to smoking. Previous research has aggregated Asian American ethnic groups, masking important differences between groups. We sought to compare LITS rates among Asian American subgroups before and after the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) with NHWs in California utilizing data from the California Tobacco Surveys (CTS).MethodsWe combined 1990, 1992, and 1996 CTS (pre-MSA) and the 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008 CTS (post-MSA) to examine changes in LITS (<10 cigarettes/day or not smoking daily). Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, and Korean ethnic groups were compared with NHWs.ResultsPre-MSA logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, education level, language spoken at home, and use of other tobacco products found that Chinese (odds ratio [OR] = 3.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.19, 5.21), Filipinos (OR = 3.55, 95% CI = 2.73, 4.63), Japanese (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.22, 3.27), and Koreans (OR = 3.22, 95% CI = 2.06, 5.03) were significantly more likely to be LITS compared with NHWs. Post-MSA, all Asian American subgroups experienced an increase in LITS (11.7%-37.8%); however, only Chinese (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.16, 4.13) and Filipinos (OR = 3.33, 95% CI = 2.26, 4.91) remained significantly more likely to be LITS compared with NHWs.ConclusionsOur results highlight the need for tobacco control efforts that address the growing group of LITS among Asian Americans and NHWs."

Co-located, continuous snow depth and soil moisture measurements were deployed in a rain-snow transition catchment in the mixed-conifer forest in the Southern Sierra Nevada. At each elevation sensors were placed in the open, under the canopy, and at the drip edge on both north- and south-facing slopes. Snow sensors were placed at 27 locations, with soil moisture and temperature sensors placed at depths of 10, 30, 60, and 90 cm beneath the snow sensor. Soils are weakly developed (Inceptisols and Entisols) and formed from decomposed granite with properties that change with elevation. The soil- bedrock interface is hard in upper reaches of the basin (>2000 m) where glaciers have scoured the parent material approximately 18,000 yr ago. Below an elevation of 2000 m soils have a paralithic contact (weathered saprolite) that can extend beyond a depth of 1.5 m, facilitating pathways for deep percolation. Soils are wet and not frozen in winter, and dry out in the weeks following spring snowmelt and rain. Based on data from two snowmelt seasons, it was found that soils dry out following snowmelt at relatively uniform rates; however, the timing of drying at a given site may be offset by up to 4 wk because of heterogeneity in snowmelt at different elevations and aspects. Spring and summer rainfall mainly affected sites in the open, with drying after a rain event being faster than following snowmelt. Water loss rates from soil of 0.5 to 1.0 cm d -1 during the winter and snowmelt season reflect a combination of evapotranspiration and deep drainage, as stream baseflow remains relatively low. About one-third of annual evapotranspiration comes from water storage below the 1-m depth, that is, below mapped soil. We speculate that much of the deep drainage is stored locally in the deeper regolith during periods of high precipitation, being available for tree transpiration during summer and fall months when shallow soil water storage is limiting. Total annual evapotranspiration for water year 2009 was estimated to be approximately 76 cm. Â© Soil Science Society of America."

We determined viral RNA (vRNA) levels and the envelope gene sequence in the SIVmac 251 viral populations in the genital tract and semen of 5 adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that were infected after experimental penile SIV infection. Paired blood and semen samples were collected from 1-9 weeks after infection and the monkeys were necropsied eleven weeks after infection. The axillary lymph nodes, testes, epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicles were collected and vRNA levels and single-genome analysis of the SIVmac251 env variants was performed. At the time of semen collection, blood vRNA levels were between 3.09 and 7.85 log10 vRNA copies/ml plasma. SIV RNA was found in the axillary lymph nodes of all five monkeys and in 3 of 5 monkeys, all tissues examined were vRNA positive. In these 3 monkeys, vRNA levels (log10 SIVgag copies/ug of total tissue RNA) in the axillary lymph node (6.48 Â± 0.50) were significantly higher than in the genital tract tissues: testis (3.67 Â± 2.16; p<0.05), epididymis (3.08 Â± 1.19; p<0.0001), prostate (3.36 Â± 1.30; p<0.01), and seminal vesicle (2.67 Â± 1.50; p<0.0001). Comparison of the SIVmac251 env viral populations in blood plasma, systemic lymph node, and genital tract tissues was performed in two of the macaques. Visual inspection of the Neighbor-Joining phylograms revealed that in both animals, all the sequences were generally distributed evenly among all tissue compartments. Importantly, viral populations in the genital tissues were not distinct from those in the systemic tissues. Our findings demonstrate striking similarity in the viral populations in the blood and male genital tract tissues within 3 months of penile SIV transmission."

"THORNE, James H",Multiscale Patterns of Riparian Plant Diversity and Implications for Restoration,"Planning riparian restoration to resemble historic reference conditions requires an understanding of both local and regional patterns of plant species diversity. Thus, understanding species distributions at multiple spatial scales is essential to improve restoration planting success, to enhance long-term ecosystem functioning, and to match restoration planting designs with historic biogeographic distributions. To inform restoration planning, we examined the biogeographic patterns of riparian plant diversity at local and regional scales within a major western U.S.A. drainage, California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley. We analyzed patterns of species richness and complementarity (Î²-diversity) across two scales: the watershed scale and the floodplain scale. At the watershed scale, spatial patterns of native riparian richness were driven by herbaceous species, whereas woody species were largely cosmopolitan across the nearly 38,000 km 2 study area. At the floodplain scale, riparian floras reflected species richness and dissimilarity patterns related to hydrological and disturbance-driven successional sequences. These findings reinforce the importance of concurrently evaluating both local and regional processes that promote species diversity and distribution of native riparian flora. Furthermore, as restoration activities become more prevalent across the landscape, strategies for restoration outcomes should emulate the patterns of species diversity and biogeographic distributions found at regional scales.

There is significant overlap between Inc targets and viral proteins, suggesting common pathogenic mechanisms among obligate intracellular microbes. IncE binds to sorting nexins (SNXs) 5/6, components of the retromer, which relocalizes SNX5/6 to the inclusion membrane and augments inclusion membrane tubulation. Depletion of retromer components enhances progeny production, revealing that retromer restricts Chlamydia infection. This study demonstrates the value of proteomics in unveiling hostpathogen interactions in genetically challenging microbes."
"LIU, Kai",Realization of ground-state artificial skyrmion lattices at room temperature,"The topological nature of magnetic skyrmions leads to extraordinary properties that provide new insights into fundamental problems of magnetism and exciting potentials for novel magnetic technologies. Prerequisite are systems exhibiting skyrmion lattices at ambient conditions, which have been elusive so far. Here, we demonstrate the realization of artificial Bloch skyrmion lattices over extended areas in their ground state at room temperature by patterning asymmetric magnetic nanodots with controlled circularity on an underlayer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Polarity is controlled by a tailored magnetic field sequence and demonstrated in magnetometry measurements. The vortex structure is imprinted from the dots into the interfacial region of the underlayer via suppression of the PMA by a critical ion-irradiation step. The imprinted skyrmion lattices are identified directly with polarized neutron reflectometry and confirmed by magnetoresistance measurements. Our results demonstrate an exciting platform to explore room-temperature ground-state skyrmion lattices."

"HERTZ-PICCIOTTO, Irva",Paternal sperm DNA methylation associated with early signs of autism risk in an autism-enriched cohort,"BackgroundEpigenetic mechanisms such as altered DNA methylation have been suggested to play a role in autism, beginning with the classical association of Prader-Willi syndrome, an imprinting disorder, with autistic features.ObjectivesHere we tested for the relationship of paternal sperm DNA methylation with autism risk in offspring, examining an enriched-risk cohort of fathers of autistic children.MethodsWe examined genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) in paternal semen biosamples obtained from an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) enriched-risk pregnancy cohort, the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) cohort, to estimate associations between sperm DNAm and prospective ASD development, using a 12-month ASD symptoms assessment, the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI). We analysed methylation data from 44 sperm samples run on the CHARM 3.0 array, which contains over 4 million probes (over 7 million CpG sites), including 30 samples also run on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip platform (âˆ¼485&nbsp;000 CpG sites). We also examined associated regions in an independent sample of post-mortem human brain ASD and control samples for which Illumina 450K DNA methylation data were available.ResultsUsing region-based statistical approaches, we identified 193 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in paternal sperm with a family-wise empirical P-value [family-wise error rate (FWER)] <0.05 associated with performance on the Autism Observational Scale for Infants (AOSI) at 12 months of age in offspring. The DMRs clustered near genes involved in developmental processes, including many genes in the SNORD family, within the Prader-Willi syndrome gene cluster. These results were consistent among the 75 probes on the Illumina 450K array that cover AOSI-associated DMRs from CHARM. Further, 18 of 75 (24%) 450K array probes showed consistent differences in the cerebellums of autistic individuals compared with controls.ConclusionsThese data suggest that epigenetic differences in paternal sperm may contribute to autism risk in offspring, and provide evidence that directionally consistent, potentially related epigenetic mechanisms may be operating in the cerebellum of individuals with autism."
"LANE, Nancy E",Do persons with asymmetric hip pain or radiographic hip OA have worse pain and structure outcomes in the knee opposite the more affected hip? Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative,"PurposeTo determine if asymmetry between hips in pain or radiographic osteoarthritis (RHOA) is associated with worse pain and joint space narrowing (JSN) at baseline and longitudinally in knees contralateral to more affected hips.MethodsWe studied 279 participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative with baseline asymmetry between hips in pain and 483 with asymmetry in RHOA none of whom had a hip replacement for â‰¥4 years after baseline. RHOA assessed from pelvis radiographs was categorized as none, possible or definite and hip pain on most days of a month in the past year as present/absent. Knee pain (WOMAC scale) and JSN (fixed flexion radiographs) were categorized as none, mild and moderate-severe. We compared knees contralateral and ipsilateral to more affected hips on baseline knee pain and JSN using clustered multinomial regression and on change in knee pain and JSN over 4-5 years using generalized linear and logistic estimating equations.ResultsKnees contralateral to painful hips had less baseline pain (""moderate-severe"" vs ""none"", relative risk ratio [RRR]: 0.39, 95% CI = 0.27-0.57), but greater baseline JSN (""moderate-severe"" vs ""none"", RRR: 1.62, 95% CI = 1.09-2.38) and greater worsening of pain during follow-up (P = 0.001). Knees contralateral to hips with worse RHOA had nonsignificant trends for greater baseline JSN (P = 0.10) and JSN progression (P = 0.17).ConclusionThese findings provide limited support for the hypothesis that early asymmetry in hip pain and RHOA is associated with worse pain and structural outcomes in knees contralateral to the more affected hip."

All acute MCA stroke patients underwent a MRI scan before intravenous thrombolytic therapy was included. DWI lesions were divided into 6 patterns (territorial, other cortical, small superficial, internal border zone, small deep, and other deep infarcts). Lesion volumes were measured by dedicated imaging processing software. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 0-2 at 90 days.ResultsAmong the 172 patients included in our study, 75 (43.6%) were observed to have territorial infarct patterns or other deep infarct patterns. These patients also had higher baseline NIHSS score (p < 0.001), a higher proportion of large cerebral artery occlusions (p < 0.001) and larger infarct volume (p < 0.001). Favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) was achieved in 89 patients (51.7%). After multivariable analysis, groups with specific lesion patterns, including territorial infarct and other deep infarct pattern, were independently associated with favorable outcome (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.16-0.99; p = 0.047).ConclusionsSpecific lesion patterns predict differential outcome after intravenous thrombolysis therapy in acute MCA stroke patients."

The fisher (Pekania pennanti), a North American mid-sized carnivore whose range in the western Pacific United States has retracted considerably in the past century, was proposed for threatened status protection in late 2014 under the United States Endangered Species Act by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in its West Coast Distinct Population Segment. We investigated mortality in 167 fishers from two genetically and geographically distinct sub-populations in California within this West Coast Distinct Population Segment using a combination of gross necropsy, histology, toxicology and molecular methods. Overall, predation (70%), natural disease (16%), toxicant poisoning (10%) and, less commonly, vehicular strike (2%) and other anthropogenic causes (2%) were causes of mortality observed. We documented both an increase in mortality to (57% increase) and exposure (6%) from pesticides in fishers in just the past three years, highlighting further that toxicants from marijuana cultivation still pose a threat. Additionally, exposure to multiple rodenticides significantly increased the likelihood of mortality from rodenticide poisoning. Poisoning was significantly more common in male than female fishers and was 7 times more likely than disease to kill males. Based on necropsy findings, suspected causes of mortality based on field evidence alone tended to underestimate the frequency of disease-related mortalities. This study is the first comprehensive investigation of mortality causes of fishers and provides essential information to assist in the conservation of this species."

We show that this system, which we call the Doublets net, constitutes a complex body of linguistic knowledge concerning English word structure that has computable multiscale features. Distributed morphological, phonological and orthographic constraints and the language's local redundancy are seen at the node level. Phonological communities are seen at the network level. And a balancing act between the language's global efficiency and redundancy is seen at the system level. We develop a new measure of intrinsic node-to-node distance and a computational algorithm, called community geometry, which reveal the implicit multiscale structure within binary networks. Because the Doublets net is a modular complex cognitive system, the community geometry and computable multi-scale structural information may provide a foundation for understanding computational learning in many systems whose network structure has yet to be fully analyzed."

"VISHIK, Inna M",Energy gaps in high-transition-temperature cuprate superconductors,"The spectral energy gap is an important signature that defines states of quantum matter: insulators, density waves and superconductors have very different gap structures. The momentum-resolved nature of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) makes it a powerful tool to characterize spectral gaps. ARPES has been instrumental in establishing the anisotropic d-wave structure of the superconducting gap in high-transitionerature (T c ) cuprates, which is different from the conventional isotropic s-wave superconducting gap. Shortly afterwards, ARPES demonstrated that an anomalous gap above T c , often termed the pseudogap, follows a similar anisotropy. The nature of this poorly understood pseudogap and its relationship with superconductivity has since become the focal point of research in the field. To address this issue, the momentum, temperature, doping and materials dependence of spectral gaps have been extensively examined with significantly improved instrumentation and carefully matched experiments in recent years. This article overviews the current understanding and unresolved issues of the basic phenomenology of gap hierarchy. We show how ARPES has been sensitive to phase transitions, has distinguished between orders having distinct broken electronic symmetries, and has uncovered rich momentum- and temperature-dependent fingerprints reflecting an intertwined and competing relationship between the ordered states and superconductivity that results in multiple phenomenologically distinct ground states inside the superconducting dome. These results provide us with microscopic insights into the cuprate phase diagram. Â© 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved."

"SPRIET, Mathieu",Feasibility Study of Canine Epidermal Neural Crest Stem Cell Transplantation in the Spinal Cords of Dogs.,"UnlabelledThis pilot feasibility study aimed to determine the outcome of canine epidermal neural crest stem cell (cEPI-NCSC) grafts in the normal spinal cords of healthy bred-for-research dogs. This included developing novel protocols for (a) the ex vivo expansion of cEPI-NCSCs, (b) the delivery of cEPI-NCSCs into the spinal cord, and (c) the labeling of the cells and subsequent tracing of the graft in the live animal by magnetic resonance imaging. A total of four million cEPI-NCSCs were injected into the spinal cord divided in two locations. Differences in locomotion at baseline and post-treatment were evaluated by gait analysis and compared with neurological outcome and behavioral exams. Histopathological analyses of the spinal cords and cEPI-NCSC grafts were performed at 3 weeks post-transplantation. Neurological and gait parameters were minimally affected by the stem cell injection. cEPI-NCSCs survived in the canine spinal cord for the entire period of investigation and did not migrate or proliferate. Subsets of cEPI-NCSCs expressed the neural crest stem cell marker Sox10. There was no detectable expression of markers for glial cells or neurons. The tissue reaction to the cell graft was predominantly vascular in addition to a degree of reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation. In the present study, we demonstrated that cEPI-NCSC grafts survive in the spinal cords of healthy dogs without major adverse effects. They persist locally in the normal spinal cord, may promote angiogenesis and tissue remodeling, and elicit a tissue response that may be beneficial in patients with spinal cord injury.SignificanceIt has been established that mouse and human epidermal neural crest stem cells are somatic multipotent stem cells with proved innovative potential in a mouse model of spinal cord injury (SCI) offering promise of a valid treatment for SCI. Traumatic SCI is a common neurological problem in dogs with marked similarities, clinically and pathologically, to the syndrome in people. For this reason, dogs provide a readily accessible, clinically realistic, spontaneous model for evaluation of epidermal neural crest stem cells therapeutic intervention. The results of this study are expected to give the baseline data for a future clinical trial in dogs with traumatic SCI."
"HIJMANS, Robert J","Multiple lines of evidence for the origin of domesticated chili pepper, Capsicum annuum, in Mexico","The study of crop origins has traditionally involved identifying geographic areas of high morphological diversity, sampling populations of wild progenitor species, and the archaeological retrieval of macroremains. Recent investigations have added identification of plant microremains (phytoliths, pollen, and starch grains), biochemical and molecular genetic approaches, and dating through (14)C accelerator mass spectrometry. We investigate the origin of domesticated chili pepper, Capsicum annuum, by combining two approaches, species distribution modeling and paleobiolinguistics, with microsatellite genetic data and archaeobotanical data. The combination of these four lines of evidence yields consensus models indicating that domestication of C. annuum could have occurred in one or both of two areas of Mexico: northeastern Mexico and central-east Mexico. Genetic evidence shows more support for the more northern location, but jointly all four lines of evidence support central-east Mexico, where preceramic macroremains of chili pepper have been recovered in the Valley of TehuacÃ¡n. Located just to the east of this valley is the center of phylogenetic diversity of Proto-Otomanguean, a language spoken in mid-Holocene times and the oldest protolanguage for which a word for chili pepper reconstructs based on historical linguistics. For many crops, especially those that do not have a strong archaeobotanical record or phylogeographic pattern, it is difficult to precisely identify the time and place of their origin. Our results for chili pepper show that expressing all data in similar distance terms allows for combining contrasting lines of evidence and locating the region(s) where cultivation and domestication of a crop began."

"RICE, Robert",Assessing probe-specific dye and slide biases in two-color microarray data.,"A primary reason for using two-color microarrays is that the use of two samples labeled with different dyes on the same slide, that bind to probes on the same spot, is supposed to adjust for many factors that introduce noise and errors into the analysis. Most users assume that any differences between the dyes can be adjusted out by standard methods of normalization, so that measures such as log ratios on the same slide are reliable measures of comparative expression. However, even after the normalization, there are still probe specific dye and slide variation among the data. We define a method to quantify the amount of the dye-by-probe and slide-by-probe interaction. This serves as a diagnostic, both visual and numeric, of the existence of probe-specific dye bias. We show how this improved the performance of two-color array analysis for arrays for genomic analysis of biological samples ranging from rice to human tissue.We develop a procedure for quantifying the extent of probe-specific dye and slide bias in two-color microarrays. The primary output is a graphical diagnostic of the extent of the bias which called ECDF (Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function), though numerical results are also obtained.We show that the dye and slide biases were high for human and rice genomic arrays in two gene expression facilities, even after the standard intensity-based normalization, and describe how this diagnostic allowed the problems causing the probe-specific bias to be addressed, and resulted in important improvements in performance.

We experimentally measured the velocities of bubbles and rigid spheres in mud sampled from the Davis-Schrimpf mud volcanoes adjacent to the Salton Sea, Southern California. Combined with previous measurements in the polymer gel Carbopol, we obtained an empirical model for the drag coefficient and bounded the conditions under which bubbles overcome the yield stress. Yield stresses typical of mud and basaltic magmas with sub-mm particles can immobilize millimeter to centimeter sized bubbles. At Stromboli volcano, Italy, a vertical yield stress gradient in the shallow conduit may immobilize bubbles with diameter â‰². 1. cm and hinder slug coalescence."

"PERI, Giovanni",Regional non-adjustment and fiscal policy,"How will countries handle idiosyncratic macroeconomic shocks under the single currency? Since the regional adjustment patterns currently prevailing within European currency unions are likely to prevail at the national level under the single currency, looking at the ways in which European countries react to internally asymmetric shocks today provides a good preview for the answer to that question. In this paper, we compare the USA with Germany, Italy and the UK, and with Canada, which is closer to Europe than the USA in its labour market and fiscal institutions. Europe's (and to some extent Canada's) model of regional response differs from that of the USA. Changes in regional real exchange rates are small in all countries. Outside of the USA, however, there is more reliance on interregional transfer payments, less on labour migration, and the pace of regional adjustment appears to be slower. If EMU aims at the same degree of economic and social cohesion that its constituent nations enjoy today, this suggests that its members may find it hard to resist the eventual extension of existing EU mechanisms of income redistribution - a transfer union. We propose an alternative strategy based on a relaxed Stability Pact, further strictures against central EU borrowing, labour market and fiscal reform, and the issuance by individual member states of debt indexed to nominal GDP."

Linear mixed-models were fitted for continuous outcome variables and GEE models with logit link function for binary outcome variables. At baseline, over 52% of participants had Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test times of 12 s or more, which indicates below-normal performance. On average, participants showed significant reductions in TUG test scores at the postintervention (11% reduction, p < .001). Participants also showed significant improvements in general health status (p = .002), unhealthy physical days (p = .032), combined unhealthy physical and mental days (p = .006), and days limited from usual activity (p = .045). Findings suggest that performance indicators can be objectively collected and integrated into evaluation designs of community-based, activity-rich lifestyle programs."

"ANASTASIO, Cort",Rates of Hydroxyl Radical Production from Transition Metals and Quinones in a Surrogate Lung Fluid,"Hydroxyl radical ((â€¢)OH) is the most reactive, and perhaps most detrimental to health, of the reactive oxygen species. (â€¢)OH production in lungs following inhalation of particulate matter (PM) can result from redox-active chemicals, including iron and copper, but the relative importance of these species is unknown. This work investigates (â€¢)OH production from iron, copper, and quinones, both individually and in mixtures at atmospherically relevant concentrations. Iron, copper, and three of the four quinones (1,2-naphthoquinone, phenanthrenequinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone) produce (â€¢)OH. Mixtures of copper or quinones with iron synergistically produce (â€¢)OH at a rate 20-130% higher than the sum of the rates of the individual redox-active species. We developed a regression equation from 20 mixtures to predict the rate of (â€¢)OH production from the particle composition. For typical PM compositions, iron and copper account for most (â€¢)OH production, whereas quinones are a minor source, although they can contribute if present at very high concentrations. This work shows that Cu contributes significantly to (â€¢)OH production in ambient PM; other work has shown that Cu appears to be the primary driver of HOOH production and dithiothreitol (DTT) loss in ambient PM extracts. Taken together, these results indicate that copper appears to be the most important individual contributor to direct oxidant production from inhaled PM."

"CHUAH, Chen-Nee",Adaptive Traffic Signal Control with Vehicular Ad hoc Networks,"In this paper, we propose to use vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) to collect and aggregate real-time speed and position information on individual vehicles to optimize signal control at traffic intersections. We first formulate the vehicular traffic signal control problem as a job scheduling problem on processors, with jobs corresponding to platoons of vehicles. Under the assumption that all jobs are of equal size, we give an online algorithm, referred to as the oldest job first (OJF) algorithm, to minimize the delay across the intersection. We prove that the OJF algorithm is 2-competitive, implying that the delay is less than or equal to twice the delay of an optimal offline schedule with perfect knowledge of the arrivals. We then show how a VANET can be used to group vehicles into approximately equal-sized platoons, which can then be scheduled using OJF. We call this the two-phase approach, where we first group the vehicular traffic into platoons and then apply the OJF algorithm, i.e., the oldest arrival first (OAF) algorithm. Our simulation results show that, under light and medium traffic loads, the OAF algorithm reduces the delays experienced by vehicles as they pass through the intersection, as compared with vehicle-actuated methods, Webster's method, and pretimed signal control methods. Under heavy vehicular traffic load, the OAF algorithm performs the same as the vehicle-actuated traffic method but still produces lower delays, as when compared with Webster's method and the pretimed signal control method.

"RECANZONE, Gregg H",Regional and ageâ€related differences in GAD67 expression of parvalbuminâ€ and calbindinâ€expressing neurons in the rhesus macaque auditory midbrain and brainstem,"Neurons expressing the calcium binding proteins (CaBPs) parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin (CB) have shown age-related density changes throughout the ascending auditory system of both rodents and macaque monkeys. In the cerebral cortex, neurons expressing these CaBPs express markers of Î³-aminobutyric acidergic neurotransmission, such as GAD67, and have well-understood physiological response properties. Recent evidence suggests that, in the rodent auditory brainstem, CaBP-containing cells do not express GAD67. It is unknown whether PV- and CB-containing cells in subcortical auditory structures of macaques similarly do not express GAD67, and a better understanding of the neurotransmission of neurons expressing these proteins is necessary for understanding the age-related changes in their density throughout the macaque auditory system. This was investigated with immunofluorescent double-labeling techniques to coregister PV- and CB-expressing neurons with GAD67 in the superior olivary complex and the inferior colliculus of young and aged rhesus macaques. The proportions of GAD67-expressing PV- and CB-positive neurons were computed with unbiased sampling techniques. Our results indicate that between 42% and 62% of PV- and CB-positive neurons in the auditory brainstem and midbrain express GAD67, which is significantly less than in the cerebrum. In general, fewer PV(+) neurons and more CB(+) neurons expressed GAD67 as a function of age. These results demonstrate that the inhibitory molecular profile of PV- and CB-expressing neurons can change with age in subcortical auditory structures and that these neurons are distinct from the well-described inhibitory interneurons that express these proteins in the cerebral cortex."
"LIU, Hong",Nuclear factor-ÎºB inhibition provides additional protection against ischaemia/reperfusion injury in delayed sevoflurane preconditioning,"Background and objectiveSevoflurane anaesthetic preconditioning (SPC) has been shown to limit nuclear factor-[kappa]B (NF-[kappa]B) activation and the production of inflammatory cytokines during myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R). Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of NF-[kappa]B using parthenolide is effective in limiting I/R injury. We, therefore, postulated that the protective effect of delayed SPC would be enhanced by pharmacological NF-[kappa]B inhibition during I/R.MethodsHearts from 2-month-old male Fisher 344 rats were exposed to 25 min global ischaemia followed by 60 min reperfusion. Rats were divided into four groups prior to I/R: control group; parthenolide group, treated with the I[kappa]B kinase inhibitor parthenolide intraperitoneally 10 min prior to heart isolation; SPC group, treated for 60 min with sevoflurane 48 h prior to heart isolation; and SPC + parthenolide group, treated with SPC for 1 h followed by parthenolide 48 h later. Infarct area, left ventricular function and Ca2+(i) were measured after I/R.ResultsDelayed SPC + parthenolide resulted in greater protection than either intervention alone, resulting in a significant reduction in infarct area and left ventricular developed pressure (mmHg; 84 +/- 19 compared with 15 +/- 14 in control hearts; P = 0.007). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure also remained close to baseline values (9 +/- 2 mmHg, P = 0.02) during I/R, and the increase in Ca2+(i) seen with I/R was significantly blunted (P = 0.005).ConclusionSPC followed by parthenolide provides a significant protection from I/R injury in this model. As each intervention alone limits NF-[kappa]B activation with I/R, these data are consistent with additive effects of these dual modalities in limiting I/R injury due to NF-[kappa]B activation."

The RecQ helicase is involved in repairing damage caused by DNA breaks and stalled replication forks via homologous recombination. Here, the helicase activity of RecQ was visualized on single molecules of DNA using a fluorescent sensor that directly detects ssDNA. By monitoring the formation and progression of individual unwinding forks, we observed that both the frequency of initiation and the rate of unwinding are highly dependent on RecQ concentration. We establish that unwinding forks can initiate internally by melting dsDNA and can proceed in both directions at up to 40-60 bp/s. The findings suggest that initiation requires a RecQ dimer, and that continued processive unwinding of several kilobases involves multiple monomers at the DNA unwinding fork. We propose a distinctive model wherein RecQ melts dsDNA internally to initiate unwinding and subsequently assembles at the fork into a distribution of multimeric species, each encompassing a broad distribution of rates, to unwind DNA. These studies define the species that promote resection of DNA, proofreading of homologous pairing, and migration of Holliday junctions, and they suggest that various functional forms of RecQ can be assembled that unwind at rates tailored to the diverse biological functions of RecQ helicase."
"HANDY, Susan L","Methodological Issues in the Estimation of the Travel, Energy, and Air Quality Impacts of Telecommuting","This paper addresses methodological issues in the estimation of travel-related impacts of telecommuting, based on findings from eight telecommuting pilot programs. Several of the studies address energy use (both travel-related and home-based) and one provides information on emissions of air pollutants. These findings are analyzed as well. Travel impacts examined include weekday person- and vehicle-miles saved due to a reduction in commuting, overall weekday travel reductions, and other changes in travel patterns for the telecommuter and the household. Some important issues regarding the estimation of these impacts, their use outside of the pilot programs, and their use in estimating energy savings or reductions in emissions are discussed. In particular, it is cautioned that early, short-term findings from small programs with participants unrepresentative of the population as a whole may change considerably as telecommuting moves into the mainstream."
"JANDREY, Karl E",Comparison of the plateletâ€rich plasma and buffy coat protocols for preparation of canine platelet concentrates,"BackgroundPlatelet (PLT) concentrates (PC) can be produced via the buffy coat (BC) or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) protocols. The 2 methods have not been compared with canine blood.ObjectivesThe aims of the study were to compare the PLT, WBC, and RBC concentrations, in vitro PLT function, and markers of platelet storage lesion (PSL) in canine PC generated by 2 different protocols, and determine microbial growth throughout storage.MethodsPC from 8 healthy donor dogs were produced using 2 standard protocols, PRP and BC. PLT, WBC, and RBC counts, optical aggregometry assays, and PSL markers (pH, pCO2 , HCO3 , lactate and glucose concentrations, and LDH activity) were determined on storage days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were also performed.ResultsMean PLT counts were comparable between protocols and remained stable throughout storage up to day 7, while median WBC and RBC counts on day 0 were significantly higher in the BC-PC group (17,800&nbsp;WBCs/Î¼L; 195,000&nbsp;RBCs/Î¼L) than in the PRP-PC group (200&nbsp;WBCs/Î¼L; 10,000&nbsp;RBCs/Î¼L) (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;.012). In PRP-PC aggregometry, the median slope and amplitude in response to Î³-thrombin and convulxin (+ ADP) were significantly decreased, and virtually absent in BC-PC during storage. PSL markers (lactate, LDH activity) were higher in BC-PC. Aerobic bacterial growth was observed in 2 PRP-PC and 1 BC-PC.ConclusionsThis in vitro study suggests that PRP-PC had lesser WBC and RBC contamination and superior PLT function compared with BC-PC. In vivo studies are required to address safety and efficacy of PRP-PC."

While articles about animal model infectivity have been published for G. duodenalis, the studies have used diverse protocols and parameters to evaluate the infectivity of this protozoan parasite. Hence, the objectives of this study were to (1) conduct a meta-analysis of published literature for cyst shedding and diarrhea outcomes in animal models and (2) develop recommendations to help standardize experimental dose response studies. Results showed that, for the outcome of cyst shedding in faeces, the covariates of infective stage (cyst versus trophozoite), Giardia dose, and the interactions between doses and infective stage, as well as dose and species of experimental host, were all significant (P value â‰¤ 0.05). This study suggests inoculation of the experimental host with cysts rather than trophozoites and administration of higher doses of Giardia will most likely result in cyst shedding. Based on the results of this meta-analysis, the infective stage (cyst versus trophozoite), parasite dose, and the interactions between dose and infective stage, as well as dose and species of experimental host, should be considered when designing experimental dose response studies that will assist in the study of zoonotic neglected tropical diseases globally."
"AMINOLOLAMA-SHAKERI, Shadi",Impact of the California Breast Density Law on Primary Care Physicians,"PurposeTo investigate primary physician awareness of the California Breast Density Notification Law and its impact on primary care practice.MethodsAn online survey was distributed to 174 physicians within a single primary care network system 10 months after California's breast density notification law took effect. The survey assessed physicians' awareness of the law, perceived changes in patient levels of concern about breast density, and physician comfort levels in handling breast density management issues.ResultsThe survey was completed by 77 physicians (45%). Roughly half of those surveyed (49%) reported no knowledge of the breast density notification legislation. Only 32% of respondents noted an increase in patient levels of concern about breast density compared to prior years. The majority were only ""somewhat comfortable"" (55%) or ""not comfortable"" (12%) with breast density questions, and almost one-third (32%) had referred patients to a breast health clinic for these discussions. A total of 75% of those surveyed would be interested in more specific education on the subject.ConclusionsAwareness among primary care clinicians of the California Breast Density Notification Law is low, and many do not feel comfortable answering breast density-related patient questions. Breast imagers and institutions may need to devote additional time and resources to primary physician education in order for density notification laws to have significant impact on patient care."

"MURPHY, William J","Therapeutic Efficacy of Fresh, Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Severe Refractory Gingivostomatitis in Cats","UnlabelledMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a promising therapy for immune-mediated and inflammatory disorders, because of their potent immunomodulatory properties. In this study, we investigated the use of fresh, autologous, adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) for feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS), a chronic, debilitating, idiopathic, oral mucosal inflammatory disease. Nine cats with refractory FCGS were enrolled in this pilot study. Each cat received 2 intravenous injections of 20 million autologous ASCs, 1 month apart. Oral biopsies were taken before and at 6 months after the first ASC injection. Blood immune cell subsets, serum protein, and cytokine levels were measured at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment to assess immunomodulatory effects. Seven of the 9 cats completed the study. Five cats responded to treatment by either complete clinical remission (n=3) or substantial clinical improvement (n=2). Two cats were nonresponders. Cats that responded to treatment also exhibited systemic immunomodulation demonstrated by decreased numbers of circulating CD8+ T cells, a normalization of the CD4/CD8 ratio, decreased neutrophil counts, and interferon-Î³ and interleukin (IL)-1Î² concentration, and a temporary increase in serum IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î± concentration. No clinical recurrence has occurred following complete clinical remission (follow-up of 6-24 months). In this study, cats with <15% cytotoxic CD8 T cells with low expression of CD8 (CD8lo) cells were 100% responsive to ASC therapy, whereas cats with >15% CD8lo cells were nonresponders. The relative absence of CD8lo cells may be a biomarker to predict response to ASC therapy, and may shed light on pathogenesis of FCGS and mechanisms by which ASCs decrease oral inflammation and affect T-cell phenotype.SignificanceThis study is the first to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of fresh, autologous, adipose-derived stem cell systemic therapy for a naturally occurring, chronic inflammatory disease in cats. The findings demonstrate that this therapy resulted in complete clinical and histological resolution or reduction in clinical disease severity and immune modulation in most cats. This study also identified a potentially useful biomarker that could dictate patient enrollment and shed light on immune modulation mechanism. As a naturally occurring animal model, FCGS also provides a strategic platform for potentially translatable therapy for the treatment of human oral inflammatory disease."
"HERTZ-PICCIOTTO, Irva",A Birth Cohort Study of Maternal and Infant Serum PCB-153 and DDE Concentrations and Responses to Infant Tuberculosis Vaccination,"BackgroundReasons for the highly variable and often poor protection conferred by the Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) vaccine are multifaceted and poorly understood.ObjectivesWe aimed to determine whether early-life exposure to PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene] reduces 6-month infant BCG vaccine response.MethodsData came from families participating in a prospective birth cohort in eastern Slovakia. At birth, maternal and cord blood were collected for chemical analyses, and infants were immunized with BCG. Blood was collected from infants for chemical analyses and to determine 6-month BCG-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA levels. Multivariable linear regression models were fit to examine chemical-BCG associations among approximately 500 mother-infant pairs, with adjustment for confounders.ResultsThe median 6-month infant concentration of the prevalent congener PCB-153 was 113 ng/g lipid [interquartile range (IQR): 37-248], and 388 ng/g lipid (IQR: 115-847) for DDE. Higher 6-month infant concentrations of PCB-153 and DDE were strongly associated with lower 6-month BCG-specific antibody levels. For instance, BCG-specific IgG levels were 37% lower for infants with PCB-153 concentrations at the 75th percentile compared to the 25th percentile (95% CI: -42, -32; p < 0.001). Results were similar in magnitude and precision for DDE. There was also evidence of PCB-DDE additivity, where exposure to both compounds reduced anti-BCG levels more than exposure to either compound alone.ConclusionsThe associations observed in this study indicate that environmental exposures may be overlooked contributors to poorer responses to BCG vaccine. The overall association between these exposures and tuberculosis incidence is unknown.CitationJusko TA, De Roos AJ, Lee SY, Thevenet-Morrison K, Schwartz SM, Verner MA, Palkovicova Murinova L, DrobnÃ¡ B, KoÄan A, FabiÅ¡ikovÃ¡ A, ÄŒonka K, Trnovec T, Hertz-Picciotto I, Lawrence BP. 2016.

A field study was conducted that enrolled 139 households from California, which has had more stringent flame retardant requirements than other countries and areas. The study collected passive air, floor and indoor window surface wipes, and dust samples (investigator collected using an HVS3 and vacuum cleaner) in each home. PentaBDE and BDE209 were detected in the majority of the dust samples and many floor wipe samples, but the detection in air and window wipe samples was relatively low. Concentrations of each PBDE congener in different indoor environmental media were moderately correlated, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.42 and 0.68. Correlation coefficients with blood levels were up to 0.65 and varied between environmental media and age group. Both investigator-collected dust and floor wipes were correlated with serum levels for a wide range of congeners. These two sample types also had a relatively high fraction of samples with adequate mass for reliable quantification. In 42 homes, PBDE levels measured in the same environmental media in the same home 1&nbsp;year apart were statistically correlated (correlation coefficients: 0.57-0.90), with the exception of BDE209 which was not well correlated longitudinally."

The model predicts that if I look at the employment (rather than wage) response by skill to immigration in a state, I can estimate the substitutability-complementarity between natives and immigrants. This allows me to infer, other things constant, how immigrants stimulate or depress the demand for native labor. I also use a novel instrument based on demographic characteristics of total Central American migrants or of the Mexican Population to predict immigration by skill level within California. Looking at immigration to California between 1960 and 2005 my estimates support the assumption of a nationally integrated labor market by skill and they support the hypothesis that natives and immigrants in the same education-experience group are not perfectly substitutable. This, in turn, explains the counter-intuitive fact that there is a zero correlation between immigration and wage and employment outcomes of natives."
"PERI, Giovanni",Immigration and Occupations in Europe,"In this paper we analyze the effect of immigrants on natives' job specialization in Western Europe. We test whether the inflow of immigrants changes employment rates or the chosen occupation of natives with similar education and age. We find no evidence of the first and strong evidence of the second: immigrants take more manual-routine type of occupations and push natives towards more abstract-complex jobs, for a given set of observable skills. We also find some evidence that this occupation reallocation is larger in countries with more flexible labor laws. As abstract-complex tasks pay a premium over manual-routine ones, we can evaluate the positive effect of such reallocation on the wages of native workers. Accounting for the total change in Complex/Non Complex task supply from natives and immigrants we find that immigration does not change much the relative compensation of the two types of tasks but it promotes the specialization of natives into the first type."
"PERI, Giovanni",Immigration and the Economy of Cities and Regions,"In this chapter we analyze immigration and its effect on urban and regional economies focusing on productivity and labor markets.  While immigration policies are typically national, the effects of international migrants are often more easily identified on local economies. The reason is that their settlements are significantly concentrated across cities and regions, relative to natives. Immigrants are different from natives in several economically relevant skills. Their impact on the local economy depends on these skills. We emphasize that to evaluate correctly such impact we also need to understand and measure the local adjustments produced by the immigrant flow. Workers and firms take advantage of the opportunities brought by immigrants and respond to them trying to maximize their welfare. We present a common conceptual frame to organize our analysis of the local effects of immigration and we describe several applications. We then discuss the empirical literature that has tried to isolate and identify a causal impact of immigrants on the local economies and to estimate the different margins of response and the resulting outcomes for natives of different skill types. We finally survey promising recent avenues for advancing this research."
"PERI, Giovanni",The Labor Market Impact of Immigration in Western Germany in the 1990â€™s,"We adopt a general equilibrium approach in order to measure the effects of recent immigration on the Western German labor market, looking at both wage and employment effects. Using the Regional File of the IAB Employment Subsample for the period 1987-2001, we find that the substantial immigration of the 1990â€™s had no adverse effects on native wages and employment levels. It had instead adverse employment and wage effects on previous waves of immigrants. This stems from the fact that, after controlling for education and experience levels, native and migrant workers appear to be imperfect substitutes whereas new and old immigrants exhibit perfect substitutability. Our analysis suggests that if the German labor market were as â€˜flexibleâ€™ as the UK labor market, it would be more efficient in dealing with the effects of immigration."

"KLIEBENSTEIN, Daniel J",What Can Causal Networks Tell Us about Metabolic Pathways?,"Graphical models describe the linear correlation structure of data and have been used to establish causal relationships among phenotypes in genetic mapping populations. Data are typically collected at a single point in time. Biological processes on the other hand are often non-linear and display time varying dynamics. The extent to which graphical models can recapitulate the architecture of an underlying biological processes is not well understood. We consider metabolic networks with known stoichiometry to address the fundamental question: ""What can causal networks tell us about metabolic pathways?"". Using data from an Arabidopsis Bay[Formula: see text]Sha population and simulated data from dynamic models of pathway motifs, we assess our ability to reconstruct metabolic pathways using graphical models. Our results highlight the necessity of non-genetic residual biological variation for reliable inference. Recovery of the ordering within a pathway is possible, but should not be expected. Causal inference is sensitive to subtle patterns in the correlation structure that may be driven by a variety of factors, which may not emphasize the substrate-product relationship. We illustrate the effects of metabolic pathway architecture, epistasis and stochastic variation on correlation structure and graphical model-derived networks. We conclude that graphical models should be interpreted cautiously, especially if the implied causal relationships are to be used in the design of intervention strategies."

Controls were frequency matched for gender, age, and smoking history. There were 52 adenocarcinoma cases and 31 controls in ADC1 and 43 adenocarcinoma cases and 43 controls in ADC2. Metabolomics was conducted using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Differential analysis was performed on ADC1 and the top candidates (FDR < 0.05) for serum and plasma used to develop individual and multiplex classifiers that were then tested on an independent set of serum and plasma samples (ADC2).ResultsAspartate provided the best accuracy (81.4%) for an individual metabolite classifier in serum, whereas pyrophosphate had the best accuracy (77.9%) in plasma when independently tested. Multiplex classifiers of either 2 or 4 serum metabolites had an accuracy of 72.7% when independently tested. For plasma, a multimetabolite classifier consisting of 8 metabolites gave an accuracy of 77.3% when independently tested. Comparison of overall diagnostic performance between the two blood matrices yielded similar performances.

"DANDEKAR, Abhaya",Synteny analysis in Rosids with a walnut physical map reveals slow genome evolution in long-lived woody perennials.,"BackgroundMutations often accompany DNA replication. Since there may be fewer cell cycles per year in the germlines of long-lived than short-lived angiosperms, the genomes of long-lived angiosperms may be diverging more slowly than those of short-lived angiosperms. Here we test this hypothesis.ResultsWe first constructed a genetic map for walnut, a woody perennial. All linkage groups were short, and recombination rates were greatly reduced in the centromeric regions. We then used the genetic map to construct a walnut bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone-based physical map, which contained 15,203 exonic BAC-end sequences, and quantified with it synteny between the walnut genome and genomes of three long-lived woody perennials, Vitis vinifera, Populus trichocarpa, and Malus domestica, and three short-lived herbs, Cucumis sativus, Medicago truncatula, and Fragaria vesca. Each measure of synteny we used showed that the genomes of woody perennials were less diverged from the walnut genome than those of herbs. We also estimated the nucleotide substitution rate at silent codon positions in the walnut lineage. It was one-fifth and one-sixth of published nucleotide substitution rates in the Medicago and Arabidopsis lineages, respectively. We uncovered a whole-genome duplication in the walnut lineage, dated it to the neighborhood of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, and allocated the 16 walnut chromosomes into eight homoeologous pairs. We pointed out that during polyploidy-dysploidy cycles, the dominant tendency is to reduce the chromosome number.ConclusionSlow rates of nucleotide substitution are accompanied by slow rates of synteny erosion during genome divergence in woody perennials."
"DANDEKAR, Abhaya",Genome-wide SNP discovery in walnut with an AGSNP pipeline updated for SNP discovery in allogamous organisms,"Abstract Background A genome-wide set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is a valuable resource in genetic research and breeding and is usually developed by re-sequencing a genome. If a genome sequence is not available, an alternative strategy must be used. We previously reported the development of a pipeline (AGSNP) for genome-wide SNP discovery in coding sequences and other single-copy DNA without a complete genome sequence in self-pollinating (autogamous) plants. Here we updated this pipeline for SNP discovery in outcrossing (allogamous) species and demonstrated its efficacy in SNP discovery in walnut (Juglans regia L.). Results The first step in the original implementation of the AGSNP pipeline was the construction of a reference sequence and the identification of single-copy sequences in it. To identify single-copy sequences, multiple genome equivalents of short SOLiD reads of another individual were mapped to shallow genome coverage of long Sanger or Roche 454 reads making up the reference sequence. The relative depth of SOLiD reads was used to filter out repeated sequences from single-copy sequences in the reference sequence. The second step was a search for SNPs between SOLiD reads and the reference sequence. Polymorphism within the mapped SOLiD reads would have precluded SNP discovery; hence both individuals had to be homozygous. The AGSNP pipeline was updated here for using SOLiD or other type of short reads of a heterozygous individual for these two principal steps. A total of 32.6X walnut genome equivalents of SOLiD reads of vegetatively propagated walnut scion cultivar â€˜Chandlerâ€™ were mapped to 48,661 â€˜Chandlerâ€™ bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences (BESs) produced by Sanger sequencing during the construction of a walnut physical map. A total of 22,799 putative SNPs were initially identified. A total of 6,000 Infinium II type SNPs evenly distributed along the walnut physical map were selected for the construction of an Infinium BeadChip, which was used to genotype a walnut mapping population having â€˜Chandlerâ€™ as one of the parents. Genotyping results were used to adjust the filtering parameters of the updated AGSNP pipeline. With the adjusted filtering criteria, 69.6% of SNPs discovered with the updated pipeline were real and could be mapped on the walnut genetic map. A total of 13,439 SNPs were discovered by BES re-sequencing. BESs harboring SNPs were in 677 FPC contigs covering 98% of the physical map of the walnut genome. Conclusion The updated AGSNP pipeline is a versatile SNP discovery tool for a high-throughput, genome-wide SNP discovery in both autogamous and allogamous species. With this pipeline, a large set of SNPs were identified in a single walnut cultivar."
"TURELLI, Michael","ON THE COYNE AND ORRâ€IGIN OF SPECIES: EFFECTS OF INTRINSIC POSTZYGOTIC ISOLATION, ECOLOGICAL DIFFERENTIATION, X CHROMOSOME SIZE, AND SYMPATRY ON DROSOPHILA SPECIATION","Coyne and Orr found that mating discrimination (premating isolation) evolves much faster between sympatric than allopatric Drosophila species pairs. Their meta-analyses established that this pattern, expected under reinforcement, is common and that Haldane's rule is ubiquitous in Drosophila species divergence. We examine three possible contributors to the reinforcement pattern: intrinsic postzygotic isolation, dichotomized as to whether hybrid males show complete inviability/sterility; host-plant divergence, as a surrogate for extrinsic postzygotic isolation; and X chromosome size, whether roughly 20% or 40% of the genome is X-linked. We focus on ""young"" species pairs with overlapping ranges, contrasted with allopatric pairs. Using alternative criteria for ""sympatry"" and tests that compare either level of prezygotic isolation in sympatry or frequency of sympatry, we find no statistically significant effects associated with X chromosome size or our coarse quantifications of intrinsic postzygotic isolation or ecological differentiation. Although sympatric speciation seems very rare in animals, the pervasiveness of the reinforcement pattern and the commonness of range overlap for close relatives indicate that speciation in Drosophila is often not purely allopatric. It remains to determine whether increased premating isolation with sympatry results from secondary contact versus parapatric speciation and what drives this pattern."

"KAPOVICH, Michael",On quasihomomorphisms with noncommutative targets,"We describe structure of quasihomomorphisms from arbitrary groups to discrete groups. We show that all quasihomomorphisms are â€œconstructibleâ€, i.e., are obtained via certain natural operations from homomorphisms to some groups and quasihomomorphisms to abelian groups. We illustrate this theorem by describing quasihomomorphisms to certain classes of groups. For instance, every unbounded quasihomomorphism to a torsion-free hyperbolic group H is either a homomorphism to a subgroup of H or is a quasihomomorphism to an infinite cyclic subgroup of H."

Disruption of the blood-brain barrier is a central feature of HT pathogenesis, and leukocytes may contribute to this process. We sought to determine whether ischemic strokes that develop HT have differences in RNA expression in blood within 3 hours of stroke onset prior to treatment with thrombolytic therapy.MethodsStroke patient blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with thrombolysis, and leukocyte RNA was assessed by microarray analysis. Strokes that developed HT (nâ€‰=â€‰11) were compared to strokes without HT (nâ€‰=â€‰33) and controls (nâ€‰=â€‰14). Genes were identified (corrected pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, fold change â‰¥|1.2|), and functional analysis was performed. RNA prediction of HT in stroke was evaluated using cross-validation, and in a second stroke cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰52).ResultsIschemic strokes that developed HT had differential expression of 29 genes in circulating leukocytes prior to treatment with thrombolytic therapy. A panel of 6 genes could predict strokes that later developed HT with 80% sensitivity and 70.2% specificity. Key pathways involved in HT of human stroke are described, including amphiregulin, a growth factor that regulates matrix metalloproteinase-9; a shift in transforming growth factor-Î² signaling involving SMAD4, INPP5D, and IRAK3; and a disruption of coagulation factors V and VIII.InterpretationIdentified genes correspond to differences in inflammation and coagulation that may predispose to HT in ischemic stroke. Given the adverse impact of HT on stroke outcomes, further evaluation of the identified genes and pathways is warranted to determine their potential as therapeutic targets to reduce HT and as markers of HT risk."
"MOROTTI, Stefano",Î²-adrenergic effects on cardiac myofilaments and contraction in an integrated rabbit ventricular myocyte model,"A five-state model of myofilament contraction was integrated into a well-established rabbit ventricular myocyte model of ion channels, Ca(2+) transporters and kinase signaling to analyze the relative contribution of different phosphorylation targets to the overall mechanical response driven by Î²-adrenergic stimulation (Î²-AS). Î²-AS effect on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) handling, Ca(2+), K(+) and Cl(-) currents, and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase properties was included based on experimental data. The inotropic effect on the myofilaments was represented as reduced myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity (XBCa) and titin stiffness, and increased cross-bridge (XB) cycling rate (XBcy). Assuming independent roles of XBCa and XBcy, the model reproduced experimental Î²-AS responses on action potentials and Ca(2+) transient amplitude and kinetics. It also replicated the behavior of force-Ca(2+), release-restretch, length-step, stiffness-frequency and force-velocity relationships, and increased force and shortening in isometric and isotonic twitch contractions. The Î²-AS effect was then switched off from individual targets to analyze their relative impact on contractility. Preventing Î²-AS effects on L-type Ca(2+) channels or phospholamban limited Ca(2+) transients and contractile responses in parallel, while blocking phospholemman and K(+) channel (IKs) effects enhanced Ca(2+) and inotropy. Removal of Î²-AS effects from XBCa enhanced contractile force while decreasing peak Ca(2+) (due to greater Ca(2+) buffering), but had less effect on shortening. Conversely, preventing Î²-AS effects on XBcy preserved Ca(2+) transient effects, but blunted inotropy (both isometric force and especially shortening). Removal of titin effects had little impact on contraction. Finally, exclusion of Î²-AS from XBCa and XBcy while preserving effects on other targets resulted in preserved peak isometric force response (with slower kinetics) but nearly abolished enhanced shortening. Î²-AS effects on XBCa and XBcy have greater impact on isometric and isotonic contraction, respectively."

breaking in weak semileptonic and $s$-wave nonleptonic hyperon decays. By
defining an expansion sensitive only to $SU(3)$ breaking, we show that the
leading corrections give rise to moderate corrections to $SU(3)$ relations
($\lsim 20\%$), even though the {\it chiral} symmetry $SU(3) \times SU(3)$
appears to be rather badly broken. This explains why $SU(3)$ fits to weak
hyperon decays work well even though chiral-symmetry breaking corrections are
large. Applying these $SU(3)$-breaking corrections to the analysis of the EMC
data, we find that the predicted value of $\bra p\mybar s\gamma_\mu\gamma_5
s\ket p$ is reduced by $\simeq 35\%$, suggesting that the ``EMC effect'' may be
less striking than commonly thought."

"DUBCOVSKY, Jorge",Effect of the Hope FT-B1 Allele on Wheat Heading Time and Yield Components,"Precise regulation of flowering time is critical for plant reproductive success and, in cereals, to maximize grain yields. Seasonal cues including temperature and day length are integrated to regulate the timing of flowering. In temperate cereals, extended periods of cold (vernalization) release the repression of FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (FT1), which is upregulated in the leaves in response to inductive long-day photoperiods. FT1 is a homolog of rice HD3a, which encodes a protein transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem to induce flowering. A rare FT-B1 allele from the wheat variety ""Hope"" has been previously shown to be associated with an early flowering phenotype under long-day photoperiods. Here, we demonstrate that the Hope FT-B1 allele accelerates flowering even under short days, and that it is epistatic to the VERNALIZATION 1 (VRN1) gene. On average, the introgression of Hope FT-B1 into 6 genetic backgrounds resulted in 2.6 days acceleration of flowering (P<0.0001) and 4.1% increase in spike weight (P=0.0093), although in one variety, it was associated with a decrease in spike weight. These results suggest that the Hope FT-B1 allele could be useful in wheat breeding programs to subtly accelerate floral development and increase adaptation to changing environments."
"DUBCOVSKY, Jorge",Analysis of expressed sequence tag loci on wheat chromosome group 4.,"A total of 1918 loci, detected by the hybridization of 938 expressed sequence tag unigenes (ESTs) from 26 Triticeae cDNA libraries, were mapped to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) homoeologous group 4 chromosomes using a set of deletion, ditelosomic, and nulli-tetrasomic lines. The 1918 EST loci were not distributed uniformly among the three group 4 chromosomes; 41, 28, and 31% mapped to chromosomes 4A, 4B, and 4D, respectively. This pattern is in contrast to the cumulative results of EST mapping in all homoeologous groups, as reported elsewhere, that found the highest proportion of loci mapped to the B genome. Sixty-five percent of these 1918 loci mapped to the long arms of homoeologous group 4 chromosomes, while 35% mapped to the short arms. The distal regions of chromosome arms showed higher numbers of loci than the proximal regions, with the exception of 4DL. This study confirmed the complex structure of chromosome 4A that contains two reciprocal translocations and two inversions, previously identified. An additional inversion in the centromeric region of 4A was revealed. A consensus map for homoeologous group 4 was developed from 119 ESTs unique to group 4. Forty-nine percent of these ESTs were found to be homoeologous to sequences on rice chromosome 3, 12% had matches with sequences on other rice chromosomes, and 39% had no matches with rice sequences at all. Limited homology (only 26 of the 119 consensus ESTs) was found between wheat ESTs on homoeologous group 4 and the Arabidopsis genome. Forty-two percent of the homoeologous group 4 ESTs could be classified into functional categories on the basis of blastX searches against all protein databases."
"DUBCOVSKY, Jorge",PCR identification of durum wheat BAC clones containing genes coding for carotenoid biosynthesis enzymes and their chromosome localization,"Carotenoids are essential components in all plants. Their accumulation in wheat seed determines the endosperm colour, which is an important quality trait in wheat. In this study, we report the isolation of BAC clones containing genes coding for three different enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway: phytoene synthase (PSY), phytoene desaturase (PDS), and zeta-carotene desaturase (ZDS). Primers were designed on the basis of wheat ESTs similar to the sequences of these three genes in other species, and used to screen a BAC library from Triticum turgidum var. durum (2n = 28, genomes AABB). Eight, six, and nine 384-well plates containing at least one positive clone were found for PSY, PDS, and ZDS, respectively. BACs selected for each of these genes were then divided in two groups corresponding to the A and B genomes of tetraploid wheat, based on differences in the length of the PCR amplification products, conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE), or cleavage amplification polymorphisms. Positive clones were then assigned to chromosomes using a set of D genome substitution lines in T. turgidum var. durum 'Langdon'. PSY clones were localized on chromosomes 5A and 5B, PDS on chromosomes 4A and 4B, and ZDS on chromosomes 2A and 2B. The strategies used for the PCR screening of large BAC libraries and for the differentiation of BAC clones from different genomes in a polyploid species are discussed."
"KORF, Ian",Comparative and functional analysis of intron-mediated enhancement signals reveals conserved features among plants,"Introns in a wide range of organisms including plants, animals and fungi are able to increase the expression of the gene that they are contained in. This process of intron-mediated enhancement (IME) is most thoroughly studied in Arabidopsis thaliana, where it has been shown that enhancing introns are typically located near the promoter and are compositionally distinct from downstream introns. In this study, we perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of several sequenced plant genomes. We find that enhancing sequences are conserved in the multi-cellular plants but are either absent or unrecognizable in algae. IME signals are preferentially located towards the 5'-end of first introns but also appear to be enriched in 5'-UTRs and coding regions near the transcription start site. Enhancing introns are found most prominently in genes that are highly expressed in a wide range of tissues. Through site-directed mutagenesis in A. thaliana, we show that IME signals can be inserted or removed from introns to increase or decrease gene expression. Although we do not yet know the specific mechanism of IME, the predicted signals appear to be both functional and highly conserved."

In this study, we carried out a gene co-expression analysis of all currently publicly available microarray data, which were generated in experiments that studied the interaction of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with microbial pathogens. This work was conducted to identify (i) modules of functionally related co-expressed genes that are differentially expressed in response to multiple biotic stresses, and (ii) hub genes that may function as core regulators of disease responses. Using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) we constructed an undirected network leveraging a rich curated expression dataset comprising 272 microarrays that involved microbial infections of Arabidopsis plants with a wide array of fungal and bacterial pathogens with biotrophic, hemibiotrophic, and necrotrophic lifestyles. WGCNA produced a network with scale-free and small-world properties composed of 205 distinct clusters of co-expressed genes. Modules of functionally related co-expressed genes that are differentially regulated in response to multiple pathogens were identified by integrating differential gene expression testing with functional enrichment analyses of gene ontology terms, known disease associated genes, transcriptional regulators, and cis-regulatory elements. The significance of functional enrichments was validated by comparisons with randomly generated networks. Network topology was then analyzed to identify intra- and inter-modular gene hubs. Based on high connectivity, and centrality in meta-modules that are clearly enriched in defense responses, we propose a list of 66 target genes for reverse genetic experiments to further dissect the Arabidopsis immune system. Our results show that statistical-based data trimming prior to network analysis allows the integration of expression datasets generated by different groups, under different experimental conditions and biological systems, into a functionally meaningful co-expression network."

The superior temporal gyrus is involved in auditory processing and social cognition and its pathology has been correlated with autism.

In the current study, we examined the impact of brain-reactive maternal autoantibodies of mothers of children with autism (MAU) on offspring behavior in mice compared to offspring exposed to non-reactive IgG of mothers of typically developing children (MTD). Embryonic offspring were exposed to a single intraventricular injection of MAU or MTD IgG on embryonic day 14. Offspring were allowed to mature to adulthood and were subsequently tested for sociability and stereotypic behaviors using a 3-chambered social approach task, marble burying task, and assessment of spontaneous grooming behaviors in response to a novel environment. Results indicate that MAU offspring display autistic-like stereotypical behavior in both marble burying and spontaneous grooming behaviors. Additionally, small alterations in social approach behavior were also observed in MAU offspring compared to MTD offspring. This report demonstrates for the first time the effects of a single, low dose intraventricular exposure of IgG derived from individual MAU samples on offspring behavior."

Parents completed a post-visit questionnaire to report discussions on weight, nutrition, and physical activity that occurred during the visit. Electronic health records were reviewed to measure documentation of these topics during the visit. Parental reports and records were compared with actual discussions on the basis of coded audiotapes. Counseling was coded as having occurred if specific topics were mentioned during the encounter, however brief this mention was.ResultsA total of 48% of the children were female, they were a mean age of 5.4 years, and 28% were overweight or obese. Sensitivity of parental report was high (63%-96%), but specificity was low (43%-77%) because of parents' tendency to overreport counseling. Sensitivity of electronic health record documentation was generally low (40%-53%) except for discussion of screen time (92%) and physical activity (88%); the specificity of these data was also poor (42% and 21%, respectively, for screen time and physical activity).ConclusionsElectronic health record documentation may not be the most valid method of measuring physician counseling on weight, nutrition, and physical activity in pediatric primary care. Parental report via the use of a questionnaire administered immediately after the visit is a better alternative in quality improvement or research studies when resources do not allow for direct observation, with the caveat that parents may overreport whether counseling was provided."

To control for potential confounding effects of diet- or microbiome-derived molecules on the systemic metabolome, sampling was during a tightly-controlled feeding test week paradigm. Pairwise and multivariate analysis revealed intervention- and insulin-sensitivity associated: (1) Changes in plasma xeno-metabolites (""non-self"" metabolites of dietary or gut microbial origin) following an oral glucose tolerance test (e.g. higher post-OGTT propane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate [tricarballylic acid]) or in the overnight-fasted state (e.g., lower Î³-tocopherol); (2) Increased indices of saturated very long chain fatty acid elongation capacity; (3) Increased post-OGTT Î±-ketoglutaric acid (Î±-KG), fasting Î±-KG inversely correlated with Matsuda index, and altered patterns of malate, pyruvate and glutamine hypothesized to stem from improved mitochondrial efficiency and more robust oxidation of glucose. The results support a working model in which improved metabolic health modifies host metabolism in parallel with altering systemic exposure to xeno-metabolites. This highlights that interpretations regarding the origins of peripheral blood or urinary ""signatures"" of insulin resistance and metabolic health must consider the potentially important contribution of gut-derived metabolites toward the host's metabolome."

For certain supersymmetric two charge black holes these corrections drastically alter the causal structure of the solution, converting seemingly pathological null singularities into timelike singularities hidden behind a finite area horizon. We establish, analytically and numerically, that the string-corrected two-charge black hole metric has the same Penrose diagram as the extremal four-charge black hole. The higher derivative terms lead to another dramatic effect -- the gravitational force exerted by a black hole on an inertial observer is no longer purely attractive! The magnitude of this effect is related to the size of the compactification manifold."

By interfacing genome-wide sequencing of transcripts and ChIP-seq analyses, we uncover a network of repressed genes and distinct histone modifications at target gene promoters that are developmentally regulated by the NuRD complex in the cerebellum in&nbsp;vivo. Finally, in a targeted in&nbsp;vivo RNAi screen of NuRD target genes, we identify a program of NuRD-repressed genes that operate as critical regulators of presynaptic differentiation in the cerebellar cortex. Our findings define NuRD-dependent promoter decommissioning as a developmentally regulated programming mechanism that drives synaptic connectivity in the mammalian brain."

"KEBREAB, Ermias",A dynamic growth model for prediction of nutrient partitioning and manure production in growing-finishing pigs: Model development and evaluation.,"Nutrient loading and air emissions from swine operations raise environmental concerns. The objective of the study was to describe and evaluate a mathematical model (Davis Swine Model) of nutrient partitioning and predict manure excretion and composition on a daily basis. State variables of the model were AA, fatty acids, and a central pool of metabolites that supplied substrate for lipid synthesis and oxidation. The model traced the fate of ingested nutrients and water through digestion and intermediary metabolism into body protein, fat, water, and ash, where body protein and fat represented the body constituent pools. It was assumed that fluxes of metabolites follow saturation kinetics, depending on metabolite concentrations. The main inputs to the model were diet nutrient composition, feed intake, water-to-feed ratio, and initial BW. First, the model was challenged with nutrient partitioning data and then with excretion data. The data had 48 different feeding regimes with contrasting energy and lysine intakes at 2 different stages of growth. The overall observed and predicted mean were 109 and 112 g/d for protein deposition and 132 and 136 g/d for lipid deposition respectively, suggesting minor mean bias. Root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) was used in evaluation of the model for its predictive power. The overall RMSPE was 2.2 and 4.1 g/d for protein and lipid deposition, respectively. The excretion database used for evaluation of the model was constructed from 150 digestibility trials using growing-finishing pig diets that had a wide range of nutrient chemical composition. Nutrient and water excretion were quantified using the principle of mass conservation. The average daily observed and predicted manure production was 3.79 and 3.99 kg/d, respectively, with a RMSPE of 0.49 kg/d. There was a good agreement between observed and predicted mean fecal N output (9.9 and 9.8 g/d, respectively). Similarly, the overall observed and predicted mean urine N output was 21.7 and 21.3 g/d, respectively, suggesting minor mean bias. The RMSPE was 1.9 and 4.1 g/d for fecal and urinary N, respectively. Evaluation of the model showed that the model predicts manure excretion and N content well and can be used to assess environmental mitigation options from swine operations."
"KEBREAB, Ermias",Determination of protein and amino acid requirements of lactating sows using a population-based factorial approach,"Determination of appropriate nutritional requirements is essential to optimize the productivity and longevity of lactating sows. The current recommendations for requirements do not consider the large variation between animals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the amino acid recommendations for lactating sows using a stochastic modeling approach that integrates population variation and uncertainty of key parameters into establishing nutritional recommendations for lactating sows. The requirement for individual sows was calculated using a factorial approach by adding the requirement for maintenance and milk. The energy balance of the sows was either negative or zero depending on feed intake being a limiting factor. Some parameters in the model were sow-specific and others were population-specific, depending on state of knowledge. Each simulation was for 1000 sows repeated 100 times using Monte Carlo simulation techniques. BW, back fat thickness of the sow, litter size (LS), average litter gain (LG), dietary energy density and feed intake were inputs to the model. The model was tested using results from the literature, and the values were all within Â±1 s.d. of the estimated requirements. Simulations were made for a group of low- (LS=10 (s.d.=1), LG=2 kg/day (s.d.=0.6)), medium- (LS=12 (s.d.=1), LG=2.5 kg/day (s.d.=0.6)) and high-producing (LS=14 (s.d.=1), LG=3.5 kg/day (s.d.=0.6)) sows, where the average requirement was the result. In another simulation, the requirements were estimated for each week of lactation. The results were given as the median and s.d. The average daily standardized ileal digestible (SID) protein and lysine requirements for low-, medium- and high-producing sows were 623 (CV=2.5%) and 45.1 (CV=4.8%); 765 (CV=4.9%) and 54.7 (CV=7.0%); and 996 (CV=8.5%) and 70.8 g/day (CV=9.6%), respectively. The SID protein and lysine requirements were lowest at week 1, intermediate at week 2 and 4 and the highest at week 3 of lactation. The model is a valuable tool to develop new feeding strategies by taking into account the variable requirement between groups of sows and changes during lactation. The inclusion of between-sow variation gives information on safety margins when developing new dietary recommendations of amino acids and protein for lactating sows."

Naturally occurring diseases in large animal species may serve as surrogate animal models of human disease, as they may better reflect the complex genetic, environmental, and physiologic variation present in outbred populations. We work with naturally occurring diseases in large animal species to better understand how MSCs work and to facilitate optimal translation of MSC-based therapies. We are investigating the use of MSC therapy for a chronic oral inflammatory disease in cats. During our efforts to expand fat-derived feline MSCs (fMSCs), we observed thatâˆ¼50% of the cell lines developed giant foamy multinucleated cells in later passages. These morphologic alterations were associated with proliferation arrest. We hypothesized that the cytopathic effects were caused by infection with a retrovirus, feline foamy virus (FFV). Using transmission electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction, and in vitro assays, we determined that syncytial cell formation and proliferation arrest in fMSCs were caused by FFV strains that were highly homologous to previously reported FFV strains. We determined that the antiretroviral drug, tenofovir, may be used to support ex vivo expansion and salvage of FFV-infected fMSC lines. MSC lines derived from specific pathogen-free cats do not appear to be infected with FFV and may be a source of allogeneic fMSCs for clinical application. FFV infection of fMSC lines may hinder large-scale expansion of autologous MSC for therapeutic use in feline patients."

"HENRY, Isabelle",Reference genome-independent assessment of mutation density using restriction enzyme-phased sequencing,"Abstract Background The availability of low cost sequencing has spurred its application to discovery and typing of variation, including variation induced by mutagenesis. Mutation discovery is challenging as it requires a substantial amount of sequencing and analysis to detect very rare changes and distinguish them from noise. Also challenging are the cases when the organism of interest has not been sequenced or is highly divergent from the reference. Results We describe the development of a simple method for reduced representation sequencing. Input DNA was digested with a single restriction enzyme and ligated to Y adapters modified to contain a sequence barcode and to provide a compatible overhang for ligation. We demonstrated the efficiency of this method at SNP discovery using rice and arabidopsis. To test its suitability for the discovery of very rare SNP, one control and three mutagenized rice individuals (1, 5 and 10 mM sodium azide) were used to prepare genomic libraries for Illumina sequencers by ligating barcoded adapters to NlaIII restriction sites. For genome-dependent discovery 15-30 million of 80 base reads per individual were aligned to the reference sequence achieving individual sequencing coverage from 7 to 15Ã—. We identified high-confidence base changes by comparing sequences across individuals and identified instances consistent with mutations, i.e. changes that were found in a single treated individual and were solely GC to AT transitions. For genome-independent discovery 70-mers were extracted from the sequence of the control individual and single-copy sequence was identified by comparing the 70-mers across samples to evaluate copy number and variation. This de novo ""genome"" was used to align the reads and identify mutations as above. Covering approximately 1/5 of the 380 Mb genome of rice we detected mutation densities ranging from 0.6 to 4 per Mb of diploid DNA depending on the mutagenic treatment. Conclusions The combination of a simple and cost-effective library construction method, with Illumina sequencing, and the use of a bioinformatic pipeline allows practical SNP discovery regardless of whether a genomic reference is available."

"STERGIOPOULOS, Ioannis",Evolution of Mycosphaerella fijiensis effectors,"Previously, we have determined the nonhost-mediated recognition of the MfAvr4 and MfEcp2 effector proteins from the banana pathogen Mycosphaerella fijiensis in tomato, by the cognate Cf-4 and Cf-Ecp2 resistance proteins, respectively. These two resistance proteins could thus mediate resistance against M.â€‰fijiensis if genetically transformed into banana (Musa spp.). However, disease resistance controlled by single dominant genes can be overcome by mutated effector alleles, whose products are not recognized by the cognate resistance proteins. Here, we surveyed the allelic variation within the MfAvr4, MfEcp2, MfEcp2-2 and MfEcp2-3 effector genes of M.â€‰fijiensis in a global population of the pathogen, and assayed its impact on recognition by the tomato Cf-4 and Cf-Ecp2 resistance proteins, respectively. We identified a large number of polymorphisms that could reflect a co-evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen. The analysis of nucleotide substitution patterns suggests that both positive selection and intragenic recombination have shaped the evolution of M.â€‰fijiensis effectors. Clear differences in allelic diversity were observed between strains originating from South-East Asia relative to strains from other banana-producing continents, consistent with the hypothesis that M.â€‰fijiensis originated in the Asian-Pacific region. Furthermore, transient co-expression of the MfAvr4 effector alleles and the tomato Cf-4 resistance gene, as well as of MfEcp2, MfEcp2-2 and MfEcp2-3 and the putative Cf-Ecp2 resistance gene, indicated that effector alleles able to overcome these resistance genes are already present in natural populations of the pathogen, thus questioning the durability of resistance that can be provided by these genes in the field."

Compared to parents, adolescents reported that social skills were less important. Additionally, adolescents reported that they engaged in social skills more frequently than parents reported them to be engaging in social skills. Parents, but not adolescents, reported a discrepancy between importance and engagement, such that the importance of social skills was rated higher than the frequency of adolescent engagement in social skills. These results suggest that social skills interventions for individuals with ASD may need to target awareness of social skill importance and accurate monitoring of social skill engagement."

Compared with other strains of mice, EAE in the SJL mouse strain models multiple features of MS, including an enhanced sensitivity of female mice to disease; however, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the sex- and strain-dependent differences in disease susceptibility have not been described. We identified sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) as a sex- and strain-specific, disease-modifying molecule that regulates BBB permeability by destabilizing adherens junctions. S1PR2 expression was increased in disease-susceptible regions of the CNS of both female SJL EAE mice and female patients with MS compared with their male counterparts. Pharmacological blockade or lack of S1PR2 signaling decreased EAE disease severity as the result of enhanced endothelial barrier function. Enhanced S1PR2 signaling in an in vitro BBB model altered adherens junction formation via activation of Rho/ROCK, CDC42, and caveolin endocytosis-dependent pathways, resulting in loss of apicobasal polarity and relocation of abluminal CXCL12 to vessel lumina. Furthermore, S1PR2-dependent BBB disruption and CXCL12 relocation were observed in vivo. These results identify a link between S1PR2 signaling and BBB polarity and implicate S1PR2 in sex-specific patterns of disease during CNS autoimmunity."

A central reaction in the cycle involves the reduction of nitrate (NO(-) 3) to nitrite (NO(-) 2) catalyzed by nitrate reductase (NR). Discrimination against (15)N by NR is a major determinant of isotopic differences among N pools. Here, we measured in vitro (15)N discrimination by several NRs purified from plants, fungi, and a bacterium to determine the intrinsic (15)N discrimination by the enzyme and to evaluate the validity of measurements made using (15)N-enriched NO(-) 3. Observed NR isotope discrimination ranged from 22 to 32â€° (kinetic isotope effects of 1.022-1.032) among the different isozymes at natural abundance (15)N (0.37%). As the fractional (15)N content of substrate NO(-) 3 increased from natural abundance, the product (15)N fraction deviated significantly from that expected based on substrate enrichment and (15)N discrimination measured at natural abundance. Additionally, isotopic discrimination by denitrifying bacteria used to reduce NO(-) 3 and NO(-) 2 in some protocols became a greater source of error as (15)N enrichment increased. We briefly discuss potential causes of the experimental artifacts with enriched (15)N and recommend against the use of highly enriched (15)N tracers to study N discrimination in plants or soils."

"BECKLES, Diane M","Effects of Timing and Severity of Salinity Stress on Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Yield, Grain Composition, and Starch Functionality","The aim of this work was to examine agronomic, compositional, and functional changes in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) grains from plants grown under low-to-moderate salinity stress in the greenhouse. Plants were grown in sodium chloride-containing soil (2 or 4 dS/m(2) electrical conductivity), which was imposed 4-weeks after transplant (called Seedling EC2 and EC4) or after the appearance of the anthers (called Anthesis EC2 and EC4). The former simulates field conditions while the latter permits observation of the isolated effect of salt on grain filling processes. Key findings of this study are the following: (i) Plants showed adaptive responses to prolonged salt treatment with no negative effects on grain weight or fertility. Seedling EC2 plants had more panicles and enhanced caryopsis dimensions, while surprisingly, Seedling EC4 plants did not differ from the control group in the agronomic parameters measured. (ii) Grain starch increased in Seedling EC4 (32.6%) and Anthesis EC2 (39%), respectively, suggesting a stimulatory effect of salt on starch accumulation. (iii) The salinity treatment of 2 dS/m(2) was better tolerated at anthesis than the 4 dS/m(2) treatment as the latter led to reduced grain weight (28.8%) and seed fertility (19.4%) and compensatory increases in protein (20.1%) and nitrogen (19.8%) contents. (iv) Although some salinity treatments led to changes in starch content, these did not alter starch fine structure, morphology, or composition. We observed no differences in reducing sugar and amylose content or starch granule size distribution among any of the treatments. The only alterations in starch were limited to small changes in thermal properties and glucan chain distribution, which were only seen in the Anthesis EC4 treatment. This similarity of compositional and functional features was supported by multivariate analysis of all variables measured, which suggested that differences due to treatments were minimal. Overall, this study documents the specific response of rice under defined conditions, and illustrates that the plasticity of plant response to mild stress is complex and highly context-dependent, even under greenhouse conditions in which other potential environmental stress impacts are minimized."

"GARBELOTTO BENZON, NH Matteo M MM",Phenotypic Diversification Is Associated with Host-Induced Transposon Derepression in the Sudden Oak Death Pathogen Phytophthora ramorum,"The oomycete pathogen Phytophthora ramorum is responsible for sudden oak death (SOD) in California coastal forests. P. ramorum is a generalist pathogen with over 100 known host species. Three or four closely related genotypes of P. ramorum (from a single lineage) were originally introduced in California forests and the pathogen reproduces clonally. Because of this the genetic diversity of P. ramorum is extremely low in Californian forests. However, P. ramorum shows diverse phenotypic variation in colony morphology, colony senescence, and virulence. In this study, we show that phenotypic variation among isolates is associated with the host species from which the microbe was originally cultured. Microarray global mRNA profiling detected derepression of transposable elements (TEs) and down-regulation of crinkler effector homologs (CRNs) in the majority of isolates originating from coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), but this expression pattern was not observed in isolates from California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica). In some instances, oak and bay laurel isolates originating from the same geographic location had identical genotypes based on multilocus simples sequence repeat (SSR) marker analysis but had different phenotypes. Expression levels of the two marker genes analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR were correlated with originating host species, but not with multilocus genotypes. Because oak is a nontransmissive dead-end host for P. ramorum, our observations are congruent with an epi-transposon hypothesis; that is, physiological stress is triggered on P. ramorum while colonizing oak stems and disrupts epigenetic silencing of TEs. This then results in TE reactivation and possibly genome diversification without significant epidemiological consequences. We propose the P. ramorum-oak host system in California forests as an ad hoc model for epi-transposon mediated diversification."

The resulting sequence and assembly was used to generate a draft genome spanning 23.2 Gbp and containing 20.1 Gbp with an N50 scaffold size of 66.9 kbp, making it a significant improvement over available conifer genomes. The long scaffold lengths allow the annotation of 50,172 gene models with intron lengths averaging over 2.7 kbp and sometimes exceeding 100 kbp in length. Analysis of orthologous gene sets identifies gene families that may be unique to conifers. We further characterize and expand the existing repeat library based on the de novo analysis of the repetitive content, estimated to encompass 82% of the genome.ConclusionsIn addition to its value as a resource for researchers and breeders, the loblolly pine genome sequence and assembly reported here demonstrates a novel approach to sequencing the large and complex genomes of this important group of plants that can now be widely applied."

"WAINWRIGHT, Peter",Nocturnality constrains morphological and functional diversity in the eyes of reef fishes,"Abstract Background Ambient light levels are often considered to drive the evolution of eye form and function. Diel activity pattern is the main mechanism controlling the visual environment of teleost reef fish, with day-active (diurnal) fish active in well-illuminated conditions, whereas night-active (nocturnal) fish cope with dim light. Physiological optics predicts several specific evolutionary responses to dim-light vision that should be reflected in visual performance features of the eye. Results We analyzed a large comparative dataset on morphological traits of the eyes in 265 species of teleost reef fish in 43 different families. The eye morphology of nocturnal reef teleosts is characterized by a syndrome that indicates better light sensitivity, including large relative eye size, high optical ratio and large, rounded pupils. Improved dim-light image formation comes at the cost of reduced depth of focus and reduction of potential accommodative lens movement. Diurnal teleost reef fish, released from the stringent functional requirements of dim-light vision have much higher morphological and optical diversity than nocturnal species, with large ranges of optical ratio, depth of focus, and lens accommodation. Conclusions Physical characteristics of the environment are an important factor in the evolution and diversification of the vertebrate eye. Both teleost reef fish and terrestrial amniotes meet the functional requirements of dim-light vision with a similar evolutionary response of morphological and optical modifications. The trade-off between improved dim-light vision and reduced optical diversity may be a key factor in explaining the lower trophic diversity of nocturnal reef teleosts."

"LEBRILLA, Carlito B",Variation in Consumption of Human Milk Oligosaccharides by Infant Gut-Associated Strains of Bifidobacterium breve,"Human milk contains a high concentration of complex oligosaccharides that influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota in breast-fed infants. Previous studies have indicated that select species such as Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis and Bifidobacterium bifidum can utilize human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) in vitro as the sole carbon source, while the relatively few B. longum subsp. longum and Bifidobacterium breve isolates tested appear less adapted to these substrates. Considering the high frequency at which B. breve is isolated from breast-fed infant feces, we postulated that some B. breve strains can more vigorously consume HMO and thus are enriched in the breast-fed infant gastrointestinal tract. To examine this, a number of B. breve isolates from breast-fed infant feces were characterized for the presence of different glycosyl hydrolases that participate in HMO utilization, as well as by their ability to grow on HMO or specific HMO species such as lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) and fucosyllactose. All B. breve strains showed high levels of growth on LNT and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT), and, in general, growth on total HMO was moderate for most of the strains, with several strain differences. Growth and consumption of fucosylated HMO were strain dependent, mostly in isolates possessing a glycosyl hydrolase family 29 Î±-fucosidase. Glycoprofiling of the spent supernatant after HMO fermentation by select strains revealed that all B. breve strains can utilize sialylated HMO to a certain extent, especially sialyl-lacto-N-tetraose. Interestingly, this specific oligosaccharide was depleted before neutral LNT by strain SC95. In aggregate, this work indicates that the HMO consumption phenotype in B. breve is variable; however, some strains display specific adaptations to these substrates, enabling more vigorous consumption of fucosylated and sialylated HMO. These results provide a rationale for the predominance of this species in breast-fed infant feces and contribute to a more accurate picture of the ecology of the developing infant intestinal microbiota."

Despite the significant progress in imaging cone and rod photoreceptor mosaics, visualization of cellular structures in the inner retina has been achieved only with extrinsic contrast agents that have not been approved for use with humans. In this paper we describe the main limiting factors in visualizing inner retinal cells and the methods we implemented to reduce their effects on images acquired with AO-OCT. These include improving the system point spread function (AO performance), monitoring of motion artifacts (retinal motion tracking), and speckle pattern reduction (temporal and spatial averaging). Results of imaging inner retinal morphology and the improvement offered by the new UC Davis AOOCT system with spatio-temporal image averaging are presented.

Soil boxes (0.5 m wide X 1.1 m long X 0.3 m deep) were used to evaluate the ability of grass vegetated buffer strips to retain 2 X 101 spiked C parvum oocysts in 200-g fecal deposits during simulated rainfall intensities of 30 to 47.5 mm/h over 2 h. Buffers were comprised of Ahwahnee sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Mollic Haploxeralfs; 78:18:4 sand to silt to clay ratio; dry bulk density = 1.4 g/cm(3)) set at 5 to 20% land slope, and greater than or equal to95% grass cover (grass stubble height = 10 cm; biomass = 900 kg/ha dry weight). Total number of oocysts discharged from each soil box (combined overland and subsurface flow) during the 120-min simulation ranged from 1.5 X 10(6) to 23.9 X 10(6) oocysts. Observed overall mean log(10), reduction of total C. parvum flux per meter of vegetated buffer was 1.44, 1.19, and 1.18 for buffers at 5, 12, and 20% land slope, respectively. Rainfall application rate (mm/h) was strongly associated with oocyst flux from these vegetated buffers, resulting in a decrease of 2 to 4% in the log(10) reduction per meter buffer for every additional mm/h applied to the soil box. These results support the use of strategically placed vegetated buffers as one of several management strategies that can reduce the risk of waterborne C. parvum attributable to extensive cattle grazing on annual grassland watersheds."
"HARTER, Thomas",Microbial Groundwater Sampling Protocol for Fecalâ€Rich Environments,"Inherently, confined animal farming operations (CAFOs) and other intense fecal-rich environments are potential sources of groundwater contamination by enteric pathogens. The ubiquity of microbial matter poses unique technical challenges in addition to economic constraints when sampling wells in such environments. In this paper, we evaluate a groundwater sampling protocol that relies on extended purging with a portable submersible stainless steel pump and Teflon(Â®) tubing as an alternative to equipment sterilization. The protocol allows for collecting a large number of samples quickly, relatively inexpensively, and under field conditions with limited access to capacity for sterilizing equipment. The protocol is tested on CAFO monitoring wells and considers three cross-contamination sources: equipment, wellbore, and ambient air. For the assessment, we use Enterococcus, a ubiquitous fecal indicator bacterium (FIB), in laboratory and field tests with spiked and blank samples, and in an extensive, multi-year field sampling campaign on 17 wells within 2 CAFOs. The assessment shows that extended purging can successfully control for equipment cross-contamination, but also controls for significant contamination of the well-head, within the well casing and within the immediate aquifer vicinity of the well-screen. Importantly, our tests further indicate that Enterococcus is frequently entrained in water samples when exposed to ambient air at a CAFO during sample collection. Wellbore and air contamination pose separate challenges in the design of groundwater monitoring strategies on CAFOs that are not addressed by equipment sterilization, but require adequate QA/QC procedures and can be addressed by the proposed sampling strategy."

"HEYER, Wolf D",A truncated DNA-damage-signaling response is activated after DSB formation in the G1 phase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the DNA damage response (DDR) is activated by the spatio-temporal colocalization of Mec1-Ddc2 kinase and the 9-1-1 clamp. In the absence of direct means to monitor Mec1 kinase activation in vivo, activation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53 has been taken as a proxy for DDR activation. Here, we identify serine 378 of the Rad55 recombination protein as a direct target site of Mec1. Rad55-S378 phosphorylation leads to an electrophoretic mobility shift of the protein and acts as a sentinel for Mec1 activation in vivo. A single double-stranded break (DSB) in G1-arrested cells causes phosphorylation of Rad55-S378, indicating activation of Mec1 kinase. However, Rad53 kinase is not detectably activated under these conditions. This response required Mec1-Ddc2 and loading of the 9-1-1 clamp by Rad24-RFC, but not Rad9 or Mrc1. In addition to Rad55-S378, two additional direct Mec1 kinase targets are phosphorylated, the middle subunit of the ssDNA-binding protein RPA, RPA2 and histone H2A (H2AX). These data suggest the existence of a truncated signaling pathway in response to a single DSB in G1-arrested cells that activates Mec1 without eliciting a full DDR involving the entire signaling pathway including the effector kinases."

Data are available on the status of 11 joints of each of 21 patients before, during and after treatment with Accutane. These are compared with data obtained by questionnaire from 40 untreated patients to determine the efficacy of the treatment. Both left- and right-censoring are present in each group, which, together with the multivariate nature of the data and the time-dependent treatment covariate, makes analysis difficult. We consider two alternative parametric models for incorporating within-subject dependence: a marginal model and a frailty model. Both analyses suggest that Accutane treatment is effective. We discuss and illustrate the differences between the two approaches. We also discuss the extent to which the conclusions are compromised by the observational nature of the study."

To determine the relationship of dental procedures to immediate ossification and arlkylosis of the jaw in patients who have fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Study design. A mail survey was conducted of the 60 patient-members of the International Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva Association. All 41 patients (18 males, 23 females) who responded were examined. Instantaneous exact hazard rates for ossification of the jaw were calculated by the Weibull model. Results. Thirty-six patients had dental procedures performed. Twenty-one (58%) patients had received an injection of local anesthetic. Five (24%) patients had an immediate flare-up of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva with ossification and permanent ankylosis of the jaw (expected occurrence, 0.031; P < 0.0001). None of the 12 patients who had comparable dental work without injections developed heterotopic ossification (expected occurrence, 0.019; not significant). Conclusion. Injections of local anesthetic during dental procedures pose serious and immediate risk for inciting heterotopic ossification and ankylosis of the jaw in patients who have fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva and should be assiduously avoided."

Custom, ultrahigh-resolution imaging modalities were used to evaluate segmented retinal layer thickness in 3D volumes (Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography), cone photoreceptor density (adaptive optics fundus camera), and the length of inner and outer segments of cone photoreceptors (adaptive optics-optical coherence tomography). Quantitative comparisons were made with age-matched controls, or by comparing affected and nonaffected retinal areas defined by changes in visual fields. The integrity of outer retinal layers on optical coherence tomography B-scans and density of cone photoreceptors were correlated with visual field sensitivity at corresponding retinal locations following reductions in inner retinal thickness. The photoreceptor outer segments were shorter and exhibited greater variability in retinal areas associated with visual field losses compared with normal or less affected areas of the same patient's visual field. These results demonstrate that nonglaucomatous and glaucomatous optic neuropathies are associated with outer retinal changes following long-term inner retinal pathology."

We hypothesized that NO homeostasis in the airway is important to control inflammation, which requires upregulation, of NOS2 protein expression by an NOS3-dependent mechanism.Materials or subjectsMice from a C57BL/6 wild-type, NOS1(-/-), NOS2(-/-), and NOS3(-/-) genotypes were used. All mice strains were systemically sensitized and exposed to filtered air or ovalbumin (OVA) aerosol for two weeks to create a subchronic model of allergen-induced airway inflammation.MethodsWe measured lung function, lung lavage inflammatory and airway epithelial goblet cell count, exhaled NO, nitrate and nitrite concentration, and airway NOS1, NOS2, and NOS3 protein content.ResultsDeletion of NOS1 or NOS3 increases NOS2 protein present in the airway epithelium and smooth muscle of air-exposed animals. Exposure to allergen significantly reduced the expression of NOS2 protein in the airway epithelium and smooth muscle of the NOS3(-/-) strain only. This reduction in NOS2 expression was not due to the replacement of epithelial cells with goblet cells as remaining epithelial cells did not express NOS2. NOS1(-/-) animals had significantly reduced goblet cell metaplasia compared to C57Bl/6 wt, NOS2(-/-), and NOS3(-/-) allergen-exposed mice.ConclusionThe airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells maintain a stable airway NO concentration under noninflammatory conditions. This ""homeostatic"" mechanism is unable to distinguish between NOS derived from the different constitutive NOS isoforms. NOS3 is essential for the expression of NOS2 under inflammatory conditions, while NOS1 expression contributes to allergen-induced goblet cell metaplasia."
"HOVEY, Russ",Neoplastic transformation of porcine mammary epithelial cells in vitro and tumor formation in vivo,"BackgroundThe mammary glands of pigs share many functional and morphological similarities with the breasts of humans, raising the potential of their utility for research into the mechanisms underlying normal mammary function and breast carcinogenesis. Here we sought to establish a model for the efficient manipulation and transformation of porcine mammary epithelial cells (pMEC) in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.MethodsWe utilized a vector encoding the red florescent protein tdTomato to transduce populations of pMEC from Yorkshire -Hampshire crossbred female pigs in vitro and in vivo. Populations of primary pMEC were then separated by FACS using markers to distinguish epithelial cells (CD140a-) from stromal cells (CD140a+), with or without further enrichment for basal and luminal progenitor cells (CD49f+). These separated pMEC populations were transduced by lentivirus encoding murine polyomavirus T antigens (Tag) and tdTomato and engrafted to orthotopic or ectopic sites in immunodeficient NOD.Cg-Prkdc (scid) Il2rg (tm1Wjl) /SzJ (NSG) mice.ResultsWe demonstrated that lentivirus effectively transduces pMEC in vitro and in vivo. We further established that lentivirus can be used for oncogenic-transformation of pMEC ex vivo for generating mammary tumors in vivo. Oncogenic transformation was confirmed in vitro by anchorage-independent growth, increased cell proliferation, and expression of CDKN2A, cyclin A2 and p53 alongside decreased phosphorylation of Rb. Moreover, Tag-transformed CD140a- and CD140a-CD49fâ€‰+â€‰pMECs developed site-specific tumors of differing histopathologies in vivo.ConclusionsHerein we establish a model for the transduction and oncogenic transformation of pMEC. This is the first report describing a porcine model of mammary epithelial cell tumorigenesis that can be applied to the study of human breast cancers."

"ROSSOW, Heidi A",Computer modeling of obesity links theoretical energetic measures with experimental measures of fuel use for lean and obese men.,"The goal of this research was to use a computational model of human metabolism to predict energy metabolism for lean and obese men. The model is composed of 6 state variables representing amino acids, muscle protein, visceral protein, glucose, triglycerides, and fatty acids (FAs). Differential equations represent carbohydrate, amino acid, and FA uptake and output by tissues based on ATP creation and use for both lean and obese men. Model parameterization is based on data from previous studies. Results from sensitivity analyses indicate that model predictions of resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) are dependent on FA and glucose oxidation rates with the highest sensitivity coefficients (0.6, 0.8 and 0.43, 0.15, respectively, for lean and obese models). Metabolizable energy (ME) is influenced by ingested energy intake with a sensitivity coefficient of 0.98, and a phosphate-to-oxygen ratio by FA oxidation rate and amino acid oxidation rate (0.32, 0.24 and 0.55, 0.65 for lean and obese models, respectively). Simulations of previously published studies showed that the model is able to predict ME ranging from 6.6 to 9.3 with 0% differences between published and model values, and RQ ranging from 0.79 to 0.86 with 1% differences between published and model values. REEs >7 MJ/d are predicted with 6% differences between published and model values. Glucose oxidation increases by âˆ¼0.59 mol/d, RQ increases by 0.03, REE increases by 2 MJ/d, and heat production increases by 1.8 MJ/d in the obese model compared with lean model simulations. Increased FA oxidation results in higher changes in RQ and lower relative changes in REE. These results suggest that because fat mass is directly related to REE and rate of FA oxidation, body fat content could be used as a predictor of RQ."

This study examines the effectiveness of three different types of transport observations for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of a three-dimensional site-specific groundwater flow and transport model: conservative tracer breakthrough curves (BTCs), first temporal moments of BTCs (m1), and tracer cumulative mass discharge (Md) through control planes combined with hydraulic head observations (h). High-resolution data obtained from a 410-day controlled field experiment at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California (USA), have been used. In this experiment, bromide was injected to create two adjacent plumes monitored at six different transects (perpendicular to groundwater flow) with a total of 162 monitoring wells. A total of 133 different observations of transient hydraulic head, 1,158 of BTC concentration, 23 of first moment, and 36 of mass discharge were used for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of nine flow and transport parameters. The importance of each group of transport observations in estimating these parameters was evaluated using sensitivity analysis, and five out of nine parameters were calibrated against these data. Results showed the advantages of using temporal moment of conservative tracer BTCs and mass discharge as observations for inverse modeling."

To improve control efficiency and cost-effectiveness, some advocate eliminating or treating only highly productive containers. The population-level outcome of this strategy, however, will depend on details of Ae. aegypti oviposition behavior.Methodology/principal findingsWe simultaneously monitored female oviposition and juvenile development in 80 experimental containers located across 20 houses in Iquitos, Peru, to test the hypothesis that Ae. aegypti oviposit preferentially in sites with the greatest potential for maximizing offspring fitness. Females consistently laid more eggs in large vs. small containers (Î²â€Š=â€Š9.18, p<0.001), and in unmanaged vs. manually filled containers (Î²â€Š=â€Š5.33, p<0.001). Using microsatellites to track the development of immature Ae. aegypti, we found a negative correlation between oviposition preference and pupation probability (Î²â€Š=â€Š-3.37, p<0.001). Body size of emerging adults was also negatively associated with the preferred oviposition site characteristics of large size (females: Î²â€Š=â€Š-0.19, p<0.001; males: Î²â€Š=â€Š-0.11, pâ€Š=â€Š0.002) and non-management (females: Î²â€Š=â€Š-0.17, p<0.001; males: Î²â€Š=â€Š-0.11, p<0.001). Inside a semi-field enclosure, we simulated a container elimination campaign targeting the most productive oviposition sites. Compared to the two post-intervention trials, egg batches were more clumped during the first pre-intervention trial (Î²â€Š=â€Š-0.17, P<0.001), but not the second (Î²â€Š=â€Š0.01, pâ€Š=â€Š0.900). Overall, when preferred containers were unavailable, the probability that any given container received eggs increased (Î²â€Š=â€Š1.36, p<0.001).Conclusions/significanceAe. aegypti oviposition site choice can contribute to population regulation by limiting the production and size of adults. Targeted larval control strategies may unintentionally lead to dispersion of eggs among suitable, but previously unoccupied or under-utilized containers. We recommend integrating targeted larval control measures with other strategies that leverage selective oviposition behavior, such as luring ovipositing females to gravid traps or egg sinks."
"MORRISON, Amy C","Strengths and Weaknesses of Global Positioning System (GPS) Data-Loggers and Semi-structured Interviews for Capturing Fine-scale Human Mobility: Findings from Iquitos, Peru","Quantifying human mobility has significant consequences for studying physical activity, exposure to pathogens, and generating more realistic infectious disease models. Location-aware technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled devices are used increasingly as a gold standard for mobility research. The main goal of this observational study was to compare and contrast the information obtained through GPS and semi-structured interviews (SSI) to assess issues affecting data quality and, ultimately, our ability to measure fine-scale human mobility. A total of 160 individuals, ages 7 to 74, from Iquitos, Peru, were tracked using GPS data-loggers for 14 days and later interviewed using the SSI about places they visited while tracked. A total of 2,047 and 886 places were reported in the SSI and identified by GPS, respectively. Differences in the concordance between methods occurred by location type, distance threshold (within a given radius to be considered a match) selected, GPS data collection frequency (i.e., 30, 90 or 150 seconds) and number of GPS points near the SSI place considered to define a match. Both methods had perfect concordance identifying each participant's house, followed by 80-100% concordance for identifying schools and lodgings, and 50-80% concordance for residences and commercial and religious locations. As the distance threshold selected increased, the concordance between SSI and raw GPS data increased (beyond 20 meters most locations reached their maximum concordance). Processing raw GPS data using a signal-clustering algorithm decreased overall concordance to 14.3%. The most common causes of discordance as described by a sub-sample (n=101) with whom we followed-up were GPS units being accidentally off (30%), forgetting or purposely not taking the units when leaving home (24.8%), possible barriers to the signal (4.7%) and leaving units home to recharge (4.6%). We provide a quantitative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of both methods for capturing fine-scale human mobility."

"LI, Jennifer",Interfacial Phenomena and the Ocular Surface,"Ocular surface disorders, such as dry eye disease, ocular rosacea, and allergic conjunctivitis, are a heterogeneous group of diseases that require an interdisciplinary approach to establish underlying causes and develop effective therapeutic strategies. These diverse disorders share a common thread in that they involve direct changes in ocular surface chemistry as well as the rheological properties of the tear film and topographical attributes of the cellular elements of the ocular surface. Knowledge of these properties is crucial to understand the formation and stability of the preocular tear film. The study of interfacial phenomena of the ocular surface flourished during the 1970s and 1980s, but after a series of lively debates in the literature concerning distinctions between the epithelial and the glandular origin of ocular surface disorders during the 1990s, research into this important topic has declined. In the meantime, new tools and techniques for the characterization and functionalization of biological surfaces have been developed. This review summarizes the available literature regarding the physicochemical attributes of the ocular surface, analyzes the role of interfacial phenomena in the pathobiology of ocular surface disease, identifies critical knowledge gaps concerning interfacial phenomena of the ocular surface, and discusses the opportunities for the exploitation of these phenomena to develop improved therapeutics for the treatment of ocular surface disorders."

Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH; encoded by Ephx2) deficiency and pharmacological inhibition have beneficial effects in inflammatory diseases. Ephx2 whole-body deficiency mitigates experimental AP in mice, but the suitability of sEH pharmacological inhibition for treating AP remains to be determined. We investigated the effects of sEH pharmacological inhibition on cerulein- and arginine-induced AP using the selective sEH inhibitor 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU), which was administered before and after induction of pancreatitis. Serum amylase and lipase levels were lower in TPPU-treated mice compared with controls. In addition, circulating levels and pancreatic mRNA of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin Il-1Î², and Il-6 were reduced in TPPU-treated mice. Moreover, sEH pharmacological inhibition before and after induction of pancreatitis was associated with decreased cerulein- and arginine-induced nuclear factor-ÎºB inflammatory response, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and cell death. sEH pharmacological inhibition before and after induction of pancreatitis mitigated cerulein- and arginine-induced AP. This work suggests that sEH pharmacological inhibition may be of therapeutic value in acute pancreatitis."

The samples were collected on the same day in the morning from 100 consumers (50 females, 50 males) and 100 farmers (50 females, 50 males) in the Fang district, Chiang Mai province, northern Thailand. The ELISA was very sensitive having an IC50 value of 26.7 and 15.3 ng/mL, a limit of quantitation of 5 and 2.5 ng/mL and a limit of detection of 1.08 and 1.94 ng/mL for plasma and urine, respectively. These methods had low (< 5%) intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation. The extraction technique satisfactorily eliminated the matrix effect from samples before ELISA analysis, yielding good recoveries (85.9-99.4% and 87.3-98.0%, respectively). For the volunteer study, the detection rate for plasma 3-PBA was 24% in consumers and 42% in farmers, but the median and range values were similar (median 5.87 ng/mL, range 5.16-8.44 ng/mL in consumers and 6.27 ng/mL, range 4.29-9.57 ng/mL in farmers). The rate of detection in the urine was similar (76% and 69%, in consumers and in farmers), yet the median concentration was significantly higher in farmers (8.86 Î¼g/g creatinine in consumers vs 16.1 Î¼g/g creatinine in farmers) and the range also much wider in farmers (1.62-80.5 Î¼g/g creatinine in consumers and 0.80-256.2 Î¼g/g creatinine in farmers). There was no correlation between plasma 3-PBA and urinary 3-PBA concentrations in the study presumably because plasma 3-PBA is a measure of cumulative exposures while urinary 3-PBA reflects acute exposures. In addition, metabolism and excretion of pyrethroids varies by individual. Nevertheless, this study demonstrated that these volunteers were exposed to pyrethroids. To our knowledge, this is the first report that compared plasma 3-PBA and urinary 3-PBA in a large group of volunteers. The ELISA method provided higher sample throughput with lower cost as compared to the instrumental analysis."

To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of acute (2 days) and chronic (14 days) sEH inhibition on blood pressure (BP) in transgenic rats with inducible AngII-dependent hypertension. AngII-dependent malignant hypertension was induced by 10 days' dietary administration of indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a natural xenobiotic that activates the mouse renin gene in Cyp1a1-Ren-2 transgenic rats. BP was monitored by radiotelemetry. Acute and chronic sEH inhibition was achieved using cis-4-(4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)cyclohexyloxy) benzoic acid, given at doses of 0.3, 3, 13, 26, 60 and 130 mg/L in drinking water. At the end of experiments, renal concentrations of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, their inactive metabolites dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids and AngII were measured. Acute BP-lowering effects of sEH inhibition in I3C-induced rats was associated with a marked increase in renal epoxyeicosatrienoic acids to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids ratio and acute natriuresis. Chronic treatment with cis-4-(4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)cyclohexyloxy) benzoic acid in I3C-induced rats elicited dose-dependent persistent BP lowering associated with a significant reduction of plasma and kidney AngII levels. Our findings show that the acute BP-lowering effect of sEH inhibition in I3C-induced Cyp1a1-Ren-2 transgenic rats is mediated by a substantial increase in intrarenal epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and their natriuretic action without altering intrarenal renin-angiotensin system activity. Long-term antihypertensive action of cis-4-(4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)cyclohexyloxy) benzoic acid in I3C-induced Cyp1a1-Ren-2 transgenic rats is mediated mostly by suppression of intrarenal AngII concentration."

The disease is characterized by distinct necrotic spots on leaves, stems and petioles that eventually expand and cause a dieback of apical tissues. Samples from symptomatic plants tested negative for infection by tomato spotted wilt virus, tobacco streak virus, tobacco etch virus and other known tomato-infecting viruses. A virus-like agent was sap-transmitted from diseased tissue to Nicotiana benthamiana and, when graft-transmitted to tomato, this agent induced chocolate spot symptoms. This virus-like agent also was sap-transmitted to Datura stramonium and Nicotiana glutinosa, but not to a range of non-solanaceous indicator plants. Icosahedral virions ~28â€“30&nbsp;nm in diameter were purified from symptomatic N. benthamiana plants. When rub-inoculated onto leaves of N. benthamiana plants, these virions induced symptoms indistinguishable from those in N. benthamiana plants infected with the sap-transmissible virus associated with chocolate spot disease. Tomatoes inoculated with sap or grafted with shoots from N. benthamiana plants infected with purified virions developed typical chocolate spot symptoms, consistent with this virus being the causal agent of the disease. Analysis of nucleic acids associated with purified virions of the chocolate-spot-associated virus, revealed a genome composed of two single-stranded RNAs of ~7.5 and ~5.1&nbsp;kb. Sequence analysis of these RNAs revealed a genome organization similar to recently described torradoviruses, a new group of picorna-like viruses causing necrosis-associated diseases of tomatoes in Europe [tomato torrado virus (ToTV)] and Mexico [tomato apex necrosis virus (ToANV) and tomato marchitez virus (ToMarV)]. Thus, the ~7.5&nbsp;kb and ~5.1&nbsp;kb RNAs of the chocolate-spot-associated virus corresponded to the torradovirus RNA1 and RNA2, respectively; however, sequence comparisons revealed 64â€“83% identities with RNA1 and RNA2 sequences of ToTV, ToANV and ToMarV. Together, these results indicate that the chocolate-spot-associated virus is a member of a distinct torradovirus species and, thus, another member of the recently established genus Torradovirus in the family Secoviridae. The name tomato chocolate spot virus is proposed."

There is a need to find high value uses for such material. The objective of this study was to characterize the mechanical properties and water resistance of medium density particleboard made from saline JTW. A two- factor factorial experiment design was used to determine the effects of NaOH treatment and type of adnesives, including polymeric methane diphenyl diisocyanate (PMDI) and Urea formaldehyde (UF) resin, on mechanical properties and water resistance of finished particleboards. To study the binding capability of the particles, NaOH treatment was used to wash the particles for removing the wax and inorganic silica on the surface of JTW. This study also characterized the effects of different particleboard densities (0.71, 0.72, 0.73, 0.74, and 0.75 g/cm 3) and initial moisture contents (MC) of the particles (2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10%) on mechanical properties and water resistance of particleboards. Water resistance and mechanical properties of finished particleboard were measured. The water resistance properties included water absorption and thickness swell and mechanical properties included modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), internal bond strength (IB), and tensile strength (TS). The particleboards made with PMDI showed superior mechanical strength and water resistance compared with those made with UF regardless of the use of NaOH treatment. The NaOH treatment deteriorated the mechanical strength and water resistance capability of the particleboards, but did not affect the contact angles between the adhesives and JTW. When the density of the particleboards increased, both mechanical strength and the water resistance were improved. Among the five MC tested, from the particles of 8% initial MC resulted in the best mechanical properties and water resistance of the particleboard."

As part of adaptive management, it is necessary to determine the practicability of design features and construction methods before widespread adoption. In this study, we compared design versus as-built topography for five salmonid spawning habitat rehabilitation projects at riffle-pool geomorphic units on the lower Mokelumne River, California, USA. These were built instream using rubber tire front loaders. Digital elevation models (DEMs) of each site were produced for pre-project, design and as-built conditions. DEM differencing was used to compare the as-built surface against corresponding design surfaces at each site to identify deviations. Causes of each identified deviation were assessed based on subjective observations by a team during construction. Across the projects, 70% of as-built topography was within Â± 0.15m of design specifications. Of the 30% deviating from the design, 41% was overfilled and 59% underfilled. The 30% of rehabilitated channel area that deviated from designs did not affect predicted areas of high-quality spawning habitat. On-site factors that hindered accurate construction of designs included front loader fording depth, poor operator elevation estimation, operator spatial disorientation and wood obstructions. In addition, funding and project management uncertainties caused gravel supply deficits and gravel bulk density estimation errors. It is concluded that constructing broad (>0.5-m relief) features of process-based salmonid spawning habitat rehabilitation projects by gravel augmentation is practicable. However, uncertainties attributed to human error and available methods inhibit detailed (<0.5-m relief) rehabilitation. Despite uncertainties, limitations and errors, following the recommendations reported in this study would improve the as-built adherence to design specifications of future projects.

Increased expression of arginase I and NOS2 occurs in murine models of allergic asthma and in biopsies of asthmatic airways. Although clinical trials involving the inhibition of NO-producing enzymes have shown mixed results, small molecule arginase inhibitors have shown potential as a therapeutic intervention in animal and cell culture models. Their transition to clinical trials is hampered by concerns regarding their safety and potential toxicity. In this review, we discuss the paradigm of arginase and NOS competition for their substrate L-arginine in the asthmatic airway. We address the functional role of L-arginine in inflammation and the potential role of arginase inhibitors as therapeutics."

There is a need to quantify the level of landscape fragmentation in an ecologically meaningful way for inclusion in planning and decision-making. Effective mesh size (meff) is an ecologically relevant metric that quantifies landscape fragmentation based on the probability that two randomly chosen points in a region are located in the same non-fragmented patch. We investigated variation in meff measured by transportation districts, municipal counties, and six spatial levels of watersheds within the state of California. Four fragmentation geometries were developed by overlaying highways, roads, urbanized areas, agricultural areas, and natural fragmenting features. Two meff calculation methods were compared: one where planning unit boundaries fragment the landscape (CUT), the other allowing for cross-boundary connections (CBC). The CUT procedure always produced lower meff values than CBC, with greater differences occurring in smaller planning units, confirming the bias introduced using boundaries with landscape metrics. Calculated meff values varied from 0 to 20 885 km2 across 6994 units in California. Roads contributed the most to fragmentation, while agriculture contributed little, as California's agricultural areas are already heavily fragmented by roads. This paper provides a systematic, quantitative, and intuitive method for transportation, land use and environmental planners to analyze cumulative impacts of multiple fragmenting features across a range of spatial scales within a variety of planning units. This approach could be used for analyzing the impact of future land development scenarios, and integrated into regional planning processes. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However, the existing attacks suffer from several limitations: (i) the attack process is time consuming, (ii) the tests are performed under nearly identical network conditions while the practical fingerprints are normally variable in terms of the end-to-end network connections, and (iii) the total possible video streams are limited to a small pre-known set while the performance against possibly larger databases remains unclear. In this paper, we overcome the above limitations by introducing a traffic analysis scheme that is both robust and efficient for variable bit rate (VBR) video streaming. To construct unique and robust video signatures with different compactness, we apply a (wavelet-based) analysis to extract the long and short range dependencies within the video traffic. Statistical significance testing is utilized to construct an efficient matching algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the identification algorithm using a large video database populated with a variety of movies and TV shows. Our experimental results show that, even under different real network conditions, our attacks can achieve high detection rates and low false alarm rates using video clips of only a few minutes.

Based on 242 samples from six commodities (basil, yardlong beans, bitter squash, okra, squash stems and leaves, cilantro), 100% of samples had detectable FCs and 20% had detectable E. coli. The mean concentrations were 0.67 log CFU/g and 1.26 log CFU per bundle for E. coli and 4.00 log CFU/g and 6.26 log CFU per bundle for FCs. Vegetables irrigated with ground versus surface water contained lower concentrations of FCs, but this difference was not observed for E. coli. Yardlong beans, bitter squash, and okra had lower levels of FCs compared with basil, cilantro, and squash stems and leaves. Sixteen (6.6%) samples had detectable levels of Salmonella serovars (Newport, Enteritidis, Agona, and Worthington), with the majority of positives found in cilantro and squash stems and leaves. There was a twofold higher probability of Salmonella contamination in samples from growers or vendors who stated that they used organic farming practices compared with samples from those using conventional farming practices. Lastly, the concentrations of FC and E. coli bacteria were significantly associated with Salmonella contamination: for each additional 100 CFU/g or bundle, the probability of Salmonella contamination increased by âˆ¼15 and âˆ¼30%, respectively. None of the samples had detectable E. coli O157:H7."

A list was created of 121 glycosylation-related genes involved in oligosaccharide metabolism pathways in bovine by analyzing the oligosaccharide profiles and performing an extensive literature search. No significant differences were observed in either oligosaccharide profiles or expressions of glycosylation-related genes between Holstein and Jersey cows. The highest concentrations of free oligosaccharides were observed in the colostrum samples and a sharp decrease was observed in the concentration of free oligosaccharides on day 15, followed by progressive decrease on days 90 and 250. Ninety-two glycosylation-related genes were expressed in milk somatic cells. Most of these genes exhibited higher expression in day 250 samples indicating increases in net glycosylation-related metabolism in spite of decreases in free milk oligosaccharides in late lactation milk. Even though fucosylated free oligosaccharides were not identified, gene expression indicated the likely presence of fucosylated oligosaccharides in bovine milk. Fucosidase genes were expressed in milk and a possible explanation for not detecting fucosylated free oligosaccharides is the degradation of large fucosylated free oligosaccharides by the fucosidases. Detailed characterization of enzymes encoded by the 92 glycosylation-related genes identified in this study will provide the basic knowledge for metabolic network analysis of oligosaccharides in mammalian milk. These candidate genes will guide the design of a targeted breeding strategy to optimize the content of beneficial oligosaccharides in bovine milk."

"HARGADON, Andrew B",Enhancing Creativity Through â€œMindlessâ€ Work: A Framework of Workday Design,"We propose that organizations use a new framework of workday design to enhance the creativity of today's chronically overworked professionals. Although insights from creativity research have been integrated into models of work design to increase the stimulants of creativity (e.g., intrinsic motivation), this has not led to work design models that have effectively reduced the obstacles to creativity (e.g., workload pressures). As a consequence, creative output among professionals in high-workload contexts remains disappointing. In response, we offer a framework of work design that focuses on the design of entire workdays rather than the typical focus on designing either specific tasks or very broad job descriptions (e.g., as the job characteristics model in Hackman et al. 1975). Furthermore, we introduce the concept of ""mindless"" work (i.e., work that is low in both cognitive difficulty and performance pressures) as an integral part of this framework. We suggest that to enhance creativity among chronically overworked professionals, workdays should be designed to alternate between bouts of cognitively challenging and high-pressure work (as suggested in the original model by Hackman et al. 1975), and bouts of mindless work (as defined in this paper). We discuss the implications of our framework for theories of work design and creativity. Â© 2006 INFORMS."

"HAVEL, Peter J",Effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha on leptin secretion and gene expression: relationship to changes of glucose metabolism in isolated rat adipocytes,"ObjectiveOur objective was to determine the effects of prolonged exposure to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on leptin secretion from and leptin (OB) gene expression in isolated adipocytes. Because glucose uptake and the metabolism of glucose beyond lactate are important determinants of leptin production in adipocytes, we examined the effects of TNF-alpha on glucose uptake and lactate production and their relationship to leptin secretion.Design and methodsIsolated rat adipocytes were anchored in a defined matrix of basement membrane components and cultured with media containing 5 mM glucose, 0.16 nM insulin and several concentrations of TNF-alpha. Leptin secretion, steady-state levels of leptin mRNA levels, glucose uptake, and lactate production were assessed over 96 h.ResultsTNF-alpha at concentrations of 0.024, 0.24, 2.4 and 24 ng/ml did not affect leptin secretion over 24 h. TNF-alpha at concentrations of 0.24 to 24 ng/ml significantly inhibited leptin secretion over 96 h by 19-60%. TNF-alpha at concentrations of 0.024 to 24 ng/ml significantly decreased steady-state levels of leptin mRNA after 96 h by 32-95%. In addition, TNF-alpha at concentrations of 2.4 and 24 ng/ml significantly increased glucose uptake and lactate production over 96 h by 30-57%. TNF-alpha at a concentration of 0.024 ng/ml did not affect leptin secretion, glucose uptake or lactate production. Overall, for the TNF-alpha concentrations tested, leptin secretion was inversely related to the percent of glucose carbon released as lactate; however, TNF-alpha did not induce a proportional increase of lactate production from glucose.ConclusionShort-term (24 h) exposure of isolated adipocytes to TNF-alpha does not affect leptin secretion. Prolonged exposure to TNF-alpha produces a concentration-dependent inhibition of leptin secretion and gene expression. This suggests that the acute effect of TNF-alpha to increase circulating leptin levels in vivo may be indirect. TNF-alpha at higher concentrations increases glucose uptake, but does not increase the conversion of glucose to lactate. Therefore, TNF-alpha appears to induce a dissociation between adipocyte glucose metabolism and leptin production."

Although there are literature reports of adverse cardiac events of high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, the mechanism of these changes is unrecognized. The authors report a case of markedly prolonged QT and resultant ventricular tachycardia characteristic of torsade de pointes in a patient treated with high-dose intravenous steroids and ketoconazole. Based on animal studies, these changes are likely due to a decrease in outward potassium currents. Awareness of the arrhythmogenic effects of highdose intravenous steroids should prompt electrocardiographic monitoring of these patients. Â© 2002 CVRR, Inc."

This paper presents a hierarchical and decentralized approach for integrated damage assessment and trajectory re-planning in aircraft with uncertainties in navigational decision-making. Aircraft navigation can be safely accomplished by properly addressing the following: decision-making, obstacle perception, aircraft state estimation, and aircraft control. When inflight failures or damage occur resulting in an emergency, rapid and precise decision-making under imprecise information is required in order to regain and maintain control of the aircraft. In order to fly the pre-planned aircraft trajectory and complete safe landing, the uncertainties in system dynamics of the damaged aircraft need to be estimated and incorporated at the level of motion replanning. The damaged aircraft is simulated via a simplified kinematic model. The different sources and perspectives of uncertainties in the damage assessment process and post-failure trajectory re-planning are presented. The decision-making process is developed via the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The objective of the trajectory replanning is to arrive at a target position while maximizing the safety of the aircraft given uncertain conditions. Simulations are presented for an emergency motion planning and landing that takes into account aircraft dynamics, path complexity, distance to landing site, runway characteristics, and subjective human decision."
"DEERE, Jesse D",Variation of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 Reverse Transcriptase within the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Genome of RT-SHIV,"RT-SHIV is a chimera of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) containing the reverse transcriptase (RT)-encoding region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) within the backbone of SIVmac239. It has been used in a non-human primate model for studies of non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTI) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We and others have identified several mutations that arise in the ""foreign"" HIV-1 RT of RT-SHIV during in vivo replication. In this study we catalogued amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 RT and in regions of the SIV backbone with which RT interacts that emerged 30 weeks post-infection from seven RT-SHIV-infected rhesus macaques. The virus set points varied from relatively high virus load, moderate virus load, to undetectable virus load. The G196R substitution in RT was detected from 6 of 7 animals at week 4 post-infection and remained in virus from 4 of 6 animals at week 30. Virus from four high virus load animals showed several common mutations within RT, including L74V or V75L, G196R, L214F, and K275R. The foreign RT from high virus load isolates exhibited as much variation as that of the highly variable envelope surface glycoprotein, and 10-fold higher than that of the native RT of SIVmac239. Isolates from moderate virus load animals showed much less variation in the foreign RT than the high virus load isolates. No variation was found in SIVmac239 genes known to interact with RT. Our results demonstrate substantial adaptation of the foreign HIV-1 RT in RT-SHIV-infected macaques, which most likely reflects selective pressure upon the foreign RT to attain optimal activity within the context of the chimeric RT-SHIV and the rhesus macaque host."
"SARIGUL-KLIJN, Nesrin",Aggregating imprecise information in distressed aircraft path planning,"This paper investigates the uncertainty information management in emergency path planning via probability and imprecise probability methods. When in-flight failures or damage occur resulting in a distress condition, rapid and precise decision-making under imprecise information is required in order to regain and maintain control of the aircraft. In order to fly the pre-planned aircraft trajectory and complete safe landing, the uncertainties in system dynamics of the damaged aircraft need to be estimated and incorporated at the level of motion re-planning. The damaged aircraft is simulated via a simplified kinematic model. The different sources and perspectives of uncertainties in the damage assessment process and post-distress trajectory re-planning are presented. The objective of the trajectory re-planning is to arrive at a target position while maximizing the safety of the aircraft given uncertain conditions. Comparative analysis between Bayesian and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is presented for analyzing imprecise information. Simulations that take into account aircraft dynamics, path complexity, distance to landing site, runway characteristics, and subjective human decision are presented for motion planning and landing of an aircraft following a hypothetical distress event."
"SARIGUL-KLIJN, Nesrin",Development and simulation of an analytic skip earth re-entry guidance algorithm,"An Analytical Skip Entry Guidance (ASEG) algorithm is developed and simulated for a low L/D spacecraft. Formulation is based on an adaptation of the analytical theory developed for the Shuttle Entry Guidance (SEG). The validation study showed that, the SEG assumption of the flight path angle to be zero is not applicable. More accurate reference altitude rate profile and range prediction were developed when the flight path angle was assumed to be nonzero. In addition, the scale height formulation was modified for the first segment of the 1st entry phase in order to complete the development of a valid reference altitude rate profile. Given these modifications, a baseline ASEG algorithm was integrated with the Simulation of Rocket Trajectories Program and full simulations were completed. The baseline simulation revealed that the ASEG reference L/D developed for segment 1, did not provide a correct bank command profile to achieve a skip trajectory. Thus, a constant L/D was implemented for the first segment of the 1st entry phase and the baseline simulation was established, range targeting technique was implemented in the ASEG algorithm and flight simulations were completed using SORT. The ASEG algorithm and range targeting are applied after entry interface when the drag acceleration is approximately 0.2g's and terminates targeting as the vehicle approaches 0.2g's towards exit. The results show that the ranging technique commanded the vehicle to fly a total range that was within 3.2% of the nominal projected total range. Copyright Â© 2008 by the authors."

"FULLER, Patrick M",Toll Mediated Infection Response Is Altered by Gravity and Spaceflight in Drosophila,"Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response."

"HANSON, Bradley",Herbicide-resistant weeds challenge some signature cropping systems,"Invasive and endemic weeds pose recurring challenges for California land managers. The evolution of herbicide resistance in several species has imposed new challenges in some cropping systems, and these issues are being addressed by UC Cooperative Extension farm advisors, specialists and faculty. There are currently 24 unique herbicide-resistant weed biotypes in the state, dominated by grasses and sedges in flooded rice systems and, more recently, glyphosate-resistant broadleaf and grass weeds in tree and vine systems, roadsides and glyphosate-tolerant field crops. Weed scientists address these complex issues using approaches ranging from basic physiology and genetics research to applied research and extension efforts in grower fields throughout the state. Although solutions to herbicide resistance are not simple and are affected by many biological, economic, regulatory and social factors, California stakeholders need information, training and solutions to address new weed management problems as they arise. Coordinated efforts conducted under the Endemic and Invasive Pests and Disease Strategic Initiative directly address weed management challenges in California's agricultural industries."

"BANNASCH, Danika",SERPINB11 Frameshift Variant Associated with Novel Hoof Specific Phenotype in Connemara Ponies,"Horses belong to the order Perissodactyla and bear the majority of their weight on their third toe; therefore, tremendous force is applied to each hoof. An inherited disease characterized by a phenotype restricted to the dorsal hoof wall was identified in the Connemara pony. Hoof wall separation disease (HWSD) manifests clinically as separation of the dorsal hoof wall along the weight-bearing surface of the hoof during the first year of life. Parents of affected ponies appeared clinically normal, suggesting an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. A case-control allelic genome wide association analysis was performed (ncases = 15, ncontrols = 24). Population stratification (Î» = 1.48) was successfully improved by removing outliers (ncontrols = 7) identified on a multidimensional scaling plot. A genome-wide significant association was detected on chromosome 8 (praw = 1.37x10-10, pgenome = 1.92x10-5). A homozygous region identified in affected ponies spanned from 79,936,024-81,676,900 bp and contained a family of 13 annotated SERPINB genes. Whole genome next-generation sequencing at 6x coverage of two cases and two controls revealed 9,758 SNVs and 1,230 indels within the ~1.7-Mb haplotype, of which 17 and 5, respectively, segregated with the disease and were located within or adjacent to genes. Additional genotyping of these 22 putative functional variants in 369 Connemara ponies (ncases = 23, ncontrols = 346) and 169 horses of other breeds revealed segregation of three putative variants adjacent or within four SERPIN genes. Two of the variants were non-coding and one was an insertion within SERPINB11 that introduced a frameshift resulting in a premature stop codon. Evaluation of mRNA levels at the proximal hoof capsule (ncases = 4, ncontrols = 4) revealed that SERPINB11 expression was significantly reduced in affected ponies (p<0.001). Carrier frequency was estimated at 14.8%. This study describes the first genetic variant associated with a hoof wall specific phenotype and suggests a role of SERPINB11 in maintaining hoof wall structure."

The study area at the El Cedral is located along the western margin of the Devils River grainstone belt flanking the muddy, intrashelf Maverick Basin. Four relatively complete clinothems and portions of two adjacent clinothems are recognized in the Las Pilas Formation in the study area. The Las Pilas clinothems exhibit complex sigmoid-oblique geometries and have dimensions of 40-60 m of vertical relief, depositional dip angles of foreset beds ranging from 8 to 15Â°, and dip-oriented lengths of 1-2 km. Internally, in foresets of clinothems, thick- to massively bedded, sigmoid- to oblique-shaped lenses exhibit overlapping, seaward-stepping patterns toward the southeast. The primary sediment fabrics of topset, foreset, and bottomset beds of the Las Pilas clinothems are grainstones and grain-rich packstones. Coated grains are the predominant grain type, with subordinate amounts of micritized mollusk fragments and intraclasts. Porosity is predominantly moldic, but primary interparticle porosity is common. These lime sands were winnowed, coated, and micritized along the high-energy topsets of clinoforms before being exported seaward toward the breakpoint, where they cascaded onto the steep frontal slopes as sporadic grain flows or mass flows. The master bounding surfaces that define the clinothems likely represent episodes of nondeposition and abandonment of the surface, perhaps occurring during shifts in the locus of deposition laterally along the shoal margin. The architecture and composition of the Las Pilas clinoforms provide observable data for comparison with analogous subsurface reservoirs in the Aptian Shuaiba Formation (Bu Hasa field) and Cenomanian Mishrif Formation (e.g., Umm Adalkh field) of the Arabian Gulf."

"HAVEL, Peter J",Preâ€eclampsia disrupts the normal relationship between serum leptin concentrations and adiposity in pregnant women,"The adipocyte hormone, leptin, is secreted in proportion to adipose mass and is implicated in the regulation of energy balance via its central actions on food intake and sympathetic nervous system activity. The placenta was also shown recently to be a possible source of leptin in pregnant women, raising the possibility that the normal relationship between leptin and adiposity may be altered in pre-eclampsia. We therefore sought to assess the extent to which maternal second trimester serum leptin concentrations differed for women who would subsequently develop pre-eclampsia and those who would remain normotensive. This nested case-control study population comprised 38 women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuria (pre-eclampsia) and 192 normotensive women. Multiple least-squares regression procedures were used to assess the independent relationship between leptin concentrations and risk of pre-eclampsia. Serum leptin concentrations, measured by radioimmunoassay, were highly correlated with maternal pre-pregnancy and second trimester body mass index (r = 0.71 and r = 0.74 respectively; P < 0.001 for both) among normotensive women, and to a lesser extent among women who developed pre-eclampsia (r = 0.29 and r = 0.42; P = 0.09 and 0.02 respectively). Among women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of < or = 25 kg/m2, pre-eclampsia cases compared with controls had higher mean second trimester leptin concentrations after adjustment for confounding factors. In contrast, pre-eclampsia cases had lower mean leptin concentrations than controls for those women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index above 25 kg/m2. Other factors in addition to the level of adiposity may therefore influence serum leptin concentrations in pre-eclamptic pregnant women. Our results suggest the possibility that leptin, like several other placentally derived substances (e.g. steroid hormones, eicosanoids and cytokines), may be involved in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Further work is needed to confirm our findings and to assess the metabolic importance and determinants of leptin concentrations in uncomplicated and pre-eclamptic pregnancies."
"PARIKH, Atul N",Analysis of Lipid Phase Behavior and Protein Conformational Changes in Nanolipoprotein Particles upon Entrapment in Solâ€“Gel-Derived Silica,"The entrapment of nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs) and liposomes in transparent, nanoporous silica gel derived from the precursor tetramethylorthosilicate was investigated. NLPs are discoidal patches of lipid bilayer that are belted by amphiphilic scaffold proteins and have an average thickness of 5 nm. The NLPs in this work had a diameter of roughly 15 nm and utilized membrane scaffold protein (MSP), a genetically altered variant of apolipoprotein A-I. Liposomes have previously been examined inside of silica sol-gels and have been shown to exhibit instability. This is attributed to their size (âˆ¼150 nm) and altered structure and constrained lipid dynamics upon entrapment within the nanometer-scale pores (5-50 nm) of the silica gel. By contrast, the dimensional match of NLPs with the intrinsic pore sizes of silica gel opens the possibility for their entrapment without disruption. Here we demonstrate that NLPs are more compatible with the nanometer-scale size of the porous environment by analysis of lipid phase behavior via fluorescence anisotropy and analysis of scaffold protein secondary structure via circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our results showed that the lipid phase behavior of NLPs entrapped inside of silica gel display closer resemblance to its solution behavior, more so than liposomes, and that the MSP in the NLPs maintain the high degree of Î±-helix secondary structure associated with functional protein-lipid interactions after entrapment. We also examined the effects of residual methanol on lipid phase behavior and the size of NLPs and found that it exerts different influences in solution and in silica gel; unlike in free solution, silica entrapment may be inhibiting NLP size increase and/or aggregation. These findings set precedence for a bioinorganic hybrid nanomaterial that could incorporate functional integral membrane proteins."

The clinical involvement has been well characterized for fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). The behavior/psychiatric and other neurological manifestations remain to be specified as well as the molecular mechanisms that will explain the phenotypic variability observed in individuals with the FMR1 premutation.MethodsHere we describe a small pilot study of copy number variants (CNVs) in 56 participants with a premutation ranging from 55 to 192 repeats. The participants were divided into four different clinical groups for the analysis: those with behavioral problems but no autism spectrum disorder (ASD); those with ASD but without neurological problems; those with ASD and neurological problems including seizures; and those with neurological problems without ASD.ResultsWe found 12 rare CNVs (eight duplications and four deletions) in 11 cases (19.6%) that were not found in approximately 8,000 controls. Three of them were at 10q26 and two at Xp22.3, with small areas of overlap. The CNVs were more commonly identified in individuals with neurological involvement and ASD.ConclusionsThe frequencies were not statistically significant across the groups. There were no significant differences in the psychometric and behavior scores among all groups. Further studies are necessary to determine the frequency of second genetic hits in individuals with the FMR1 premutation; however, these preliminary results suggest that genomic studies can be useful in understanding the molecular etiology of clinical involvement in premutation carriers with ASD and neurological involvement."

Using individual item scores from the Autism Diagnostic Inventory-Revised, we examined which current symptoms of autism differed in boys with FXS relative to same-aged boys diagnosed with nonsyndromic ASD. In addition, different subsamples of participants were matched on autism diagnostic status and severity of autism symptoms. Between-group comparisons revealed that boys with FXS showed significantly less impairment in Social Smiling than did age-, diagnostic-, and severity-matched boys with nonsyndromic ASD. Severity-matched boys with FXS showed more impairment in complex mannerisms than did boys with nonsyndromic ASD. Behavioral differences between FXS and nonsyndromic ASD may be of theoretical importance in understanding the causes and correlates of ASD in FXS and in developing and implementing appropriate treatments."

METHODS:A total of 119 breast lesions from 104 noncontrast dedicated breast computed tomography images of women were used in this study. Volumetric segmentation was done using a seed-based segmentation algorithm and then a triangulated surface was extracted from the resulting segmentation. Total, mean, and Gaussian curvatures were then computed. Normalized curvatures were used as classification features. In addition, traditional image features were also extracted and a forward feature selection scheme was used to select the optimal feature set. Logistic regression was used as a classifier and leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized to evaluate the classification performances of the features. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC, area under curve) was used as a figure of merit. RESULTS:Among curvature measures, the normalized total curvature (CT) showed the best classification performance (AUC of 0.74), while the others showed no classification power individually. Five traditional image features (two shape, two margin, and one texture descriptors) were selected via the feature selection scheme and its resulting classifier achieved an AUC of 0.83. Among those five features, the radial gradient index (RGI), which is a margin descriptor, showed the best classification performance (AUC of 0.73). A classifier combining RGI and CT yielded an AUC of 0.81, which showed similar performance (i.e., no statistically significant difference) to the classifier with the above five traditional image features. Additional comparisons in AUC values between classifiers using different combinations of traditional image features and CT were conducted. The results showed that CT was able to replace the other four image features for the classification task. CONCLUSIONS:The normalized curvature measure contains useful information in classifying breast tumors. Using this, one can reduce the number of features in a classifier, which may result in more robust classifiers for different datasets."

The system requirements and specifications for the device development are presented and discussed. In addition, the detailed architecture, hardware, software, and user interface design are included. Vehicular and personal GPS-ATD systems were developed to support comprehensive traveler behavior studies. The GPS-ATD provides an intuitive user interface to capture trip activity information (trip purpose, travel mode, etc.), with minimal user input and burden during travel surveys. Each survey participant interacts with their own personal GPS-ATD, and information is automatically coordinated between personal and vehicular GPS-ATD units via' ZigBee wireless. The system captures and logs data from the High-Sensitivity GPS (HSGPS) receiver, allowing subsequent identification of corridors, route lengths, and regional and inter-regional trips. The primary sensor is the HSGPS receiver. For the vehicular GPS-ATD, inertial sensing (MEMS gyro and accelerometers) is also provided to fill in the gaps during GPS outages and cold starts. To obtain vehicle sensor information, the GPS-ATD uses ZigBee wireless communications to the car computer On-Board Diagnostics connector (OBD-II). Following the design discussion, complete system testing and results are presented. The paper concludes with recommendations for future work related to the GPS-ATD and its use in the 2010 California Statewide Household Travel Survey."

The domestic dog has been suggested as a model to investigate normal variation in attention, hyperactivity, and impulsive behaviours impaired in Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). The human ADHD Rating Scale, modified for dogs and using owner-directed surveys, was applied in a European sample. We asked whether findings would be replicated utilizing an Internet survey in a novel sample, where unassisted survey completion, participant attitudes and breeds might affect previous findings.MethodsUsing a slightly modified version of the prior survey, we collected responses (n = 1030, 118 breeds representing 7 breed groups) primarily in the United States and Canada. This study was conducted using an Internet survey mechanism.ResultsReliability analyses confirmed two scales previously identified for dogs (inattention [IA], hyperactivity-impulsivity [HA-IM]). Models including age, training status, and breed group accounted for very little variance in subscales, with no effect of gender.ConclusionsThe factor invariance demonstrated in these findings confirms that owner report, using this modified human questionnaire, provides dog scores according to ""inattention"" and ""hyperactivity-impulsivity"" axes. Further characterization of naturally occurring variability of attention, activity, and impulsivity in domestic dogs may provide insight into genetic backgrounds underlying behaviours impaired in attention and associated disorders."

A widely cited example is the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV).  It was launched in 1993 by the Clinton Administration and three US automakers, with the goal of advancing the development of energy efficient vehicles.  It has come to be seen as a model, and in many ways it is: it is proceeding according to schedule; it increased the profile of advanced technology opportunities; and it led to better working relationship between the federal government and automakers.  It also indirectly led to technology advancement â€“ by inspiring more aggressive investments by European and Japanese automakers that, in turn, through a boomerang effect, inspired US automakers to do likewise.  It is a success in the sense that both sets of partners are pleased.  But has it served the public interest?  Has it lead to the best investment of government R&amp;D funds and has it accelerated the commercialization of socially beneficial technologies?

"PAGE, Marianne E",Family background and children's transitions to adulthood over time,"The transition to adulthood is almost by definition a process of breaking away from one's family of origin. Nevertheless, family background has an impact on the success of this transition. For example, Gary Sandefur, Jennifer Eggerling-Boeck, and Hyunjoon Park (2005) and David Ellwood and Thomas Kane (2000) show that parental education and family income are positively correlated with the probability that a young adult will pursue postsecondary education, and Tom Hertz (2005) estimates that a son born into a family whose income is in the top 10 percent of the income distribution is twenty-three times more likely to end up in the top 10 percent as an adult than a son born into the bottom 10 percent. Over the past thirty years, several social and economic changes may have altered the impact of parents on the success with which their children approach adulthood. In this chapter, we look at whether the importance of family background has changed over time. We compare various ""markers"" of adulthood for two groups who were coming of age in the mid-1970s and early 1990s. We look at whether early adult income levels, educational attainment, and the probability of starting one's own family differ by parental income and education, and we ask how these differences have changed over time. Knowing the extent to which family influences are changing is an important part of understanding why today's youth are taking longer to reach traditional markers of adulthood than previous generations. There may be important policy considerations as well. For example, if the association between parental income and the economic success of their children is becoming stronger over time, and if this association is due to the changing impact of income itself rather than the effects of other family characteristics correlated with income, then policies aimed at increasing the financial resources of poor families may also affect trends in outcomes for youths. We come to three conclusions. First, a successful transition to adulthood differs markedly across individuals who grew up in high- and lowincome families and with high- and low-educated parents.1 Second, there is little evidence that the influence of characteristics associated with parental income has changed over time. An exception is that those who grew up in high-income families seem to be delaying childbearing more than they did in the past. Third, the relationship between young adults' education and that of their parents appears to have become stronger over time. This is in marked contrast to the lack of a significant change between parental education and the next generation's income, and it is somewhat surprising given the large increases in the wage returns to schooling that took place over this period.

Moreover, there are increasing research interests focusing on utilizing distributed networked computers for parallel computing. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard was designed to support portability and platform independence of a developed parallel program. However, the procedure to start an MPI-based parallel computation among distributed computers lacks autonomicity and flexibility. This article presents an autonomic dynamic parallel computing framework that provides autonomicity and flexibility that are important and necessary to some parallel computing applications involving resource constrained and heterogeneous platforms. In this framework, an MPI parallel computing environment consisting of multiple computing entities is dynamically established through inter-agent communications using the IEEE Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) compliant Agent Communication Language (ACL) messages. For each computing entity in the MPI parallel computing environment, a load-balanced MPI program C source code along with the MPI environment configuration statements are dynamically composed as a mobile agent code. A mobile agent wrapping the mobile agent code is created and sent to the computing entity where the mobile agent code is retrieved and interpretively executed. An example of autonomic parallel matrix multiplication is given to demonstrate the self-configuration and self-optimization properties of the presented framework. Copyright Â© 2009 by ASME."

The effects of fructose, compared with glucose, ingestion on metabolic profiles in obese subjects has not been studied.ObjectiveThe objective of the study was to compare the effects of fructose- and glucose-sweetened beverages consumed with meals on hormones and metabolic substrates in obese subjects.Design and settingThe study had a within-subject design conducted in the clinical and translational research center.ParticipantsParticipants included 17 obese men (n = 9) and women (n = 8), with a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m(2).InterventionsSubjects were studied under two conditions involving ingestion of mixed nutrient meals with either glucose-sweetened beverages or fructose-sweetened beverages. The beverages provided 30% of total kilocalories. Blood samples were collected over 24 h.Main outcome measuresArea under the curve (24 h AUC) for glucose, lactate, insulin, leptin, ghrelin, uric acid, triglycerides (TGs), and free fatty acids was measured.ResultsCompared with glucose-sweetened beverages, fructose consumption was associated with lower AUCs for insulin (1052.6 +/- 135.1 vs. 549.2 +/- 79.7 muU/ml per 23 h, P < 0.001) and leptin (151.9 +/- 22.7 vs. 107.0 +/- 15.0 ng/ml per 24 h, P < 0.03) and increased AUC for TG (242.3 +/- 96.8 vs. 704.3 +/- 124.4 mg/dl per 24 h, P < 0.0001). Insulin-resistant subjects exhibited larger 24-h TG profiles (P < 0.03).ConclusionsIn obese subjects, consumption of fructose-sweetened beverages with meals was associated with less insulin secretion, blunted diurnal leptin profiles, and increased postprandial TG concentrations compared with glucose consumption. Increases of TGs were augmented in obese subjects with insulin resistance, suggesting that fructose consumption may exacerbate an already adverse metabolic profile present in many obese subjects."

"SYKES, Jane E",Antifungal Drug Susceptibility and Phylogenetic Diversity among Cryptococcus Isolates from Dogs and Cats in North America,"Molecular types of the Cryptococcus neoformans/Cryptococcus gattii species complex that infect dogs and cats differ regionally and with host species. Antifungal drug susceptibility can vary with molecular type, but the susceptibility of Cryptococcus isolates from dogs and cats is largely unknown. Cryptococcus isolates from 15 dogs and 27 cats were typed using URA5 restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP), PCR fingerprinting, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Susceptibility was determined using a microdilution assay (Sensititre YeastOne; Trek Diagnostic Systems). MICs were compared among groups. The 42 isolates studied comprised molecular types VGI (7%), VGIIa (7%), VGIIb (5%), VGIIc (5%), VGIII (38%), VGIV (2%), VNI (33%), and VNII (2%), as determined by URA5 RFLP. The VGIV isolate was more closely related to VGIII according to MLST. All VGIII isolates were from cats. All sequence types identified from veterinary isolates clustered with isolates from humans. VGIII isolates showed considerable genetic diversity compared with other Cryptococcus molecular types and could be divided into two major subgroups. Compared with C. neoformans MICs, C. gattii MICs were lower for flucytosine, and VGIII MICs were lower for flucytosine and itraconazole. For all drugs except itraconazole, C. gattii isolates exhibited a wider range of MICs than C. neoformans. MICs varied with Cryptococcus species and molecular type in dogs and cats, and MICs of VGIII isolates were most variable and may reflect phylogenetic diversity in this group. Because sequence types of dogs and cats reflect those infecting humans, these observations may also have implications for treatment of human cryptococcosis."

Rat alveolar macrophages (Ma) were used as nanoparticle delivery vectors. Uptake of AuNS (bare and PEGylated) was investigated in Ma. AuNS were incubated with Ma for 24 h. Phase contrast microscopy was used to visualize the distribution of loaded Ma in three-dimensional glioma spheroids. PTT efficacy was evaluated for both empty (Ma) and AuNS-loaded Ma (Ma(NS)) in both monolayers and spheroids consisting of C6 rat glioma cells and Ma. Monolayers/spheroids were irradiated for 5 min with light from an 810-nm diode laser at irradiances ranging from 7 to 28 W cm(-2). Monolayer survival was evaluated using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay while PTT efficacy in spheroids was determined from growth kinetics and live/dead fluorescence microscopy. PTT efficacy was investigated in vivo using a Sprague-Dawley rat glioma model. Five rats received direct intracranial injection of a mixture of 10(4) C6 glioma cells and, 2 days later, an equal number of Ma(NS). Three rats received laser treatment (810 nm; 10 min; 1 W) while the remaining two served as controls (no laser treatment). The uptake ratio of bare to PEGylated AuNS by Ma was 4:1. A significant photothermal effect was observed in vitro, albeit at relatively high radiant exposures (2.1-4.2 kJ cm(-2)). PTT proved effective in vivo in preventing or delaying tumor development in the PTT-treated animals."

In addition, few studies have estimated the effects of the constituents of either PM2.5 or UF particles.MethodsWe used a statewide cohort of > 100,000 women from the California Teachers Study who were followed from 2001 through 2007. Exposure data at the residential level were provided by a chemical transport model that computed pollutant concentrations from > 900 sources in California. Besides particle mass, monthly concentrations of 11 species and 8 sources or primary particles were generated at 4-km grids. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the association between the pollutants and all-cause, cardiovascular, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and respiratory mortality.ResultsWe observed statistically significant (p < 0.05) associations of IHD with PM2.5 mass, nitrate, elemental carbon (EC), copper (Cu), and secondary organics and the sources gas- and diesel-fueled vehicles, meat cooking, and high-sulfur fuel combustion. The hazard ratio estimate of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) for IHD in association with a 10-Î¼g/m3 increase in PM2.5 is consistent with findings from the American Cancer Society cohort. We also observed significant positive associations between IHD and several UF components including EC, Cu, metals, and mobile sources.ConclusionsUsing an emissions-based model with a 4-km spatial scale, we observed significant positive associations between IHD mortality and both fine and ultrafine particle species and sources. Our results suggest that the exposure model effectively measured local exposures and facilitated the examination of the relative toxicity of particle species."

"KLEEMAN, Michael J","The Ozoneâ€“Climate Penalty: Past, Present, and Future","Climate change is expected to increase global mean temperatures leading to higher tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations in already polluted regions, potentially eroding the benefits of expensive emission controls. The magnitude of the ""O3-climate penalty"" has generally decreased over the past three decades, which makes future predictions for climate impacts on air quality uncertain. Researchers attribute historical reductions in the O3-climate penalty to reductions in NOx emissions but have so far not extended this theory into a quantitative prediction for future effects. Here, we show that a three-dimensional air quality model can be used to map the behavior of the O3-climate penalty under varying NOx and VOC emissions in both NOx-limited and NOx-saturated conditions in Central and Southern California, respectively. Simulations suggest that the planned emissions control program for O3 precursors will not diminish the O3-climate penalty to zero as some observational studies might imply. The results further demonstrate that in a NOx-limited air basin, NOx control strategies alone are sufficient to both decrease the O3-climate penalty and mitigate O3 pollution, while in a NOx-saturated air basin, a modified emissions control plan that carefully chooses reductions in both NOx and VOC emissions may be necessary to eliminate the O3-climate penalty while simultaneously reducing base case O3 concentrations to desired levels. Additional modeling is needed to determine the behavior of the O3-climate penalty as NOx and VOC emissions evolve in other regions."

Most experiments were performed with an air-inert mixture at 0.1 MPa and about 298 K, where helium, carbon dioxide and xenon were separately used as inerts. Some experiments were also performed at 0.3 MPa and 298 K with air-xenon environments. The amount of inert gas in the environment was progressively increased until droplets could no longer be ignited. Droplet ignitability depended on the gravitational level as well as the inert gas in the environment. The amount of inert gas required to suppress combustion was generally higher in reduced gravity than normal gravity, and use of xenon required significantly higher mole fractions for suppression of combustion relative to helium or carbon dioxide. In general, increasing the amount of inert gas decreased burning rates. The data indicate that ambient gas transport properties play an important role in determining flammability and combustion behaviors of droplets. Comparison with other experimental data obtained with propanol droplets shows that ignitability and combustion characteristics of droplets can also be influenced by the fuel type."

To mimic these conditions, Lactobacillus plantarum was grown in a carbon-limited retentostat with complete biomass retention. The physiology of extremely slow-growing L. plantarum--as studied by genome-scale modeling and transcriptomics--was fundamentally different from that of stationary-phase cells. Stress resistance mechanisms were not massively induced during transition to extremely slow growth. The energy-generating metabolism was remarkably stable and remained largely based on the conversion of glucose to lactate. The combination of metabolic and transcriptomic analyses revealed behaviors involved in interactions with the environment, more particularly with plants: production of plant hormones or precursors thereof, and preparedness for the utilization of plant-derived substrates. Accordingly, the production of compounds interfering with plant root development was demonstrated in slow-growing L. plantarum. Thus, conditions of slow growth and limited substrate availability seem to trigger a plant environment-like response, even in the absence of plant-derived material, suggesting that this might constitute an intrinsic behavior in L. plantarum."
"RONALD, Pamela C",The cloned avirulence gene avrPto induces disease resistance in tomato cultivars containing the Pto resistance gene.,"Resistance of tomato plants to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato race 0 is controlled by the locus Pto. A bacterial avirulence gene was cloned by constructing a cosmid library from an avirulent P. syringae pv. tomato race, conjugating the recombinants into a strain of P. syringae pv. maculicola virulent on a tomato cultivar containing Pto, and screening for those clones that converted the normally virulent phenotype to avirulence. The cloned gene, designated avrPto, reduced multiplication of P. syringae pv. tomato transconjugants specifically on Pto tomato lines, as demonstrated by bacterial growth curve analyses. Analysis of F2 populations revealed cosegregation of resistance to P. syringae pv. tomato transconjugants carrying avrPto with resistance to P. syringae pv. tomato race 0. Surprisingly, mutation of avrPto in P. syringae pv. tomato race 0 does not eliminate the avirulent phenotype of race 0, suggesting that additional, as yet uncharacterized, avirulence genes and/or resistance genes may contribute to specificity in the avrPto-Pto interaction. Genetic analysis indicates that this resistance gene(s) would be tightly linked to Pto. Interestingly, P. syringae pv. glycinea transconjugants carrying avrPto elicit a typical hypersensitive resistant response in the soybean cultivar Centennial, suggesting conservation of Pto function between two crop plants, tomato and soybean."

More importantly, over 90% of coastal wetlands have been destroyed in many regions of California.  In light of this decline and the recognized importance of eelgrass populations to the overall health of coastal systems, there is a significant need to understand patterns of genetic variation in these populations.  This information is critical to assessing the ecological interactions among eelgrass and its associated species.  Furthermore, due to the priority of these systems for restoration and conservation projects, research examining the role of genetic diversity in ecosystem function is vital to ensure the success of these attempts and the future health of Z marina populations.  To address these goals, I will evaluate patterns of genetic variation within and among eelgrass populations.  This information will then be incorporated into experiments examining the linkages between genetic diversity, community structure, and ecosystem function.  Ultimately, the results of these experiments can be utilized to plan and evaluate eelgrass restoration efforts."

The causal state equivalence relation defines a new subclass of renewal processes with a finite number of causal states despite having an unbounded interevent count distribution. We use the resulting formulae to analyze the output of the parametrized Simple Nonunifilar Source, generated by a simple two-state hidden Markov model, but with an infinite-state Îµ-machine presentation. All in all, the results lay the groundwork for analyzing more complex processes with infinite statistical complexity and infinite excess entropy."

However, finite elements are non-conforming on quadtree meshes due to level-mismatches between adjacent elements, which results in the presence of so-called hanging nodes. In this study, we use meshfree (natural-neighbor, nn) basis functions on a reference element combined with an affine map to construct conforming approximations on quadtree meshes. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed h-adaptive finite element method. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

As such, neutrophils are of great interest as targets to treat and prevent ischemic stroke. After stroke, neutrophils respond rapidly promoting blood-brain barrier disruption, cerebral edema, and brain injury. A surge of neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species, proteases, and cytokines are released as neutrophils interact with cerebral endothelium. Neutrophils also are linked to the major processes that cause ischemic stroke, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis. Thrombosis is promoted through interactions with platelets, clotting factors, and release of prothrombotic molecules. In atherosclerosis, neutrophils promote plaque formation and rupture by generating oxidized-low density lipoprotein, enhancing monocyte infiltration, and degrading the fibrous cap. In experimental studies targeting neutrophils can improve stroke. However, early human studies have been met with challenges, and suggest that selective targeting of neutrophils may be required. Several properties of neutrophil are beneficial and thus may important to preserve in patients with stroke including antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, and neuroprotective functions."
"ANDER, Bradley P",Molecular markers and mechanisms of stroke: RNA studies of blood in animals and humans,"Whole genome expression microarrays can be used to study gene expression in blood, which comes in part from leukocytes, immature platelets, and red blood cells. Since these cells are important in the pathogenesis of stroke, RNA provides an index of these cellular responses to stroke. Our studies in rats have shown specific gene expression changes 24 â€‰hours after ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, status epilepticus, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, global ischemia, and following brief focal ischemia that simulated transient ischemic attacks in humans. Human studies show gene expression changes following ischemic stroke. These gene profiles predict a second cohort with >90% sensitivity and specificity. Gene profiles for ischemic stroke caused by large-vessel atherosclerosis and cardioembolism have been described that predict a second cohort with >85% sensitivity and specificity. Atherosclerotic genes were associated with clotting, platelets, and monocytes, and cardioembolic genes were associated with inflammation, infection, and neutrophils. These gene profiles predicted the cause of stroke in 58% of cryptogenic patients. These studies will provide diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic markers, and will advance our understanding of stroke in humans. New techniques to measure all coding and noncoding RNAs along with alternatively spliced transcripts will markedly advance molecular studies of human stroke."

This gene is a zinc-finger/CCT domain transcription factor (ZCCT-1) down-regulated by vernalization. In barley, there are three related and linked ZCCT genes designated VRN-H1a, b, and c. A deletion of these three genes was observed in six putative spring induced mutants from winter barley variety 'Chikurin Ibaraki I'. However, analysis of additional molecular markers demonstrated that these deletions were originated by outcrossing with a spring barley variety carrying the natural ZCCT deletion. Hybridization of Southern blots from 84 barley varieties with a wheat ZCCT1 probe showed three or more fragments in 23 winter varieties but none in 60 out of the 61 vrn-H2 spring varieties. The vrn-H2-spring barley variety 'Fan' showed only the ZCCT-Hb gene, suggesting that this gene is not sufficient to determine winter growth habit in barley. We also show in this study, that the effect of VRN-H2 on flowering time completely disappears in the presence of the dominant Vrn-H1 allele in a Morex x Hordeum spontaneum segregating population. A different result was described before for the epistatic interactions between the orthologous genes in diploid wheat. We discuss the possible causes of these differences."

"WINTER, Sebastian E",The Flagellar Regulator TviA Reduces Pyroptosis by Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhi,"To discern virulent from innocuous microbes, the innate immune system senses events associated with bacterial access to immunoprivileged sites such as the host cell cytosol. One such pathway is triggered by the cytosolic delivery of flagellin, the major subunit of the flagellum, by bacterial secretion systems. This leads to inflammasome activation and subsequent proinflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) of the infected phagocyte. In this study, we demonstrate that the causative agent of typhoid fever, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, can partially subvert this critical innate immune recognition event. The transcriptional regulator TviA, which is absent from Salmonella serovars associated with human gastroenteritis, repressed the expression of flagellin during infection of human macrophage-like (THP-1) cells. This mechanism allowed S. Typhi to dampen inflammasome activation, leading to reduced interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) secretion and diminished cell death. Likewise, the introduction of the tviA gene in nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium reduced flagellin-induced pyroptosis. These data suggest that gene regulation of virulence factors enables S. Typhi to evade innate immune recognition by concealing a pathogen-induced process from being sensed by the inflammasome."

Functional boundaries of cortical fields were directly related to myeloarchitectonic boundaries. Our results demonstrated that most of the neocortex is occupied by the visual, auditory, and somatosensory areas. Specifically, a small area 17, or primary visual area (V1), was located on the caudomedial pole of the neocortex; a large auditory cortex (AC), which contains the primary auditory area (A1) and other auditory fields, encompassed almost the entire temporal pole; and a large area 3b, or primary somatosensory area (S1), contained a complete representation of the contralateral body surface. Furthermore, these areas were coextensive with distinct myeloarchitectonic appearances. We also observed that the AC appeared to be disproportionately large in the prairie vole compared with other rodents. In addition, we found that both primary and nonprimary areas contained neurons that responded to auditory stimulation. Finally, we observed within S1 a disproportionate amount of cortex that was devoted to representing the perioral hairs and the snout and also that neurons within this representation had very small receptive fields. We discuss the expanded auditory domain and the enlarged representation of perioral hairs as they relate to the specialized life style of the prairie vole."
"BALES, Karen L",Is Play Behavior Sexually Dimorphic in Monogamous Species?,"Monogamy is a relatively rare social system in mammals, occurring only in about 3% of mammalian species. Monogamous species are characterized by the formation of pair-bonds, biparental care, and a very low level of sexual dimorphism. Whereas in most polygynous species males engage in more rough-and-tumble play than females, we predicted that males and females of monogamous species would have similar, or monomorphic, play behavior. In this study, we focused on two monogamous species: coppery titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) and prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). We documented the development of play behavior in both species, and quantified different types of play behavior. We did not find any sex differences in either species in the frequencies and types of play. However, we did find sex differences in the choice of play partner in titi monkeys: female offspring spent a higher proportion of time playing with their father, while male offspring played equally with their mother and father. It is possible that rough-and-tumble play behavior is monomorphic in many monogamous mammals, perhaps reflecting differences from polygynous species in the effects of exposure to early androgens or in the estrogen receptor distribution. However, more subtle differences in monomorphic play behavior, such as choice of partner, may still exist. Â© 2008 The Authors."

"CONNON, Richard",Physiological stress biomarkers reveal stocking density effects in late larval Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus),"Suboptimal fish stocking densities in experimental systems may elicit stress responses that can affect experimental results. Fish species, age and size, water chemistry and flow, and physical characteristics of the experimental system (e.g., tank, cage) are among the parameters to be considered when determining stocking densities. However, systematic studies to define fish densities minimizing stress in experimental systems are rarely performed. This is particularly true when working with species of low aquaculture value or a non-model test species such as the Delta Smelt (. Hypomesus transpacificus). The aim of this study was to use physiological stress biomarkers to determine suitable fish densities for specific experimental vessels routinely used for this species. We maintained late larval Delta Smelt (60. days post-hatch; dph) over a period of 24. h, at five different densities: 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56 fish per 8. L circular fish tank. We assessed whole body cortisol and transcriptomic biomarkers that lead to cortisol production to quantify stress levels. Both marker types delivered similar results. Cortisol levels were lowest at densities of 28 and 42 fish per tank, whereas lowest fish densities (7 and 14 fish per tank) evoked the highest stress levels. Genes such as Mineralocorticoid Receptor 1 and Glucocorticoid Receptor 2, as well as 11-Beta-Hydroxysteroid-Dehydrogenase-2 depicted the lowest expression levels at stocking densities 28 and 42, and elevated expression levels for stocking densities 7 and 14. Our data support the observations that late larval Delta Smelt should be exposed, acclimated, and cultured in groups rather than as individuals or in low numbers. This study indicates the importance of adequately defining experimental conditions that minimize stress, specifically when stress is measured as an endpoint. In addition to classical cortisol measurements, responses of the transcriptome also appear suitable in assessing stress responses in fish, and in determining optimal holding conditions, particularly if short-term responses are the study focus.Statement of relevance. The study highlights the importance of evaluating stress in order to determine species-specific stocking densities. The results are thus relevant to a wide audience in the field of aquaculture and experimental biology."

"MCDONALD, Craig M",Becker's muscular dystrophy,"Fifteen subjects with Becker's muscular dystrophy (BMD) were studied prospectively over a 10-yr period to provide a profile of impairment and disability. Proximal lower extremity musculature (particularly the hip and knee extensors), ankle dorsiflexors, and neck flexors showed significant early weakness. Extensor muscle groups were weaker than flexor muscles at the elbow and knee. The mean manual muscle test (MMT) strength grade for all muscle groups combined was 3.7 Â± 0.8 MMT units. There was a slowly progressive decline in strength, only -0.31 MMT units per decade, and the decline was relatively equal in all muscle groups. There was not side dominance. Severe contractures did not appear to be a problem until after transition to a wheelchair, and scoliosis was rare. Restrictive lung disease occurred as a late complication in a small percentage of cases; however, maximal expiratory pressure was significantly reduced early in the disease. Only two individuals (19%) had severe restrictive lung disease and a history of significant respiratory complications. There was a slight but significant decline in forced vital capacity and maximal expiratory pressure with age and disease duration. The cardiomyopathy in BMD appeared to be disproportionately severe in some cases. Eleven individuals (73%) had abnormal electrocardiograms, and five (25%) had a history of significant cardiovascular complication, with no age or disease duration effect. Functional evaluations and timed motor performance tests showed only mild disability in most individuals. Mean intellectual and neuropsychologic function was within normal limits, but with a large variability in intelligence quotient scores. This report and others suggest a tremendous heterogeneity of severity among males with BMD."

"EISEN, Jonathan A",Gene Conservation among Endospore-Forming Bacteria Reveals Additional Sporulation Genes in Bacillus subtilis,"The capacity to form endospores is unique to certain members of the low-G+C group of Gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes) and requires signature sporulation genes that are highly conserved across members of distantly related genera, such as Clostridium and Bacillus. Using gene conservation among endospore-forming bacteria, we identified eight previously uncharacterized genes that are enriched among endospore-forming species. The expression of five of these genes was dependent on sporulation-specific transcription factors. Mutants of none of the genes exhibited a conspicuous defect in sporulation, but mutants of two, ylxY and ylyA, were outcompeted by a wild-type strain under sporulation-inducing conditions, but not during growth. In contrast, a ylmC mutant displayed a slight competitive advantage over the wild type specific to sporulation-inducing conditions. The phenotype of a ylyA mutant was ascribed to a defect in spore germination efficiency. This work demonstrates the power of combining phylogenetic profiling with reverse genetics and gene-regulatory studies to identify unrecognized genes that contribute to a conserved developmental process."

"LEIN, Pamela J",Longitudinal assessment of occupational exposures to the organophosphorous insecticides chlorpyrifos and profenofos in Egyptian cotton field workers,"Chlorpyrifos (CPF) and profenofos (PFF) are organophosphorus (OP) insecticides that are applied seasonally in Egypt to cotton fields. Urinary trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy), a specific CPF metabolite, and 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol (BCP), a specific PFF metabolite, are biomarkers of exposure, while inhibition of blood butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities are effect biomarkers that may be associated with neurotoxicity. Urinary TCPy and BCP and blood BChE and AChE activities were measured in 37 adult Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture workers during and after 9-17 consecutive days of CPF application followed by an application of PFF (9-11 days), and a second CPF application (5 days) in 2008. During the OP applications, urinary TCPy and BCP levels were significantly higher than baseline levels, remained elevated following the application periods, and were associated with an exposure related inhibition of blood BChE and AChE. Analysis of blood AChE levels before and after the PFF application period suggests that individual workers with peak BCP levels greater than 1000 Î¼g/g creatinine exhibited further inhibition of blood AChE with PFF application, demonstrating that PFF exposure had a negative impact on AChE activity in this highly exposed worker population. While large interindividual differences in exposure were observed throughout this longitudinal study (peak urinary BCP and peak TCPy levels for individuals ranging from 13.4 to 8052 and 16.4 to 30,107 Î¼g/g creatinine, respectively), these urinary biomarkers were highly correlated within workers (r=0.75, p<0.001). This suggests that the relative exposures to CPF and PFF were highly correlated for a given worker. The variable exposures between job classification and work site suggest that job title and work location should not be used as the sole basis for categorizing OP exposures when assessing neurobehavioral and other health outcomes in Egyptian cotton field workers. Together, these findings will be important in educating the Egyptian insecticide application workers in order to encourage the development and implementation of work practices and personal protective equipment to reduce their exposure to CPF and PFF."

"HILL, Michael R",Analytical tools for residual stress enhancement of rotorcraft damage tolerance,"There are several methods of improving the damage tolerance life of metals commonly used on rotorcraft. These methods have been used conservatively without adequate practical, reliable and validated analytical methods for fracture mechanics analyses to account for the complete benefits. This program examined one life improvement method (cold working) on open-hole specimens, loaded-hole specimens, and component level specimens of aluminum structures. The improved integrated analysis procedure will be compared with baseline damage tolerance analyses. The improved procedure shows a more precise and longer predicted life and hence fewer inspections during the life of the aircraft. In order to account for the residual stresses created by cold working, a closed form solution using plasticity methods was used along with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) analysis. The results from the closed form solution are integrated with finite element stress analysis that provides input to a crack growth analysis, which therefore accounts for the cold working. The results of the analysis procedure are presented and compared with representative specimen testing. The three different geometries were modeled and tested. Open hole testing was performed for two thicknesses (.08â€³ and .19â€³), including both bare and clad 7075-T6 aluminum alloy sheet. A loaded hole test was also performed at the same thicknesses for bare and clad 7075-T6 aluminum alloy sheet. A nested angle test was run as a representative structural detail. The parts were cold worked and reamed to the maximum size based on specifications. The tests were performed to validate methods of accounting for residual stresses arising from cold working the holes. Copyright Â© 2011 by the American Helicopter Society International, Inc.

"CHEN, Yi-Je",The Potassium Channel KCa3.1 as New Therapeutic Target for the Prevention of Obliterative Airway Disease,"BackgroundThe calcium-activated potassium channel KCa3.1 is critically involved in T-cell activation as well as in the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. We sought to investigate whether KCa3.1 contributes to the pathogenesis of obliterative airway disease (OAD) and whether knockout or pharmacologic blockade would prevent the development of OAD.MethodsTracheas from CBA donors were heterotopically transplanted into the omentum of C57Bl/6J wild-type or KCa3.1 mice. C57Bl/6J recipients were either left untreated or received the KCa3.1 blocker TRAM-34 (120 mg/kg/day). Histopathology and immunologic assays were performed on postoperative day 5 or 28.ResultsSubepithelial T-cell and macrophage infiltration on postoperative day 5, as seen in untreated allografts, was significantly reduced in the KCa3.1 and TRAM-34 groups. Also, systemic Th1 activation was significantly and Th2 mildly reduced by KCa3.1 knockout or blockade. After 28 days, luminal obliteration of tracheal allografts was reduced from 89%Â±21% in untreated recipients to 53%Â±26% (P=0.010) and 59%Â±33% (P=0.032) in KCa3.1 and TRAM-34-treated animals, respectively. The airway epithelium was mostly preserved in syngeneic grafts, mostly destroyed in the KCa3.1 and TRAM-34 groups, and absent in untreated allografts. Allografts triggered an antibody response in untreated recipients, which was significantly reduced in KCa3.1 animals. KCa3.1 was detected in T cells, airway epithelial cells, and myofibroblasts. TRAM-34 dose-dependently suppressed proliferation of wild-type C57B/6J splenocytes but did not show any effect on KCa3.1 splenocytes.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that KCa3.1 channels are involved in the pathogenesis of OAD and that KCa3.1 blockade holds promise to reduce OAD development."

"LEACH, Kent",Reduced Serum and Hypoxic Culture Conditions Enhance the Osteogenic Potential of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells,"UnlabelledCurrent protocols for inducing osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) in culture for tissue engineering applications depend on the use of biochemical supplements. However, standard in vitro culture conditions expose cells to ambient oxygen concentrations and high levels of serum (21% O2, 10% FBS) that do not accurately recapitulate the physiological milieu. While we and others have examined MSC behavior under hypoxia, the synergistic effect of low serum levels, such as those present in ischemic injury sites, on osteogenic differentiation has not been clearly examined. We hypothesized that a concomitant reduction of serum and O2 would enhance in vitro osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by more accurately mimicking the fracture microenvironment. We show that serum deprivation, in conjunction with hypoxia, potentiates osteogenic differentiation in MSCs. These data demonstrate the role of serum levels in regulating osteogenesis and its importance in optimizing MSC differentiation strategies.HighlightsSerum levels, in addition to hypoxia, have a significant effect on MSC osteogenic differentiation. Both naÃ¯ve and osteogenically induced MSCs exhibit higher osteogenic markers in reduced serum. MSCs deposit the most calcium under 5% O2 in osteogenic media supplemented with 5% FBS. Standard culture conditions (21% O2, 10% FBS) may not be optimal for MSC osteogenic differentiation."

We examined the association of circulating levels of vitamin C and E with incident whole knee radiographic OA (WKROA).MethodsWe performed a nested case-control study of incident WKROA in MOST, a cohort of 3,026 men and women aged 50-79 years with, or at high risk of, knee OA. Incident cases were knees without either tibiofemoral (TF) or patellofemoral (PF) OA at baseline that developed TF and/or PF OA by 30-month follow-up. Two control knees per case were selected from those eligible for WKROA that did not develop it. Vitamin C and E (alpha-tocopherol) assays were done on baseline supernatant plasma (PCA) and serum samples, respectively. We examined the association of gender-specific tertiles of vitamin C and E with incident WKROA using logistic regression with GEE, adjusting for age, gender, and obesity.ResultsSubjects without WKROA at baseline who were in the highest tertile of vitamin C had a higher incidence of WKROA [adjusted OR = 2.20 (95% CI: 1.12-4.33); P-value = 0.021], with similar results for the highest tertile of vitamin E [adjusted OR = 1.89 (1.02-3.50); P-value = 0.042], compared to those in the lowest tertiles. P-values for the trend of vitamin C and E tertiles and incident WKROA were 0.019 and 0.030, respectively.ConclusionsHigher levels of circulating vitamin C and E did not provide protection against incident radiographic knee OA, and may be associated with an increased risk of knee OA."

"GENETOS, Damian C",Parathyroid hormone regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor signaling in osteoblastic cells,"Osteoblasts perceive and respond to changes in their pericellular environment, including biophysical signals and oxygen availability, to elicit an anabolic or catabolic response. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) affects each arm of skeletal remodeling, with net anabolic or catabolic effects dependent upon duration of exposure. Similarly, the capacity of osteoblastic cells to perceive pericellular oxygen has a profound effect on skeletal mass and architecture, as mice expressing stable hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1Î± and -2Î± demonstrate age-dependent increases in bone volume per tissue volume and osteoblast number. Further, HIF levels and signaling can be influenced in an oxygen-independent manner. Because the cellular mechanisms involved in PTH regulation of the skeleton remain vague, we sought whether PTH could influence HIF-1Î± expression and HIF-Î±-driven luciferase activity independently of altered oxygen availability. Using UMR106.01 mature osteoblasts, we observed that 100nM hPTH(1-34) decreased HIF-1Î± and HIF-responsive luciferase activity in a process involving heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and cyclic AMP but not intracellular calcium. Altering activity of the small GTPase RhoA and its effector kinase ROCK altered HIF-Î±-driven luciferase activity in the absence and presence of PTH. Taken together, these data introduce PTH as a regulator of oxygen-independent HIF-1Î± levels through a mechanism involving cyclic AMP, Hsp90, and the cytoskeleton."

We present a novel ChIP-seq workflow for the archaea using the model organism Halobacterium salinarum sp. NRC-1 and demonstrate its application for mapping the genome-wide binding sites of natively expressed transcription factors. This end-to-end pipeline is the first protocol for ChIP-seq in archaea, with methods and tools for each stage from gene tagging to data analysis and biological discovery. Genome-wide binding sites for transcription factors with many binding sites (TfbD) are identified with sensitivity, while retaining specificity in the identification the smaller regulons (bacteriorhodopsin-activator protein). Chromosomal tagging of target proteins with a compact epitope facilitates a standardized and cost-effective workflow that is compatible with high-throughput immunoprecipitation of natively expressed transcription factors. The Pique package, an open-source bioinformatics method, is presented for identification of binding events. Relative to ChIP-Chip and qPCR, this workflow offers a robust catalog of protein-DNA binding events with improved spatial resolution and significantly decreased cost. While this study focuses on the application of ChIP-seq in H. salinarum sp. NRC-1, our workflow can also be adapted for use in other archaea and bacteria with basic genetic tools."

Past findings in adolescents with anxiety or at risk for anxiety have revealed hypersensitive behavioral and neural responses to higher value rewards with correct performance. This hypersensitivity to highly valued (salient) actions suggests that the value of actions is determined not only by outcome magnitude, but also by the degree to which the outcome is contingent on correct performance. Thus, contingency and incentive value might each modulate reward responses in unique ways in anxiety. Using fMRI with a monetary reward task, striatal response to cue anticipation is compared in 18 clinically anxious and 20 healthy adolescents. This task manipulates orthogonally reward contingency and incentive value. Findings suggest that contingency modulates the neural response to incentive magnitude differently in the two groups. Specifically, during the contingent condition, right-striatal response tracks incentive value in anxious, but not healthy, adolescents. During the noncontingent condition, striatal response is bilaterally stronger to low than to high incentive in anxious adolescents, while healthy adolescents exhibit the expected opposite pattern. Both contingency and reward magnitude differentiate striatal activation in anxious versus healthy adolescents. These findings may reflect exaggerated concern about performance and/or alterations of striatal coding of reward value in anxious adolescents. Abnormalities in reward function in anxiety may have treatment implications."

"GRAY, John A",Non-Ionotropic NMDA Receptor Signaling Drives Activity-Induced Dendritic Spine Shrinkage,"The elimination of dendritic spine synapses is a critical step in the refinement of neuronal circuits during development of the cerebral cortex. Several studies have shown that activity-induced shrinkage and retraction of dendritic spines depend on activation of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR), which leads to influx of extracellular calcium ions and activation of calcium-dependent phosphatases that modify regulators of the spine cytoskeleton, suggesting that influx of extracellular calcium ions drives spine shrinkage. Intriguingly, a recent report revealed a novel non-ionotropic function of the NMDAR in the regulation of synaptic strength, which relies on glutamate binding but is independent of ion flux through the receptor (Nabavi et al., 2013). Here, we tested whether non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling could also play a role in driving structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Using two-photon glutamate uncaging and time-lapse imaging of rat hippocampal CA1 neurons, we show that low-frequency glutamatergic stimulation results in shrinkage of dendritic spines even in the presence of the NMDAR d-serine/glycine binding site antagonist 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7CK), which fully blocks NMDAR-mediated currents and Ca(2+) transients. Notably, application of 7CK or MK-801 also converts spine enlargement resulting from a high-frequency uncaging stimulus into spine shrinkage, demonstrating that strong Ca(2+) influx through the NMDAR normally overcomes a non-ionotropic shrinkage signal to drive spine growth. Our results support a model in which NMDAR signaling, independent of ion flux, drives structural shrinkage at spiny synapses.Significance statementDendritic spine elimination is vital for the refinement of neural circuits during development and has been linked to improvements in behavioral performance in the adult. Spine shrinkage and elimination have been widely accepted to depend on Ca(2+) influx through NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) in conjunction with long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength. Here, we use two-photon glutamate uncaging and time-lapse imaging to show that non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling can drive shrinkage of dendritic spines, independent of NMDAR-mediated Ca(2+) influx. Signaling through p38 MAPK was required for this activity-dependent spine shrinkage. Our results provide fundamental new insights into the signaling mechanisms that support experience-dependent changes in brain structure."

However, the contributions of eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, and the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi ternary complex (TC) in stabilizing the 43 S PIC are poorly defined. We have reconstituted the human 43 S PIC and used fluorescence anisotropy to systematically measure the affinity of eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF3j in the presence of different combinations of 43 S PIC components. Our data reveal a complicated network of interactions that result in high affinity binding of all 43 S PIC components with the 40 S subunit. Human eIF1 and eIF1A bind cooperatively to the 40 S subunit, revealing an evolutionarily conserved interaction. Negative cooperativity is observed between the binding of eIF3j and the binding of eIF1, eIF1A, and TC with the 40 S subunit. To overcome this, eIF3 dramatically increases the affinity of eIF1 and eIF3j for the 40 S subunit. Recruitment of TC also increases the affinity of eIF1 for the 40 S subunit, but this interaction has an important indirect role in increasing the affinity of eIF1A for the 40 S subunit. Together, our data provide a more complete thermodynamic framework of the human 43 S PIC and reveal important interactions between its components to maintain its stability."
"VILLA, Nancy",Phosphorylation Stoichiometries of Human Eukaryotic Initiation Factors,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factors are the principal molecular effectors regulating the process converting nucleic acid to functional protein. Commonly referred to as eIFs (eukaryotic initiation factors), this suite of proteins is comprised of at least 25 individual subunits that function in a coordinated, regulated, manner during mRNA translation. Multiple facets of eIF regulation have yet to be elucidated; however, many of the necessary protein factors are phosphorylated. Herein, we have isolated, identified and quantified phosphosites from eIF2, eIF3, and eIF4G generated from log phase grown HeLa cell lysates. Our investigation is the first study to globally quantify eIF phosphosites and illustrates differences in abundance of phosphorylation between the residues of each factor. Thus, identification of those phosphosites that exhibit either high or low levels of phosphorylation under log phase growing conditions may aid researchers to concentrate their investigative efforts to specific phosphosites that potentially harbor important regulatory mechanisms germane to mRNA translation."

The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in the metabolomic profile of males and females as they developed IBD. Using the IL-10 gene-deficient mouse model of IBD and wild-type mice, urine at age 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks was collected and analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Multivariate data analysis was employed to assess differences in metabolomic profiles that occurred as a consequence of IBD development and severity (at week 20). These changes were contrasted to those that occurred as a consequence of gender. Our results demonstrate that both IL-10 gene-deficient and wild-type mice exhibit gender-related changes in urinary metabolomic profile over time. Some male-female separating metabolites are common to both IL-10 gene-deficient and control wild-type mice and, therefore, appear to be related predominantly to gender maturation. In addition, we were able to identify gender-separating metabolites that are unique for IL-10 gene-deficient and wild-type mice and, therefore, may be indicative of a gender-specific involvement in the development and severity of the intestinal inflammation. The comparison of the gender-separating metabolomic profile from IL-10 gene-deficient mice and wild-type mice during the development of IBD allowed us to identify changes in profile patterns that appear to be imperative in the development of intestinal inflammation, but yet central to gender-related differences in IBD development. The knowledge of metabolomic profile differences by gender and by disease severity has potential clinical implications in the design of both biomarkers of disease as well as the development of optimal therapies."

These transgenic lines displayed no visible developmental or morphological phenotypes when grown under conditions of no water stress. Major photosynthetic parameters were also not affected by PIP1 down regulation. However, low levels of PIP1 expression resulted in greater leaf hydraulic resistance (an increase of 27%), which effectively implicated PIP1 role in water transport. Additionally, the expression level of PIP1 genes in the various transgenic lines was correlated with reductions in mesophyll conductance to CO2 (gm), suggesting that in poplar, these aquaporins influenced membrane permeability to CO2. Overall, although analysis showed that PIP1 genes contributed to the mass transfer of water and CO2 in poplar leaves, their down-regulation did not dramatically impair the physiological needs of this fast growing tree when cultivated under conditions of no stress."

CFC is genetically heterogeneous and caused by gene mutations in the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The major features of CFC include characteristic craniofacial dysmorphology, congenital heart disease, dermatologic abnormalities, growth retardation, and intellectual disability. It is essential that this condition be differentiated from other RASopathies, as a correct diagnosis is important for appropriate medical management and determining recurrence risk. Children and adults with CFC require multidisciplinary care from specialists, and the need for comprehensive management has been apparent to families and health care professionals caring for affected individuals. To address this need, CFC International, a nonprofit family support organization that provides a forum for information, support, and facilitation of research in basic medical and social issues affecting individuals with CFC, organized a consensus conference. Experts in multiple medical specialties provided clinical management guidelines for pediatricians and other care providers. These guidelines will assist in an accurate diagnosis of individuals with CFC, provide best practice recommendations, and facilitate long-term medical care."

While the specific drugs associated with drug-induced seizures may vary by geography and change over time, common reported causes include antidepressants, stimulants and antihistamines. Seizures occur generally as a result of inadequate inhibitory influences (e.g., gamma aminobutyric acid, GABA) or excessive excitatory stimulation (e.g. glutamate) although many other neurotransmitters play a role. Most drug-induced seizures are self-limited. However, status epilepticus occurs in up to 10% of cases. Prolonged or recurrent seizures can lead to serious complications and require vigorous supportive care and anticonvulsant drugs. Benzodiazepines are generally accepted as the first line anticonvulsant therapy for drug-induced seizures. If benzodiazepines fail to halt seizures promptly, second line drugs include barbiturates and propofol. If isoniazid poisoning is a possibility, pyridoxine is given. Continuous infusion of one or more anticonvulsants may be required in refractory status epilepticus. There is no role for phenytoin in the treatment of drug-induced seizures. The potential role of ketamine and levetiracetam is promising but not established."

We examined the relation between age of substance use initiation and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the core reward processing (nucleus accumbens; NAcc) to cognitive control (prefrontal cortex; PFC) brain networks.MethodAdolescents in a longitudinal study of Mexican-origin youth reported their substance use annually from ages 10 to 16 years. At age 16, 69 adolescents participated in a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Seed-based correlational analyses were conducted using regions of interest in bilateral NAcc.ResultsThe earlier that adolescents initiated substance use, the stronger the connectivity between bilateral NAcc and right dorsolateral PFC, right dorsomedial PFC, right pre-supplementary motor area, right inferior parietal lobule, and left medial temporal gyrus.DiscussionThe regions that demonstrated significant positive linear relationships between the number of adolescent years using substances and connectivity with NAcc are nodes in the right frontoparietal network, which is central to cognitive control. The coupling of reward and cognitive control networks may be a mechanism through which earlier onset of substance use is related to brain function over time, a trajectory that may be implicated in subsequent substance use disorders."

These steroids may cross the blood-brain barrier and have dampening effects in the central nervous system.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate if the infusion of a progesterone derivative (allopregnanolone) in a healthy neonatal foal would induce clinical signs compatible with NMS.<h4>Methods</h4>A healthy neonatal foal from a healthy mare with a normal gestation (length, no complications), birth and placenta was infused with allopregnanolone to observe its neurobehavioural effects. Heparinised blood samples were collected pre- and post infusion to determine various progestagen concentrations using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. A second healthy neonatal foal was infused with ethanol and saline for comparison of clinical observations.<h4>Results</h4>Infusion of allopregnanolone resulted in obtundation, lack of affinity for the mare and decreased response to external stimuli. These effects were short-lasting and associated with measurable concentrations of progestagens.<h4>Conclusions and potential relevance</h4>Infusion of a steroid metabolite to a healthy neonatal foal resulted in neurobehavioural alterations compatible with those observed in foals with NMS. These findings suggest that increased progestagen concentrations may be responsible for some of the behavioural changes observed in foals with NMS."

Several modifications are introduced to more realistically simulate some of the ice microphysical processes. In addition to the assumption that ice nuclei number concentration is a function of temperature, a new and separate assumption is developed in which ice crystal number concentration is a function of ice amount. Related changes in ice microphysics are introduced, and the impact of sedimentation of ice crystals is also investigated. In an idealized thunderstorm simulation, the distribution of simulated clouds and precipitation is sensitive to the assumptions in microphysical processes, whereas the impact of the sedimentation of cloud ice is small. Overall, the modifications introduced to microphysical processes play a role in significantly reducing cloud ice and increasing snow at colder temperatures and slightly increasing cloud ice and decreasing snow at warmer temperatures. A mesoscale simulation experiment for a heavy rainfall case indicates that impact due to the inclusion of sedimentation of cloud ice is not negligible but is still smaller than that due to the microphysics changes. Together with the sedimentation of ice, the new microphysics reveals a significant improvement in high-cloud amount, surface precipitation, and large-scale mean temperature through a better representation of the ice cloud-radiation feedback.

"JIANG, Jiming",Distribution-free prediction intervals in mixed linear models,"This paper considers prediction intervals for a future observation in the context of mixed linear models. For such prediction problems, it is reasonable to assume that the future observation is independent of the current ones. Our approach is distribution-free, that is, we do not assume that the distributions of the random effects and errors are normal or specified up to a finite number of parameters. We show that for standard mixed linear models, a simple method based on the (regression) residuals works well for constructing prediction intervals. For nonstandard mixed linear models, however, a more complicated method may have to be used, based on estimation of the distribution of the random effects. Simulation studies compare prediction intervals based on the ordinary least squares estimators and those based on the empirical best linear unbiased estimators. We apply the method to a data set regarding lead contamination of soil."

The constrictions imposed by this anatomy on phasmid gut microbiology, its connections to recently released Phasmatodea transcriptomes, and how it differs from the anatomy of related orders in the Polyneoptera are discussed. All Phasmatodea have ridged proventriculi lined or covered with small spines. Anterior projections of the midgut, sometimes described as gastric caeca, are only found in Euphasmatodea and often obscure the proventriculus. We define the cardia as the complex of foregut and midgut tissue where the type II peritrophic matrix is produced. Appendices of the midgut are an autapomorphy for Phasmatodea, but Timema have fewer and larger appendices relative to body size. We suggest caeca-like projections and the loss of large, proventricular teeth are apomorphies of Euphasmatodea. We identify a possible facultative symbiosis in Eucalyptus-feeding species that requires further study."

While the performance of most ANN algorithms depends heavily on the distributions of the data and query points, our approach has a very regular data access pattern. It performs as well as state of the art methods on easy distributions with small values of k, and much more quickly on more difficult problem instances. Irrespective of the distribution and also roughly of the size of the set of input data points, we can find 50 ANNs for 1M queries at a rate of about 1200 queries/ms."

In particular, we utilize a two-level hierarchical sort for BWT, design a novel scan-based parallel MTF algorithm, and implement a parallel reduction scheme to build the Huffman tree. For each algorithm, we perform detailed performance analysis, discuss its strengths and weaknesses, and suggest future directions for improvements. Overall, our GPU implementation is dominated by BWT performance and is 2.78x slower than bzip2, with BWT and MTF-Huffman respectively 2.89x and 1.34x slower on average. Â© 2012 IEEE."

Cortical neurofibrillary tangle pathology correlated with lower total cerebral brain (Î²Â±SE=-0.04Â±0.01, P=0.004) and hippocampal volumes (Î²Â±SE=-0.03Â±0.02, P=0.044) and larger temporal horns (log-transformed, Î²Â±SE=0.05Â±0.01, P=0.001). Similar findings were seen between total/cortical neuritic plaques and total cerebral brain and temporal horn volume. White matter hyperintensities (also log-transformed) were best predicted by the presence of deep nuclei microinfarcts (Î²Â±SE=0.53Â±0.21, P=0.016), whereas hippocampal volume was significantly decreased in the presence of hippocampal sclerosis (Î²Â±SE=-1.23Â±0.30, P<0.001). This study showed that volumetric MRI measures correlated with postmortem Alzheimer-related and cerebrovascular neuropathology in this community-derived cohort, confirming that these MRI measures are important antemortem surrogates for these dementia-related pathologies."

Here, we compare and contrast ENM-based reconstructions of LGM refugial locations with those resulting from the more traditional molecular genetic and phylogeographic predictions. We examined 20 North American terrestrial vertebrate species from different regions and with different range sizes for which refugia have been identified based on phylogeographic analyses, using ENM tools to make parallel predictions. We then assessed the correspondence between the two approaches based on spatial overlap and areal extent of the predicted refugia. In 14 of the 20 species, the predictions from ENM and predictions based on phylogeographic studies were significantly spatially correlated, suggesting that the two approaches to development of refugial maps are converging on a similar result. Our results confirm that ENM scenario exploration can provide a useful complement to molecular studies, offering a less subjective, spatially explicit hypothesis of past geographic patterns of distribution."
"SHERMAN, Jeffrey",Why Barack Obama Is Black,"We propose that hypodescent-the assignment of mixed-race individuals to a minority group-is an emergent feature of basic cognitive processes of learning and categorization. According to attention theory, minority groups are learned by attending to the features that distinguish them from previously learned majority groups. Selective attention creates a strong association between minority groups and their distinctive features, producing a tendency to see individuals who possess a mixture of majority- and minority-group traits as minority-group members. Two experiments on face categorization, using both naturally occurring and manipulated minority groups, support this view, suggesting that hypodescent need not be the product of racist or political motivations, but can be sufficiently explained by an individual's learning history."

As part of a multicenter. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of F in sickle cell patients (SCD) with vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). 73 children aged 9 to 15 yr, were enrolled (37 F; 36 P). In the trial, study medication was given as a continuous IV infusion with either F (150 mg/ ml) at 100 mg/kg x 1 hr plus 30 mg/kg/hr x 47 hr, or matching placebo (P). In the 1 endpoint of the study, length of crisis (LOC), the children showed a reduction in LOC when treated with F vs. P (127 hr vs. 148.6 h, p=0.010). In addition, the F-patients exhibited a 114% increase in the number who achieved crisis resolution within 168 hr (59.5% vs. 27.8%, p=0.009). The F-patients also showed decreases in duration of hospitalization, pain intensity and total analgesic use, but these were not statistically significant. In addition, the incidence of AEs judged by investigators as acute chest syndrome or pneumonia were reduced by 42% (4 vs. 7) and 60% (2 vs. 5), respectively, in the Fpatients. F was generally well tolerated during the study but in some patients LFTs were transiently elevated with return to baseline during the hospitalization period. F had a slightly higher incidence of LFT elevations than P (14% vs 11%). No clinically significant renal function abnormalities were observed. Mild, transient thrombocytopenia was observed in 27% of F-pediatric patients vs. 22% on P. In a related study SCD patients with VOC were enrolled in an open-label, repeat administration safety study using the same dosing regimen as described above. The study enrolled 28 patients aged 7 to 39 yr, with 11 patients aged 7 to 15 yr. These 11 patients had 26 exposures to treatment, with 4 patients having 3 or more treatments within 1 yr. Only one of the pÃ©diatrie patients experienced an SAE, fever and sepsis, and it was judged unrelated to F. There was no obvious increase in the incidence of hepatic, renal or platelet abnormalities with repeat treatment with F. Overall, F was effective and well tolerated when administered by continuous IV infusion to pÃ©diatrie SCD patients. We feel these data justify conduct of a definitive study to validate the benefit of F in pÃ©diatrie SCD patients experiencing VOC."

To facilitate the development of the model, a base material model to describe the primary cyclic stress-strain relationships of reinforcing steel was developed. Available concepts to initiate bar buckling are utilized to develop a generic phenomenological material model and implemented in the computational platform, OpenSees. To evaluate the effectiveness of the new reinforcing bar model, the cyclic response of a model RC bridge column was simulated and compared to available experimental data. Preliminary findings suggest that the proposed model is effective in reproducing cyclic degrading behavior in RC bridge columns. Additional work is underway to improve the predictive capabilities of the model based on experimental data."

Our patient reported a 9-month history of progressive bilateral lower extremity erythema, swelling, erosions, and nail dystrophy that failed to improve despite multiple courses of antibiotics for presumed lower extremity cellulitis. Serum studies revealed zinc deficiency. This case supports the association of NAE with both HCV infection and zinc deficiency and highlights the pitfalls in the diagnosis of chronic unrecognized NAE. Suspected cases of NAE should prompt evaluation for underlying HCV and zinc deficiency to avoid treatment delay and associated complications."

"HELL, Johannes W",CaMKII binding to GluN2B is important for massed spatial learning in the Morris water maze,"Learning and memory as well as long-term potentiation (LTP) depend on Ca (2+) influx through the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) and the resulting activation of the Ca (2+) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII). Ca (2+) influx via the NMDAR triggers CaMKII binding to the NMDAR for enhanced CaMKII accumulation at post-synaptic sites that experience heightened activity as occurring during LTP. Previously, we generated knock-in (KI) mice in which we replaced two residues in the NMDAR GluN2B subunit to impair CaMKII binding to GluN2B. Various forms of LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapses in CA1 are reduced by 50%. Nevertheless, working memory in the win-shift 8 arm maze and learning of the Morris water maze (MWM) task was normal in the KI mice although recall of the task was impaired in these mice during the period of early memory consolidation. We now show that massed training in the MWM task within a single day resulted in impaired learning. However, learning and recall of the Barnes maze task and contextual fear conditioning over one or multiple days were surprisingly unaffected. The differences observed in the MWM compared to the Barnes maze and contextual fear conditioning suggest a differential involvement of CaMKII and the specific interaction with GluN2B, probably depending on varying degrees of stress, cognitive demand or even potentially different plasticity mechanisms associated with the diverse tasks."

The increase in dry season soil temperatures also served to increase NEE by drving up soil respiration. The changing precipitation patterns have an impact on carbon sequestration and other old-growth ecosystems. The results show that the ACASA was able to capture main features of the diurnal cycle of NEE as well as seasonal and interannual variations.

"BALLARD, Heidi L",Investing in citizen science can improve natural resource management and environmental protection,"Citizen science has made substantive contributions to science for hundreds of years. More recently, it has contributed to many articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals and has influenced natural resource management and environmental protection decisions and policies across the nation. Over the last 10 years, citizen scienceâ€”participation by the public in a scientific projectâ€”has seen explosive growth in the United States and many other countries, particularly in ecology, the environmental sciences, and related fields of inquiry. The goal of this report is to help government agencies and other organizations involved in natural resource management, environmental protection, and policymaking related to both to make informed decisions about investing in citizen science. In this report, we explore the current use of citizen science in natural resource and environmental science and decisionmaking in the United States and describe the investments organizations might make to benefit from citizen science. We find that: â€¢ Many people are interested in participating in citizen science. â€¢ Citizen science already contributes to natural resource and environmental science, natural resource management, and environmental protection and policymaking. â€¢ Citizen science is a rigorous process of scientific discovery, indistinguishable from conventional science apart from the participation of volunteers, and should be treated as such in its design, implementation, and evaluation. When properly designed and used, citizen science can help an organization meet its needs for sound science. â€¢ Citizen science can contribute to natural resource and environmental organizationsâ€™ goals for public input and engagement. â€¢ Many types of projects can benefit from citizen science. When planning to utilize citizen science, organizations need to match their needs and goals for science and public input and engagement to the strengths of particular citizen science projects and the ways in which the public can participate. Depending on the organizationâ€™s needs and goals, citizen science can efficiently generate high-quality data or help solve problems while fostering public input and engagement. â€¢ Organizational leadership is needed to provide realistic expectations for citizen science, including its limitations as well as its benefits. Leadership is also sometimes needed to lessen administrative hurdles and to create a safe space for learning from project inefficiencies and failures. Citizen science requires strategic investments. Beyond project-specific investments, organizations should consider developing or modifying policies and technologies designed to facilitate the field of citizen science as a whole."

It provides the energy that drives all biotic processes, including the trophic webs that sustain animal populations and the activity of decomposer organisms that recycle the nutrients required to support primary production. NPP not only sets the baseline for the functioning of all ecosystem components but also is the best summary variable of ecosystem processes, being the result of numerous interactions among elements, organisms, and environment. This dual role makes NPP the key integrative process in ecosystems (McNaughton et al., 1989), and thus a critical component in our understanding of ecosystem responses to the many changes that are occurring in the global environment. In this chapter, we explain the mechanisms that control NPP, including the environmental constraints on plant growth and the ways in which plants adjust to and alter these constraints."

While early stem cell transplantation therapies have been fraught with technical and political concerns as well as limited clinical benefits, mesenchymal stem cell therapies have been shown to be clinically beneficial and derivable from nonembryonic, adult sources.

"NOLTA, Jan A",Leaky ribosomal scanning in mammalian genomes: significance of histone H4 alternative translation in vivo,"Like alternative splicing, leaky ribosomal scanning (LRS), which occurs at suboptimal translational initiation codons, increases the physiological flexibility of the genome by allowing alternative translation. Comprehensive analysis of 22 208 human mRNAs indicates that, although the most important positions relative to the first nucleotide of the initiation codon, -3 and +4, are usually such that support initiation (A-3 = 42%, G-3 = 36% and G+4 = 47%), only 37.4% of the genes adhere to the purine (R)-3/G+4 rule at both positions simultaneously, suggesting that LRS may occur in some of the remaining (62.6%) genes. Moreover, 12.5% of the genes lack both R-3 and G+4, potentially leading to sLRS. Compared with 11 genes known to undergo LRS, 10 genes with experimental evidence for high fidelity A+1T+2G+3 initiation codons adhered much more strongly to the R-3/G+4 rule. Among the intron-less histone genes, only the H3 genes adhere to the R-3/G+4 rule, while the H1, H2A, H2B and H4 genes usually lack either R-3 or G+4. To address in vivo the significance of the previously described LRS of H4 mRNAs, which results in alternative translation of the osteogenic growth peptide, transgenic mice were engineered that ubiquitously and constitutively express a mutant H4 mRNA with an A+1T+1 mutation. These transgenic mice, in particular the females, have a high bone mass phenotype, attributable to increased bone formation. These data suggest that many genes may fulfill cryptic functions by LRS."

Anecdotal reports have suggested that memantine may improve neurologic and cognitive symptoms of individuals with the neurodegenerative disease fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS); however, its efficacy and safety in this population have not been assessed in a controlled trial. Method: Individuals with FXTAS aged 34-80 years were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1-year trial between September 2007 and August 2012. Inclusion required definite, probable, or possible FXTAS in clinical stages 1 -5 according to previously published criteria. Primary outcome measures were the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale (BDS) score and CATSYS intention tremor severity. Results: Ninety-four participants were randomized from 205 screened; of those, 43 and 45 started treatment with memantine (titrated to 10 mg twice daily) and placebo, respectively.Thirty-four participants receiving memantine and 36 receiving placebo completed the 1-yearendpoint assessment (n = 70). Intention-to-treat analysis showed no improvement with respect to intention tremor severity (mean [SD] values with memantine vs placebo: 1.05 [0.73] vs 1.89 [2.19], P=.O47) or BDS score (16.12 [5.43] vs 15.72 [3.93], P=.727) at follow-up. Post hoc analyses of participants with early FXTAS (stage < 3), those with late FXTAS (stage > 3), and those in different age groups (<65 years and >65 years) also indicated no significant improvement. More frequent mild adverse events were observed in the placebo group, while more frequent moderate adverse events occurred in the memantine group (P=.OO7). Conclusion:This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of memantine for individuals with FXTAS showed no benefit com pa red to placebo with respect to the selected outcome measures.

"SCHREIBER, Sebastian",Persistence in fluctuating environments for interacting structured populations,"Individuals within any species exhibit differences in size, developmental state, or spatial location. These differences coupled with environmental fluctuations in demographic rates can have subtle effects on population persistence and species coexistence. To understand these effects, we provide a general theory for coexistence of structured, interacting species living in a stochastic environment. The theory is applicable to nonlinear, multi species matrix models with stochastically varying parameters. The theory relies on long-term growth rates of species corresponding to the dominant Lyapunov exponents of random matrix products. Our coexistence criterion requires that a convex combination of these long-term growth rates is positive with probability one whenever one or more species are at low density. When this condition holds, the community is stochastically persistent: the fraction of time that a species density goes below (formula presented) approaches zero as (formula presented) approaches zero. Applications to predator-prey interactions in an autocorrelated environment, a stochastic LPA model, and spatial lottery models are provided. These applications demonstrate that positive autocorrelations in temporal fluctuations can disrupt predator-prey coexistence, fluctuations in log-fecundity can facilitate persistence in structured populations, and long-lived, relatively sedentary competing populations are likely to coexist in spatially and temporally heterogenous environments."

"MIENALTOWSKI, Michael J",Regulation of corneal stroma extracellular matrix assembly,"The transparent cornea is the major refractive element of the eye. A finely controlled assembly of the stromal extracellular matrix is critical to corneal function, as well as in establishing the appropriate mechanical stability required to maintain corneal shape and curvature. In the stroma, homogeneous, small diameter collagen fibrils, regularly packed with a highly ordered hierarchical organization, are essential for function. This review focuses on corneal stroma assembly and the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis. Corneal collagen fibrillogenesis involves multiple molecules interacting in sequential steps, as well as interactions between keratocytes and stroma matrix components. The stroma has the highest collagen V:I ratio in the body. Collagen V regulates the nucleation of protofibril assembly, thus controlling the number of fibrils and assembly of smaller diameter fibrils in the stroma. The corneal stroma is also enriched in small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) that cooperate in a temporal and spatial manner to regulate linear and lateral collagen fibril growth. In addition, the fibril-associated collagens (FACITs) such as collagen XII and collagen XIV have roles in the regulation of fibril packing and inter-lamellar interactions. A communicating keratocyte network contributes to the overall and long-range regulation of stromal extracellular matrix assembly, by creating micro-domains where the sequential steps in stromal matrix assembly are controlled. Keratocytes control the synthesis of extracellular matrix components, which interact with the keratocytes dynamically to coordinate the regulatory steps into a cohesive process. Mutations or deficiencies in stromal regulatory molecules result in altered interactions and deficiencies in both transparency and refraction, leading to corneal stroma pathobiology such as stromal dystrophies, cornea plana and keratoconus."

"SAEIJ, Jeroen",Determinants of GBP Recruitment to Toxoplasma gondii Vacuoles and the Parasitic Factors That Control It,"IFN-Î³ is a major cytokine that mediates resistance against the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The p65 guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) are strongly induced by IFN-Î³. We studied the behavior of murine GBP1 (mGBP1) upon infection with T. gondii in vitro and confirmed that IFN-Î³-dependent re-localization of mGBP1 to the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) correlates with the virulence type of the parasite. We identified three parasitic factors, ROP16, ROP18, and GRA15 that determine strain-specific accumulation of mGBP1 on the PV. These highly polymorphic proteins are held responsible for a large part of the strain-specific differences in virulence. Therefore, our data suggest that virulence of T. gondii in animals may rely in part on recognition by GBPs. However, phagosomes or vacuoles containing Trypanosoma cruzi did not recruit mGBP1. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed mGBP2, mGBP4, and mGBP5 as binding partners of mGBP1. Indeed, mGBP2 and mGBP5 co-localize with mGBP1 in T. gondii-infected cells. T. gondii thus elicits a cell-autonomous immune response in mice with GBPs involved. Three parasitic virulence factors and unknown IFN-Î³-dependent host factors regulate this complex process. Depending on the virulence of the strains involved, numerous GBPs are brought to the PV as part of a large, multimeric structure to combat T. gondii."

"HARVEY, John T",Calibration of Incremental-Recursive Flexible Damage Models in CalME Using HVS Experiments,"Caltrans is in the process of implementing Mechanistic-Empirical design procedures. All mechanisticempirical methods must be validated/calibrated against the behavior of real pavements. This should be done before implementing models in design methods to ensure that designs will be reasonable. The Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS) provides a first step in this validation/calibration process. The short test section can be carefully constructed with well characterized materials and instrumented to measure the pavement response. The climatic conditions may be controlled or monitored closely and all load applications are known exactly. The pavement may also be tested until it fails. The HVS may be seen as â€œlarge scaleâ€ laboratory equipment, between the â€œsmall scaleâ€ laboratory equipment (triaxial tests, bending tests etc.) and the reality of real pavements, which have uncertainties regarding materials, loads and climatic conditions. The two HVSs owned by Caltrans have been used on 27 flexible pavement test sections, with varying combinations of asphalt and granular layers. Temperature control was used during the tests. Most sections have been instrumented with Multi-depth Deflectometers (MDDs) to compare the measured pavement deflections (at several depths) to the deflections predicted by mechanistic methods, during the full duration of tests carried to â€œfailureâ€ (in terms of rutting or cracking). Results from mechanistic models have been compared with the deflection measurements and performance as a first step prior to empirical calibrations with field results. The complete time history of each test has been compared rather than just the beginning and end measurements. This report presents the validation of the mechanistic models for asphalt fatigue and for permanent deformation with the HVS test results."
"ALBERTSON, Timothy E",The Changing Use of Intravenous Opioids in an Emergency Department,"Introduction: Government agencies are increasingly emphasizing opioid safety in hospitals. In 2012, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) started a sentinel event program, the â€œSafe Use of Opioids in Hospitals.â€ We sought to determine if opioid use patterns in our emergency department (ED) changed from 2011, before the program began, to 2013, after start of the program.
      Methods: This was a retrospective study of all adult ED patients who received an intravenous opioid and had a serum creatinine measured. We recorded opioids used, dose prescribed, and serum creatinine. As an index of the safety of opioids, uses of naloxone after administration of an opioid was recorded.Results: Morphine is still the most commonly used opioid by doses given, but its percentage of opioids used decreased from 68.9% in 2011 to 52.8% in 2013. During the same period, use of hydromorphone increased from 27.5% to 42.9%, while the use of fentanyl changed little (3.6% to 4.3%). Naloxone administration was rare after an opioid had been given. Opioids were not dosed in an equipotent manner.Conclusion: The use of hydromorphone in our ED increased by 56% (absolute increase of 15.4%), while the use of morphine decreased by 30.5% (absolute decrease 16.1%) of total opioid use from 2011 to 2013. The JCAHO program likely was at least indirectly responsible for this change in relative dosing of the opioids. Based on frequency of naloxone administered after administration of an opioid, the use of opioids was safe."
"TAL, Gil",Childrenâ€™s Bicycling to After-School Activities: The Case of the Davis AYSO Bike-to-Soccer Program,"In recent years, transportation planners have devoted more attention to the goal of increasing the non-motorized trips of children and adults. Non-motorized trips are considered important as a mean of reducing motorized trips as well increasing physical activity. Indeed, lack of physical activity has been identified as a major public health problem for both adults and younger people (Center of Disease control (CDC), 2005; Sallis, et al., 2004). A CDC report from 2002, for example, reports that about a third of the teenagers are not physically active enough (CDC, 2002). The lack of physical activity among children is, in part, associated with travel behavior and urban form (Ewing et al, 2003, Handy et al, 2002; Martin-Diener et al, 2005): children living in auto-oriented areas in the U.S. use walking and biking as modes of transportation to nearby destinations to a limited extent and less than in the past (Sallis et al, 1993; Sallis et al 2000). Their high level of auto use is, of course, tied to a high level of auto use among their parents, particularly their mothers (McMillan, 2007).For children, much discussion has focused on the journey to school, though researchers are now addressing non-school travel as well. According to McDonald (2006), who studied childrenâ€™s travel patterns based on the National Household Travel Survey, only 12% of the trips to sport activities are made by bike. The NHTS data do not allow a full estimate of non-motorized trips taken alone, versus trips taken with a parent, but it is reasonable to assume that use of bikes is even lower when parents are involved in the trip. Copperman and Bhat (2007) analyzed the determinants of childrenâ€™s weekend physical activity participation using data from the 2000 Bay Area travel survey. Their models correlate socio-demographic and land use variables with active and passive travel (i.e. non-motorized and motorized) and with physically active and passive activities. Their findings suggest that children (ages 5 to 17) rarely use non-motorized modes to get to places where they engage in physical activities, and that individual and household demographics, along with environmental factors, affect the level of physical activity.One place where children might be expected to use non-motorized modes to get to after-school activities is Davis, CA, well-known as a bicycle-friendly community. In Fall 2006, the Davis chapter of the American Youth Soccer Organization (Davis AYSO) set out to increase bicycling to soccer games through a two-pronged approach. First, the organization adopted a new approach to scheduling games, spreading them to fields throughout Davis rather than scheduling as many games as possible at three centralized fields. For most games, at least one team (and often both) was scheduled for a field within their neighborhood. In addition, Davis AYSO undertook a promotional program to encourage families to bike to games, including distribution of â€œBike to AYSOâ€ bike stickers, the creation of a special web site that included a Davis Bike Map, and e-mail announcements to almost all families about the â€œBike to AYSOâ€ effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of this program in encouraging players and their families to bike more frequently, Davis AYSO worked with researchers at the University of California, Davis. This report describes the methods used in that effort and summarizes the results."
"BROWN, Patrick H",Development of leaf sampling and interpretation methods for Almond,"According to a survey of almond growers and consultants in California, leaf sampling and comparison of leaf nutrient concentrations with established critical values (CV) does not provide sufficient guidance for nutrient management. Two explanations for this observation are possible. 1) The current CVs are incorrect or not useful for the decision making process due to lack of sensitivity or inappropriate timing. 2) There are systematic errors in the manner in which critical values are used. The goal of this research is to conduct a systematic examination of leaf sampling protocols and their use in decision making. Preliminary data indicate that leaves from spurs with local fruit load seem to be more suitable for assessing plant nutritional status than leaves from spurs without local fruit load. In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that the death of loaded spurs may be attributable to a local nutrient deficit through out the season."
"SPERLING, Daniel",Toward Effective Transportation Policy,"For those concerned about energy use and greenhouse gases in the transport sector, virtually all trends are in the wrong direction -- in the US as well as in most other countries of the world:â€¢Transit market share continues to drop, now accounting for less than 2% of passenger travel in the US;â€¢vehicle use and ownership continues to set new records every year, with each licensed driver in the US now owning 1.1 vehicles and driving over 14,000 miles per year on average;â€¢vehicles are getting larger and heavier every year;â€¢fuel economy of new vehicles is worsening and is now at its lowest level in the US since the early 1980s;â€¢GHG emissions from transportation are increasing at 2% per year in the US and at similar or higher rates in virtually all countries with expanding economies;â€¢transportation accounts for an increasing share of increasing CO2 emissions virtually everywhere (increasing from 16.9% of worldwide total in 1971 to over 20% today).These trends are disturbing, but not unchangeable. Indeed, the potential for energy saving and greenhouse gas reduction in transportation is huge. The many strategies for doing so may be clustered into three groups:â€¢reduce vehicle travel;â€¢improve conventional vehicle technology; andâ€¢introduce advanced technologies and low-carbon fuels.All three are important. The first, reductions in vehicle travel, are desirable for a variety of reasons, and certainly merit strong support. But in terms of GHG reductions, technology-based strategies (the 2nd and 3rd strategies) are likely to be far more effective, especially in the US and probably in all OECD countries. Very large reductions are possible with improvements in conventional vehicle technology, and even greater reductions are possible with emerging electric-drive technologies and low-carbon fuels."

"HARSH, Griffith R",Computational Identification of Tumor Anatomic Location Associated with Survival in 2 Large Cohorts of Human Primary Glioblastomas,"Background and purposeTumor location has been shown to be a significant prognostic factor in patients with glioblastoma. The purpose of this study was to characterize glioblastoma lesions by identifying MR imaging voxel-based tumor location features that are associated with tumor molecular profiles, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes.Materials and methodsPreoperative T1 anatomic MR images of 384 patients with glioblastomas were obtained from 2 independent cohorts (n = 253 from the Stanford University Medical Center for training and n = 131 from The Cancer Genome Atlas for validation). An automated computational image-analysis pipeline was developed to determine the anatomic locations of tumor in each patient. Voxel-based differences in tumor location between good (overall survival of >17 months) and poor (overall survival of <11 months) survival groups identified in the training cohort were used to classify patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort into 2 brain-location groups, for which clinical features, messenger RNA expression, and copy number changes were compared to elucidate the biologic basis of tumors located in different brain regions.ResultsTumors in the right occipitotemporal periventricular white matter were significantly associated with poor survival in both training and test cohorts (both, log-rank P < .05) and had larger tumor volume compared with tumors in other locations. Tumors in the right periatrial location were associated with hypoxia pathway enrichment and PDGFRA amplification, making them potential targets for subgroup-specific therapies.ConclusionsVoxel-based location in glioblastoma is associated with patient outcome and may have a potential role for guiding personalized treatment."

"SEYAL, Masud",Postictal immobility and generalized EEG suppression are associated with the severity of respiratory dysfunction,"ObjectiveThe pathophysiology of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) remains undetermined. Seizures are accompanied by respiratory dysfunction (RD). Postictal generalized electroencephalography (EEG) suppression (PGES) may follow generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). Following GTCS patients have impaired arousal and may be motionless. Patients with SUDEP are usually prone. Postictal immobility (PI) may contribute to SUDEP by not permitting repositioning of the head to allow unimpeded ventilation. To determine whether RD and/or ictal characteristics are associated with PI, we analyzed patients with GTCS in the epilepsy monitoring unit.MethodWe investigated for associations between PI duration and PGES, ictal/postictal oxygen saturation (SpO2 ), end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2 ), seizure localization, duration, and tonic and total convulsive phase duration. We investigated for linkage between PGES and these measures.ResultsSeventy patients with 181 GTCS and available SpO2 and/or ETCO2 data were studied. Simple linear regression analysis by seizures showed that PI duration was associated with peak periictal ETCO2 (p = 0.03), duration of oxygen desaturation (p = 0.005) and with SpO2 nadir (p = 0.02). PI duration was not associated with tonic, convulsive phase or total seizure duration. Analysis by patients also showed significant association of PI with RD. Duration of PI was longer following seizures with PGES (p < 0.001). PGES was not associated with the tonic, convulsive phase or total seizure duration. SpO2 nadir was lower in seizures with PGES (p = 0.046), ETCO2 peak change (p = 0.003) was higher, and duration of ETCO2 elevation (p = 0.03) was longer. Multivariable regression analysis showed that PGES and severe RD were associated with PI duration.SignificanceThe duration of PI and presence of PGES are associated with periictal RD. The duration of PI is also associated with the presence of PGES. Seizure duration or duration of the convulsive phase is not associated with PI or PGES. Interventions aimed at reversing impaired arousal and PI may reduce SUDEP risk."

Signalment, concurrent ophthalmic diagnoses, previous therapies, diagnostic tests, systemic diagnoses, treatment, follow-up, and outcomes were compared between horses diagnosed with CD or CBK. Age, breed, and gender were compared between the CD/CBK and UCD-VMTH populations.ResultsThirty-three horses (42 eyes) and 36 horses (45 eyes) were diagnosed with CD and CBK, respectively. Horses with CD or CBK were significantly older (P < 0.001) than the UCD-VMTH population with a median age of 16 or 18 years, respectively. Appaloosas were significantly overrepresented in the CD/CBK population (33%) in comparison with the UCD-VMTH population (1.8%, P < 0.001). Equine recurrent uveitis was concurrently diagnosed in 67% and 84% of horses with CD or CBK, respectively. Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) was diagnosed significantly less often in horses with CD vs. CBK (P = 0.03). Chemical chelation with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was performed significantly less frequently in horses diagnosed with CD (7.1%) vs. CBK (31.1% of eyes) (P = 0.012).ConclusionsDespite some differences, equine CD and CBK are relatively similar conditions and may represent a continuum of disease severity. Horses with PPID should be monitored closely for corneal disease including CBK."

"ROGAWSKI, Michael A",Evaluation of the neuroactive steroid ganaxolone on social and repetitive behaviors in the BTBR mouse model of autism,"RationaleAbnormalities in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission are hypothesized to contribute to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) etiology. BTBR T (+) Itpr3 (tf) /J (BTBR), an inbred mouse strain, displays social deficits and repetitive self-grooming, offering face validity to ASD diagnostic symptoms. Reduced GABAergic neurotransmission in BTBR suggests that GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) could improve ASD-relevant BTBR phenotypes. The neuroactive steroid ganaxolone acts as a PAM, displaying anticonvulsant properties in rodent epilepsy models and an anxiolytic-like profile in the elevated plus-maze.ObjectivesWe evaluated ganaxolone in BTBR and C57BL/6J mice in standardized assays for sociability and repetitive behaviors. Open field and anxiety-related behaviors were tested as internal controls and for comparison with the existing neuroactive steroid literature.ResultsGanaxolone improved aspects of social approach and reciprocal social interactions in BTBR, with no effect on repetitive self-grooming, and no detrimental effects in C57BL/6J. Ganaxolone increased overall exploratory activity in BTBR and C57BL/6J in the open field, social approach, and elevated plus-maze, introducing a confound for the interpretation of social improvements. Allopregnanolone and diazepam similarly increased total entries in the elevated plus-maze, indicating that behavioral activation may be a general property of GABAA receptor PAMs in these strains.ConclusionsGanaxolone shows promise for improving sociability. In addition, ganaxolone, as well as other GABAA receptor PAMs, enhanced overall BTBR activity. The translational implications of specific sociability improvements and nonspecific behavioral activation by ganaxolone in the BTBR model remain to be determined. Future studies to explore whether PAMs provide a novel profile with unique benefits for ASD treatment will be worthwhile."
"THOMASY, Sara M",Species Differences in the Geometry of the Anterior Segment Differentially Affect Anterior Chamber Cell Scoring Systems in Laboratory Animals,"PurposeTo determine the impact of anterior segment geometry on ocular scoring systems quantifying anterior chamber (AC) cells in humans and 7 common laboratory species.MethodsUsing normative anterior segment dimensions and novel geometric formulae, ocular section volumes measured by 3 scoring systems; Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN), Ocular Services On Demand (OSOD), and OSOD-modified SUN were calculated for each species, respectively. Calculated volumes were applied to each system's AC cell scoring scheme to determine comparative cell density (cells/mm(3)). Cell density values for all laboratory species were normalized to human values and conversion factors derived to create modified scoring schemes, facilitating interspecies comparison with each system, respectively.ResultsDifferences in anterior segment geometry resulted in marked differences in optical section volume measured. Volumes were smaller in rodents than dogs and cats, but represented a comparatively larger percentage of AC volume. AC cell density (cells/mm(3)) varied between species. Using the SUN and OSOD-modified SUN systems, values in the pig, dog, and cat underestimated human values; values in rodents overestimated human values. Modified normalized scoring systems presented here account for species-related anterior segment geometry and facilitate both intra- and interspecies analysis, as well as translational comparison.ConclusionsEmployment of modified AC cell scoring systems that account for species-specific differences in anterior segment anatomy would harmonize findings across species and may be more predictive for determining ocular toxicological consequences in ocular drug and device development programs."

Young adult rats were subjected to a temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham operation. A polyethylene glycol-liposome-based transfection system was used to administer a miR-122 mimic after MCAO. Neurological deficits, brain infarction, brain vessel integrity, adhesion molecule expression and expression of miR-122 target and indirect-target genes were examined in blood at 24â€‰h after MCAO with or without miR-122 treatment. miR-122 decreased in blood after MCAO, whereas miR-122 mimic elevated miR-122 in blood 24â€‰h after MCAO. Intravenous but not intracerebroventricular injection of miR-122 mimic decreased neurological deficits and brain infarction, attenuated ICAM-1 expression, and maintained vessel integrity after MCAO. The miR-122 mimic also down-regulated direct target genes (e.g. Vcam1, Nos2, Pla2g2a) and indirect target genes (e.g. Alox5, Itga2b, Timp3, Il1b, Il2, Mmp8) in blood after MCAO which are predicted to affect cell adhesion, diapedesis, leukocyte extravasation, eicosanoid and atherosclerosis signaling. The data show that elevating miR-122 improves stroke outcomes and we postulate this occurs via downregulating miR-122 target genes in blood leukocytes."

"GUYER, Amanda E",Social re-orientation and brain development: An expanded and updated view,"Social development has been the focus of a great deal of neuroscience based research over the past decade. In this review, we focus on providing a framework for understanding how changes in facets of social development may correspond with changes in brain function. We argue that (1) distinct phases of social behavior emerge based on whether the organizing social force is the mother, peer play, peer integration, or romantic intimacy; (2) each phase is marked by a high degree of affect-driven motivation that elicits a distinct response in subcortical structures; (3) activity generated by these structures interacts with circuits in prefrontal cortex that guide executive functions, and occipital and temporal lobe circuits, which generate specific sensory and perceptual social representations. We propose that the direction, magnitude and duration of interaction among these affective, executive, and perceptual systems may relate to distinct sensitive periods across development that contribute to establishing long-term patterns of brain function and behavior."

"NAVEDO, Manuel F",AKAP150 participates in calcineurin/NFAT activation during the down-regulation of voltage-gated K+ currents in ventricular myocytes following myocardial infarction,The Ca(2+)-responsive phosphatase calcineurin/protein phosphatase 2B dephosphorylates the transcription factor NFATc3. In the myocardium activation of NFATc3 down-regulates the expression of voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels after myocardial infarction (MI). This prolongs action potential duration and increases the probability of arrhythmias. Although recent studies infer that calcineurin is activated by local and transient Ca(2+) signals the molecular mechanism that underlies the process is unclear in ventricular myocytes. Here we test the hypothesis that sequestering of calcineurin to the sarcolemma of ventricular myocytes by the anchoring protein AKAP150 is required for acute activation of NFATc3 and the concomitant down-regulation of Kv channels following MI. Biochemical and cell based measurements resolve that approximately 0.2% of the total calcineurin activity in cardiomyocytes is associated with AKAP150. Electrophysiological analyses establish that formation of this AKAP150-calcineurin signaling dyad is essential for the activation of the phosphatase and the subsequent down-regulation of Kv channel currents following MI. Thus AKAP150-mediated targeting of calcineurin to sarcolemmal micro-domains in ventricular myocytes contributes to the local and acute gene remodeling events that lead to the down-regulation of Kv currents.

By field cooling in magnetic fields of opposite directions, the resultant hysteresis loop consists of two loops shifted in opposite directions from the zero magnetic field. The NiFe layers are in the antiparallel state in zero magnetic field, and the switching to the parallel state can be tuned by varying the exchange bias. The modified spin valves also show potential for suppressed Barkhausen noise."

Engineered virus-like nanoparticles were then covalently conjugated to a breast cancer recognized ligand, LXY30 and an amine-coupled near-infrared fluorescence dye.ResultsLXY30-HEV VLP was checked for its binding and entry to a breast cancer cell line and for tumor targeting in vivo to breast cancer tissue in mice. The engineered virus-like nanoparticle not only targeted cancer cells, but also appeared immune silent to native hepatitis E virus antibodies due to epitope disruption at the antibody-binding site.ConclusionThese results demonstrate the production of a theranostic capsule suitable for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics based on surface modification of a highly stable virus-like nanoparticle."

The model differentiated between adsorption of solute molecules in the bulk and surface of solution using the statistical mechanics of multilayer sorption solution model of Dutcher et al. (J. Phys.

In the current work, these parameters are related to solute molecular properties in aqueous solutions. For nonelectrolytes, sorption tendencies suggest a strong relation with molecular size and functional group spacing. For electrolytes, surface adsorption of ions follows ion surface-bulk partitioning calculations by Pegram and Record (J. Phys. Chem. B 2007, 111, 5411-5417)."

"LEUNG, Patrick S",Chemokine and chemokine receptors in autoimmunity: the case of primary biliary cholangitis.,"Chemokines represent a major mediator of innate immunity and play a key role in the selective recruitment of cells during localized inflammatory responses. Beyond critical extracellular mediators of leukocyte trafficking, chemokines and their cognate receptors are expressed by a variety of resident and infiltrating cells (monocytes, lymphocytes, NK cells, mast cells, and NKT cells). Chemokines represent ideal candidates for mechanistic studies (particularly in murine models) to better understand the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and possibly become biomarkers of disease. Nonetheless, therapeutic approaches targeting chemokines have led to unsatisfactory results in rheumatoid arthritis, while biologics against pro-inflammatory cytokines are being used worldwide with success. In this comprehensive review we will discuss the evidence supporting the involvement of chemokines and their specific receptors in mediating the effector cell response, utilizing the autoimmune/primary biliary cholangitis setting as a paradigm."

In the present study, we analyzed gamma oscillations of pulvinar neurons in the monkeys during a delayed non-matching to sample task, in which monkeys were required to discriminate 4 categories of visual stimuli (snakes, monkey faces, monkey hands and simple geometrical patterns). Gamma oscillations of pulvinar neuronal activity were analyzed in three phases around the stimulus onset (Pre-stimulus: 500â€‰ms before stimulus onset; Early: 0-200â€‰ms after stimulus onset; and Late: 300-500â€‰ms after stimulus onset). The results showed significant increases in mean strength of gamma oscillations in the Early phase for snakes and the Late phase for monkey faces, but no significant differences in ratios and frequencies of gamma oscillations among the 3 phases. The different periods of stronger gamma oscillations provide neurophysiological evidence that is consistent with other studies indicating that primates can detect snakes very rapidly and also cue in to faces for information. Our results are suggestive of different roles of gamma oscillations in the pulvinar: feedforward processing for images of snakes and cortico-pulvinar-cortical integration for images of faces."
"DAHLKE, Helen",Using concurrent DNA tracer injections to infer glacial flow pathways,"Catchment hydrology has become replete with flow pathway characterizations obtained via combinations of physical hydrologic measurements (e.g. streamflow hydrographs) and natural tracer signals (e.g. stable water isotopes and geochemistry). In this study, we explored how our understanding of hydrologic flow pathways can be improved and expanded in both space and time by the simultaneous application of engineered synthetic DNA tracers. In this study, we compared the advective-dispersive transport properties and mass recovery rates of two types of synthetic DNA tracers, one consisting of synthetic DNA strands encapsulated into biodegradable microspheres and another consisting of 'free' DNA, i.e. not encapsulated. The DNA tracers were also compared with a conservative fluorescent dye. All tracers were injected into a small (3.2-km2) valley glacier, StorglaciÃ¤ren, in northern Sweden. Seven of the nine DNA tracers showed clear recovery during the sampling period and similar peak arrival times and dispersion coefficients as the conservative fluorescent dye. However, recovered DNA tracer mass ranged only from 1% to 66%, while recovered fluorescent dye mass was 99%. Resulting from the cold and opaque subglacial environment provided by the glacier, mass loss associated with microbial activity and photochemical degradation of the DNA is likely negligible, leaving sorption of DNA tracers onto suspended particles and loss of microtracer particles to sediment storage as probable explanations. Despite the difference in mass recovery, the advection and dispersion information derived from the DNA tracer breakthrough curves provided spatially explicit information that allowed inferring a theoretical model of the flow pathways that water takes through the glacier."
"SRINIVASAN, Vivek J",Interferometric Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (iNIRS) for determination of optical and dynamical properties of turbid media,"We introduce and implement interferometric near-infrared spectroscopy (iNIRS), which simultaneously extracts optical and dynamical properties of turbid media through analysis of a spectral interference fringe pattern. The spectral interference fringe pattern is measured using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a frequency-swept narrow linewidth laser. Fourier analysis of the detected signal is used to determine time-of-flight (TOF)-resolved intensity, which is then analyzed over time to yield TOF-resolved intensity autocorrelations. This approach enables quantification of optical properties, which is not possible in conventional, continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Furthermore, iNIRS quantifies scatterer motion based on TOF-resolved autocorrelations, which is a feature inaccessible by well-established diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) techniques. We prove this by determining TOF-resolved intensity and temporal autocorrelations for light transmitted through diffusive fluid phantoms with optical thicknesses of up to 55 reduced mean free paths (approximately 120 scattering events). The TOF-resolved intensity is used to determine optical properties with time-resolved diffusion theory, while the TOF-resolved intensity autocorrelations are used to determine dynamics with diffusing wave spectroscopy. iNIRS advances the capabilities of diffuse optical methods and is suitable for in vivo tissue characterization. Moreover, iNIRS combines NIRS and DCS capabilities into a single modality."
"KEEGAN, Theresa H","Predictors of early death and survival among children, adolescents and young adults with acute myeloid leukaemia in California, 1988-2011: a population-based study.","A better understanding of factors associated with early death and survival among children, adolescents and young adults with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) may guide health policy aimed at improving outcomes in these patients. We examined trends in early death and survival among 3935 patients aged 0-39&nbsp;years with de novo AML in California during 1988-2011 and investigated the associations between sociodemographic and selected clinical factors and outcomes. Early death declined from 9Â·7% in 1988-1995 to 7Â·1% in 2004-2011 (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0Â·062), and survival improved substantially over time. However, 5-year survival was still only 50% (95% confidence interval 47-53%) even in the most recent treatment period (2004-2011). Overall, the main factors associated with poor outcomes were older age at diagnosis, treatment at hospitals not affiliated with National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centres, and black race/ethnicity. For patients diagnosed during 1996-2011, survival was lower among those who lacked health insurance compared to those with public or private insurance. We conclude that mortality after AML remained strikingly high in California and increased with age. Possible strategies to improve outcomes include wider insurance coverage and treatment at specialized cancer centres."

"YANG, Jun",Addition of DHA Synergistically Enhances the Efficacy of Regorafenib for Kidney Cancer Therapy,"Kidney cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and its incidence is increasing. The treatment of this malignancy took a major step forward with the recent introduction of targeted therapeutics, such as kinase inhibitors. Unfortunately, kinase inhibition is associated with the onset of resistance after 1 to 2 years of treatment. Regorafenib, like many multikinase inhibitors, was designed to block the activities of several key kinase pathways involved in oncogenesis (Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK) and tumor angiogenesis (VEGF-receptors), and we have recently shown that it also possesses soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitory activity, which may be contributing to its salutary effects in patients. Because sEH inhibition results in increases in the DHA-derived epoxydocosapentaenoic acids that we have previously described to possess anticancer properties, we asked whether the addition of DHA to a therapeutic regimen in the presence of regorafenib would enhance its beneficial effects in vivo We now show that the combination of regorafenib and DHA results in a synergistic effect upon tumor invasiveness as well as p-VEGFR attenuation. In addition, this combination showed a reduction in tumor weights, greater than each agent alone, in a mouse xenograft model of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC), yielding the expected oxylipin profiles; these data were supported in several RCC cell lines that showed similar results in vitro Because DHA is the predominant component of fish oil, our data suggest that this nontoxic dietary supplement could be administered with regorafenib during therapy for advanced RCC and could be the basis of a clinical trial.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a lipophilic statin, atorvastatin, on breast cancer biomarkers of risk [mammographic density (MD) and insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1)] in high-risk premenopausal women.Premenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer received either 40 mg of atorvastatin or placebo for 1 year. Biomarker assessment was performed prior to initiation and at completion of study medication. MD was determined using both Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System and the visual analogue scale. Serum IGF-1 was determined by ELISA assay at the end of the study.Sixty-three women were enrolled between December 2005 and May 2010. Sixteen (25%) women withdrew. The mean age of participants was 43 (range, 35-50), 100% were white, and the average body mass index (BMI) was 26.4. The statin group demonstrated a significant decrease in cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), suggesting compliance with study medication. After accounting for BMI, there was no difference in change in MD between groups. There was a significant increase in serum IGF-1 in the statin group.In this multi-institutional randomized prospective clinical trial of premenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer, we did not see an effect of atorvastatin on MD. Further investigation of statins may be warranted; however, design of prior trials and potential mechanism of action of the agent need to be considered in the design of future trials.

We aimed to determine whether specific types of mental disorders and increasing numbers of mental disorders were associated with the onset of arthritis later in life.MethodData were collected using face-to-face household surveys, conducted in 19 countries from different regions of the world (n=52,095). Lifetime prevalence and age at onset of 16 DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed retrospectively with the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI). Arthritis was assessed by self-report of lifetime history of arthritis and age at onset. Survival analyses estimated the association of initial onset of mental disorders with subsequent onset of arthritis.ResultsAfter adjusting for comorbidity, the number of mood, anxiety, impulse-control, and substance disorders remained significantly associated with arthritis onset showing odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.2 to 1.4. Additionally, the risk of developing arthritis increased as the number of mental disorders increased from one to five or more disorders.ConclusionThis study suggests links between mental disorders and subsequent arthritis onset using a large, multi-country dataset. These associations lend support to the idea that it may be possible to reduce the severity of mental disorder-arthritis comorbidity through early identification and effective treatment of mental disorders."
"CHERTOK, Maxwell B",Measurement of the forwardâ€“backward asymmetry of top-quark and antiquark pairs using the full CDF Run II data set,"We measure the forward-backward asymmetry of the production of top-quark and antiquark pairs in proton-antiproton collisions at center-of-mass energy s=1.96 TeV using the full data set collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) in Tevatron Run II corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.1 fb-1. The asymmetry is characterized by the rapidity difference between top quarks and antiquarks (Î”y) and measured in the final state with two charged leptons (electrons and muons). The inclusive asymmetry, corrected to the entire phase space at parton level, is measured to be AFBtt=0.12Â±0.13, consistent with the expectations from the standard model (SM) and previous CDF results in the final state with a single charged lepton. The combination of the CDF measurements of the inclusive AFBtt in both final states yields AFBtt=0.160Â±0.045, which is consistent with the SM predictions. We also measure the differential asymmetry as a function of Î”y. A linear fit to AFBtt(|Î”y|), assuming zero asymmetry at Î”y=0, yields a slope of Î±=0.14Â±0.15, consistent with the SM prediction and the previous CDF determination in the final state with a single charged lepton. The combined slope of AFBtt(|Î”y|) in the two final states is Î±=0.227Â±0.057, which is 2.0Ïƒ larger than the SM prediction."

Novel immunizing haptens were synthesized by derivatizing at the 4-Cl position of the TCS molecule. Compounds derived from substitutions at 4'-Cl and that replaced the 2'-OH with a Cl atom were designed as unique coating antigen haptens. Polyclonal rabbit antisera were screened against the coating antigen library to identify combinations of immunoreagents resulting in the most sensitive assays. The most sensitive assay identified was one utilizing antiserum no. 1155 and a heterologous competitive hapten, where the 2'-OH group was substituted with a Cl atom. An IC50 value and the detection range for TCS in assay buffer were 1.19 and 0.21-6.71 Î¼g/L, respectively. The assay was selective for TCS, providing low cross-reactivity (<5%) to the major metabolites of TCS and to brominated diphenyl ether-47. A second assay utilizing a competitive hapten containing Br instead of Cl substitutions was broadly selective for both brominated and chlorinated diphenylethers. Using the most sensitive assay combination, we measured TCS concentrations in water samples following dilution. Biosolid samples were analyzed following the dilution of a simple solvent extract. The immunoassay results were similar to those determined by LC-MS/MS. This immunoassay can be used as a rapid and convenient tool to screen for human and environmental exposure."

Although multiple antidepressants have been used in the treatment of depressive symptoms, their beneficial effects are limited. The soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) plays a key role in the inflammation that is involved in depression. Thus, we examined here the role of sEH in depression. In both inflammation and social defeat stress models of depression, a potent sEH inhibitor, TPPU, displayed rapid antidepressant effects. Expression of sEH protein in the brain from chronically stressed (susceptible) mice was higher than of control mice. Furthermore, expression of sEH protein in postmortem brain samples of patients with psychiatric diseases, including depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, was higher than controls. This finding suggests that increased sEH levels might be involved in the pathogenesis of certain psychiatric diseases. In support of this hypothesis, pretreatment with TPPU prevented the onset of depression-like behaviors after inflammation or repeated social defeat stress. Moreover, sEH KO mice did not show depression-like behavior after repeated social defeat stress, suggesting stress resilience. The sEH KO mice showed increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylation of its receptor TrkB in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, but not nucleus accumbens, suggesting that increased BDNF-TrkB signaling in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus confer stress resilience. All of these findings suggest that sEH plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depression, and that epoxy fatty acids, their mimics, as well as sEH inhibitors could be potential therapeutic or prophylactic drugs for depression."

"MILLS, David A",Oligosaccharides Released from Milk Glycoproteins Are Selective Growth Substrates for Infant-Associated Bifidobacteria,"UnlabelledMilk, in addition to nourishing the neonate, provides a range of complex glycans whose construction ensures a specific enrichment of key members of the gut microbiota in the nursing infant, a consortium known as the milk-oriented microbiome. Milk glycoproteins are thought to function similarly, as specific growth substrates for bifidobacteria common to the breast-fed infant gut. Recently, a cell wall-associated endo-Î²-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EndoBI-1) found in various infant-borne bifidobacteria was shown to remove a range of intact N-linked glycans. We hypothesized that these released oligosaccharide structures can serve as a sole source for the selective growth of bifidobacteria. We demonstrated that EndoBI-1 released N-glycans from concentrated bovine colostrum at the pilot scale. EndoBI-1-released N-glycans supported the rapid growth of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis), a species that grows well on human milk oligosaccharides, but did not support growth of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis), a species which does not. Conversely, B. infantis ATCC 15697 did not grow on the deglycosylated milk protein fraction, clearly demonstrating that the glycan portion of milk glycoproteins provided the key substrate for growth. Mass spectrometry-based profiling revealed that B. infantis consumed 73% of neutral and 92% of sialylated N-glycans, while B. lactis degraded only 11% of neutral and virtually no (<1%) sialylated N-glycans. These results provide mechanistic support that N-linked glycoproteins from milk serve as selective substrates for the enrichment of infant-associated bifidobacteria capable of carrying out the initial deglycosylation. Moreover, released N-glycans were better growth substrates than the intact milk glycoproteins, suggesting that EndoBI-1 cleavage is a key initial step in consumption of glycoproteins. Finally, the variety of N-glycans released from bovine milk glycoproteins suggests that they may serve as novel prebiotic substrates with selective properties similar to those of human milk oligosaccharides.ImportanceIt has been previously shown that glycoproteins serve as growth substrates for bifidobacteria. However, which part of a glycoprotein (glycans or polypeptides) is responsible for this function was not known. In this study, we used a novel enzyme to cleave conjugated N-glycans from milk glycoproteins and tested their consumption by various bifidobacteria. The results showed that the glycans selectively stimulated the growth of B. infantis, which is a key infant gut microbe. The selectivity of consumption of individual N-glycans was determined using advanced mass spectrometry (nano-liquid chromatography chip-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry [nano-LC-Chip-Q-TOF MS]) to reveal that B. infantis can consume the range of glycan structures released from whey protein concentrate."

"TURELLI, Michael",Persistence of a Wolbachia infection frequency cline in Drosophila melanogaster and the possible role of reproductive dormancy,"Field populations of arthropods are often polymorphic for Wolbachia but the factors maintaining intermediate Wolbachia frequencies are generally not understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, Wolbachia frequencies are highly variable across the globe. We document the persistence of a Wolbachia infection frequency cline in D. melanogaster populations from eastern Australia across at least 20 years, with frequencies generally high in the tropics but lower in cool temperate regions. The results are interpreted using a model of frequency dynamics incorporating cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), imperfect maternal transmission and Wolbachia effects on fitness. Clinal variation is less pronounced in eastern North America which may reflect annual recolonization at higher latitudes. Limited samples from Africa from latitudes matching our tropical and subtropical samples from Australia and North America show comparably high infection frequencies, but some equatorial samples show lower frequencies. Adult dormancy across cold periods may contribute to the Australian Wolbachia cline. Infected flies exposed to cold conditions for an extended period had reduced fecundity and viability, an effect not evident in unexposed controls. These fitness costs may contribute to the relatively low Wolbachia frequencies in Australian temperate areas; whereas different processes, including CI induced by young males, may contribute to higher frequencies in tropical locations."
"XIANG, Yang K",Phosphorylation of Cav1.2 on S1928 uncouples the Lâ€type Ca2+ channel from the Î²2 adrenergic receptor,"Agonist-triggered downregulation of Î²-adrenergic receptors (ARs) constitutes vital negative feedback to prevent cellular overexcitation. Here, we report a novel downregulation of Î²2AR signaling highly specific for Cav1.2. We find that Î²2-AR binding to Cav1.2 residues 1923-1942 is required for Î²-adrenergic regulation of Cav1.2. Despite the prominence of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Cav1.2 S1928 within the newly identified Î²2AR binding site, its physiological function has so far escaped identification. We show that phosphorylation of S1928 displaces the Î²2AR from Cav1.2 upon Î²-adrenergic stimulation rendering Cav1.2 refractory for several minutes from further Î²-adrenergic stimulation. This effect is lost in S1928A knock-in mice. Although AMPARs are clustered at postsynaptic sites like Cav1.2, Î²2AR association with and regulation of AMPARs do not show such dissociation. Accordingly, displacement of the Î²2AR from Cav1.2 is a uniquely specific desensitization mechanism of Cav1.2 regulation by highly localized Î²2AR/cAMP/PKA/S1928 signaling. The physiological implications of this mechanism are underscored by our finding that LTP induced by prolonged theta tetanus (PTT-LTP) depends on Cav1.2 and its regulation by channel-associated Î²2AR."
"CRUTCHFIELD, James P",Identifying functional thermodynamics in autonomous Maxwellian ratchets,"We introduce a family of Maxwellian Demons for which correlations among information bearing degrees of freedom can be calculated exactly and in compact analytical form. This allows one to precisely determine Demon functional thermodynamic operating regimes, when previous methods either misclassify or simply fail due to approximations they invoke. This reveals that these Demons are more functional than previous candidates. They too behave either as engines, lifting a mass against gravity by extracting energy from a single heat reservoir, or as Landauer erasers, consuming external work to remove information from a sequence of binary symbols by decreasing their individual uncertainty. Going beyond these, our Demon exhibits a new functionality that erases bits not by simply decreasing individual-symbol uncertainty, but by increasing inter-bit correlations (that is, by adding temporal order) while increasing single-symbol uncertainty. In all cases, but especially in the new erasure regime, exactly accounting for informational correlations leads to tight bounds on Demon performance, expressed as a refined Second Law of thermodynamics that relies on the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy for dynamical processes and not on changes purely in system configurational entropy, as previously employed. We rigorously derive the refined Second Law under minimal assumptions and so it applies quite broadly - for Demons with and without memory and input sequences that are correlated or not. We note that general Maxwellian Demons readily violate previously proposed, alternative such bounds, while the current bound still holds. As such, it broadly describes the minimal energetic cost of any computation by a thermodynamic system."

However, molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic alterations for tumor therapeutic resistance are poorly understood. Through gene expression profiling analysis we found that histone H3K36 methyltransferase NSD2/MMSET/WHSC1 expression was highly elevated in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines and clinical tumors. IHC analysis indicated that NSD2 protein overexpression was associated with the disease recurrence and poor survival. Ectopic expression of NSD2 wild type, but not the methylase-defective mutant, drove endocrine resistance in multiple cell models and xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, NSD2 was recruited to and methylated H3K36me2 at the promoters of key glucose metabolic enzyme genes. Its overexpression coordinately up-regulated hexokinase 2 (HK2) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), two key enzymes of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), as well as TP53-induced glycolysis regulatory phosphatase TIGAR. Consequently, NSD2-driven tamoxifen-resistant cells and tumors displayed heightened PPP activity, elevated NADPH production, and reduced ROS level, without significantly altered glycolysis. These results illustrate a coordinated, epigenetic activation of key glucose metabolic enzymes in therapeutic resistance and nominate methyltransferase NSD2 as a potential therapeutic target for endocrine resistant breast cancer."

"GLASER, Nicole",Treatment with the KCa3.1 inhibitor TRAM-34 during diabetic ketoacidosis reduces inflammatory changes in the brain.,"BackgroundDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) causes brain injuries in children ranging from subtle to life-threatening. Previous studies suggest that DKA-related brain injury may involve both stimulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport and microglial activation. Other studies implicate the Na-K-Cl cotransporter and the Ca-activated K channel KCa3.1 in activation of microglia and ischemia-induced brain edema. In this study, we determined whether inhibiting cerebral Na-K-Cl cotransport or KCa3.1 could reduce microglial activation and decrease DKA-related inflammatory changes in the brain.MethodsUsing immunohistochemistry, we investigated cellular alterations in brain specimens from juvenile rats with DKA before, during and after insulin and saline treatment. We compared findings in rats treated with and without bumetanide (an inhibitor of Na-K-Cl cotransport) or the KCa3.1 inhibitor TRAM-34.ResultsGlial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining intensity was increased in the hippocampus during DKA, suggesting reactive astrogliosis. OX42 staining intensity was increased during DKA in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum, indicating microglial activation. Treatment with TRAM-34 decreased both OX42 and GFAP intensity suggesting a decreased inflammatory response to DKA. Treatment with bumetanide did not significantly alter OX42 or GFAP intensity.ConclusionsInhibiting KCa3.1 activity with TRAM-34 during DKA treatment decreases microglial activation and reduces reactive astrogliosis, suggesting a decreased inflammatory response."

Discovered nearly 25&nbsp;years ago, they have been investigated for their use in clinical therapeutics and immunodiagnostics, and more recently for environmental monitoring applications. A new and valuable immunoreagent for the analysis of small molecular weight environmental chemicals, VHH will overcome many pitfalls encountered with conventional reagents. In the work so far, VHH antibodies often perform comparably to conventional antibodies for small molecule analysis, are amenable to numerous genetic engineering techniques, and show ease of adaption to other immunodiagnostic platforms for use in environmental monitoring. Recent reviews cover the structure and production of VHH antibodies as well as their use in clinical settings. However, no report focuses on the use of these VHH antibodies to detect small environmental chemicals (MW < 1500&nbsp;Da). This review article summarizes the efforts made to produce VHHs to various environmental targets, compares the VHH-based assays with conventional antibody assays, and discusses the advantages and limitations in developing these new antibody reagents particularly to small molecule targets.

"YANG, Jun","3,3â€²,4,4â€²,5-Pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) Decreases Hepatic and Systemic Ratios of Epoxide to Diol Metabolites of Unsaturated Fatty Acids in Male Rats","Disruption of the homeostasis of oxygenated regulatory lipid mediators (oxylipins), potential markers of exposure to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists, such as 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126), is associated with a range of diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Here we test the hypothesis that PCB 126 exposure alters the levels of oxylipins in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (5-weeks old) were treated over a 3-month period every 2 weeks with intraperitoneal injections of PCB 126 in corn oil (cumulative doses of 0, 19.8, 97.8, and 390 Âµg/kg b.w.; 6 injections total). PCB 126 treatment caused a reduction in growth rates at the highest dose investigated, a dose-dependent decrease in thymus weights, and a dose-dependent increase in liver weights. Liver PCB 126 levels increased in a dose-dependent manner, while levels in plasma were below or close to the detection limit. The ratios of several epoxides to diol metabolites formed via the cytochrome P450 (P450) monooxygenase/soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) pathway from polyunsaturated fatty acids displayed a dose-dependent decrease in the liver and plasma, whereas levels of oxylipins formed by other metabolic pathways were generally not altered by PCB 126 treatment. The effects of PCB 126 on epoxide-to-diol ratios were associated with an increased CYP1A activity in liver microsomes and an increased sEH activity in liver cytosol and peroxisomes. These results suggest that oxylipins are potential biomarkers of exposure to PCB 126 and that the P450/sEH pathway is a therapeutic target for PCB 126-mediated hepatotoxicity that warrants further attention."

Iron is essential for many facets of cell metabolism in the brain but when altered is likely to contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We previously reported that iron accumulates in the choroid plexus and the putamen in FXTAS and that the level and distribution of key iron-binding proteins are also altered, suggesting a potential alteration of iron metabolism in the brain. Here, we hypothesize that iron metabolism is also altered in the FXTAS cerebellum. To test this hypothesis, we used cerebellum samples collected from FXTAS and control subjects and measured the amount of iron contained within the cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus. We found that the number of iron deposits increased in the cerebellum only&nbsp;in a subset of cases of FXTAS. This accumulation is likely to be mediated by factors other than or in addition to CGG-repeat coupled pathology. Thus, iron deposition in the cerebellum cannot be used as a hallmark of FXTAS pathogenesis."

Age (P = .45), gender (P = .45), and solid organ injury grade (P = .71) were similar between TEG and non-TEG patients. TEG patients had higher Injury Severity Scores compared with non-TEG patients (33.2 vs 18.3, respectively, P < .01). Among the TEG patients, the shear elastic modulus strength and maximum amplitude values began in the normal range within the first 12-hour interval after injury, increased linearly, and crossed into the hypercoagulable range at 48 hours (15.1 Â± 1.9 Kd/cs and 57.6 Â± 1.6 mm, respectively; P < .01, analysis of variance).ConclusionsPatients sustaining blunt abdominal solid organ injuries transition to a hypercoagulable state approximately 48 hours after injury. In the absence of contraindications, pharmacoprophylaxis should be considered before this time for effective venous thromboembolism prevention."

Here we track individual personality and performance and collective performance among groups of social spiders where we manipulated the familiarity of the group members. We show that individual personalities, as measured by consistent individual differences in boldness behavior, strengthen with increasing familiarity and that these personalities can be disrupted by a change in group membership. Changing group membership negatively impacted both individual and group performance. Individuals in less familiar groups lost weight, and these groups were less successful at performing vital collective tasks. These results provide a mechanism for the evolution of stable social groups by demonstrating that social niche reestablishment carries a steep cost for both individuals and groups. Social niche specialization may therefore provide a potential first step on the path toward more organized social systems."

The vast heterogeneity of structures that exist across glycosylation sites hinders the in-depth analysis of glycan changes specific to an individual protein within a complex mixture. In this study, we established a sensitive and specific method for monitoring site-specific glycosylation in rMAbs using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) on an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole MS (UHPLC-QqQ-MS). Our results showed that irrespective of the IgG subclass expressed in the drugs, the N-glycopeptide profiles are nearly the same but differ in abundances. In all rMAb drugs, a single subclass of IgG comprised over 97% of the total IgG content and showed over 97% N-glycan site occupancy. This study demonstrates the utility of an MRM-based method to rapidly characterize over 130 distinct glycopeptides and determine the extent of site occupancy within minutes. Such multilevel structural characterization is important for the successful development of therapeutic antibodies."

Here we define three DUF89 subfamilies (I, II, and III), with subfamily II being split into stand-alone proteins and proteins fused to pantothenate kinase (PanK). We demonstrated that DUF89 proteins have metal-dependent phosphatase activity against reactive phosphoesters or their damaged forms, notably sugar phosphates (subfamilies II and III), phosphopantetheine and its S-sulfonate or sulfonate (subfamily II-PanK fusions), and nucleotides (subfamily I). Genetic and comparative genomic data strongly associated DUF89 genes with phosphoester metabolism. The crystal structure of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) subfamily III protein YMR027W revealed a novel phosphatase active site with fructose 6-phosphate and Mg(2+) bound near conserved signature residues Asp254 and Asn255 that are critical for activity. These findings indicate that DUF89 proteins are previously unrecognized hydrolases whose characteristic in vivo function is to limit potentially harmful buildups of normal or damaged phosphometabolites."

Measurements were taken at 0.5-mm intervals from 1.5&nbsp;mm nasal to 1.5&nbsp;mm temporal to the fovea, and averaged continuously across the central 3&nbsp;mm of the macula. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of reliability (CR) were compared to assess intergrader and intragrader reliability.ResultsChoroidal thickness measurements varied significantly with different posterior boundaries (P < .001 for all). Intergrader ICCs were greater for SCT (0.959-0.980) than for TCT (0.928-0.963) and VCT (0.750-0.869), even in eyes where choroidal-scleral junction visibility was <75%. Intergrader CRs were lower for SCT (41.40-62.31) than for TCT (61.13-74.24) or VCT (72.44-115.11). ICCs and CRs showed greater reliability for averaged VCT, SCT, or TCT measurements than at individual locations. Intragrader ICCs and CRs were comparable to intergrader values.ConclusionsChoroidal thickness measurements are more reproducible when measured to the border of the choroid stroma (SCT) than the vascular lumen (VCT) or sclera (TCT)."
"BROWN, Patrick H","30-Year Trends in Stroke Rates and Outcome in Auckland, New Zealand (1981-2012): A Multi-Ethnic Population-Based Series of Studies.","BackgroundInsufficient data exist on population-based trends in morbidity and mortality to determine the success of prevention strategies and improvements in health care delivery in stroke. The aim of this study was to determine trends in incidence and outcome (1-year mortality, 28-day case-fatality) in relation to management and risk factors for stroke in the multi-ethnic population of Auckland, New Zealand (NZ) over 30-years.MethodsFour stroke incidence population-based register studies were undertaken in adult residents (aged â‰¥15 years) of Auckland NZ in 1981-1982, 1991-1992, 2002-2003 and 2011-2012. All used standard World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria and multiple overlapping sources of case-ascertainment for hospitalised and non-hospitalised, fatal and non-fatal, new stroke events. Ethnicity was consistently self-identified into four major groups. Crude and age-adjusted (WHO world population standard) annual incidence and mortality with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated per 100,000 people, assuming a Poisson distribution.Results5400 new stroke patients were registered in four 12 month recruitment phases over the 30-year study period; 79% were NZ/European, 6% MÄori, 8% Pacific people, and 7% were of Asian or other origin. Overall stroke incidence and 1-year mortality decreased by 23% (95% CI 5%-31%) and 62% (95% CI 36%-86%), respectively, from 1981 to 2012. Whilst stroke incidence and mortality declined across all groups in NZ from 1991, MÄori and Pacific groups had the slowest rate of decline and continue to experience stroke at a significantly younger age (mean ages 60 and 62 years, respectively) compared with NZ/Europeans (mean age 75 years). There was also a decline in 28-day stroke case fatality (overall by 14%, 95% CI 11%-17%) across all ethnic groups from 1981 to 2012. However, there were significant increases in the frequencies of pre-morbid hypertension, myocardial infarction, and diabetes mellitus, but a reduction in frequency of current smoking among stroke patients.ConclusionsIn this unique temporal series of studies spanning 30 years, stroke incidence, early case-fatality and 1-year mortality have declined, but ethnic disparities in risk and outcome for stroke persisted suggesting that primary stroke prevention remains crucial to reducing the burden of this disease."

"NEWMAN, John","Plasma fatty acids, oxylipins, and risk of myocardial infarction: the Singapore Chinese Health Study[S]","We aimed to examine the prospective association between plasma FAs, oxylipins, and risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a Singapore Chinese population. A nested case-control study with 744 incident AMI cases and 744 matched controls aged 47-83 years was conducted within the Singapore Chinese Health Study. Nineteen plasma FAs and 12 oxylipins were quantified using MS. These were grouped into 12 FA clusters and 5 oxylipin clusters using hierarchical clustering, and their associations with AMI risk were assessed. Long-chain n-3 FAs [odds ratio (OR) = 0.67 per SD increase, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53-0.84, P < 0.001] and stearic acid (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.44-0.97, P = 0.03) were inversely associated with AMI risk, whereas arachidonic acid (AA) was positively associated with AMI risk (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.03-1.52, P = 0.02) in the multivariable model with adjustment for other FAs. Further adjustment for oxylipins did not substantially change these associations.

"TIAN, Li",Distinct expression and function of carotenoid metabolic genes and homoeologs in developing wheat grains.,"BackgroundÎ²-carotene, the most active provitamin A molecule produced by plants, plays important roles in human nutrition and health. Î²-carotene does not usually accumulate in the endosperm (i.e. flour) of mature wheat grains, which is a major food source of calories for humans. Therefore, enriching Î²-carotene accumulation in wheat grain endosperm will enable a sustainable dietary supplementation of provitamin A. Several metabolic genes affecting Î²-carotene accumulation have already been isolated from wheat, including phytoene synthase 1 (PSY1), lycopene Îµ-cyclase (LCYe) and carotenoid Î²-ring hydroxylase1/2 (HYD1/2).ResultsIn this work, we cloned and biochemically characterized two carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs), CCD1 and CCD4, from wheat. While CCD1 homoeologs cleaved Î²-apo-8'-carotenal, Î²-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin into apocarotenoid products, CCD4 homoeologs were inactive towards these substrates in in vitro assays. When analyzed by real-time qPCR, PSY1, LCYe, HYD1/2 and CCD1/4 homoeologs showed distinct expression patterns in vegetative tissues and sections of developing tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains, suggesting that carotenoid metabolic genes and homoeologs are differentially regulated at the transcriptional level in wheat.ConclusionsThe CCD1/4 enzyme activity and the spatial-temporal gene expression data provide critical insights into the specific carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs that control Î²-carotene accumulation in wheat grain endosperm, thus establishing the knowledge base for generation of wheat varieties with enhanced Î²-carotene in the endosperm through breeding and genome editing approaches."

"TSOLIS, RenÃ©e M",Energy Taxis toward Host-Derived Nitrate Supports a Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1-Independent Mechanism of Invasion,"UnlabelledSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can cross the epithelial barrier using either the invasion-associated type III secretion system (T3SS-1) or a T3SS-1-independent mechanism that remains poorly characterized. Here we show that flagellum-mediated motility supported a T3SS-1-independent pathway for entering ileal Peyer's patches in the mouse model. Flagellum-dependent invasion of Peyer's patches required energy taxis toward nitrate, which was mediated by the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) Tsr. Generation of nitrate in the intestinal lumen required inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which was synthesized constitutively in the mucosa of the terminal ileum but not in the jejunum, duodenum, or cecum. Tsr-mediated invasion of ileal Peyer's patches was abrogated in mice deficient for Nos2, the gene encoding iNOS. We conclude that Tsr-mediated energy taxis enables S&nbsp;Typhimurium to migrate toward the intestinal epithelium by sensing host-derived nitrate, thereby contributing to invasion of Peyer's patches.ImportanceNontyphoidal Salmonella serovars, such as S.&nbsp;enterica serovar Typhimurium, are a common cause of gastroenteritis in immunocompetent individuals but can also cause bacteremia in immunocompromised individuals. While the invasion-associated type III secretion system (T3SS-1) is important for entry, S&nbsp;Typhimurium strains lacking a functional T3SS-1 can still cross the intestinal epithelium and cause a disseminated lethal infection in mice. Here we observed that flagellum-mediated motility and chemotaxis contributed to a T3SS-1-independent pathway for invasion and systemic dissemination to the spleen. This pathway required the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) Tsr and energy taxis toward host-derived nitrate, which we found to be generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the ileal mucosa prior to infection. Collectively, our data suggest that S&nbsp;Typhimurium enhances invasion by actively migrating toward the intestinal epithelium along a gradient of host-derived nitrate emanating from the mucosal surface of the ileum."

One example is the recent adoption of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which aims to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels. To effectively implement this and similar policies, it is necessary to understand well-to-wheels emissions associated with distinct vehicle and fuel platforms, including those using electricity. This analysis uses an hourly electricity dispatch model to simulate and investigate operation of the current California grid and its response to added vehicle and fuel-related electricity demands in the near term. The model identifies the â€œmarginal electricity mixâ€ â€“ the mix of power plants that is used to supply the incremental electricity demand from vehicles and fuels â€“ and calculates greenhouse gas emissions from those plants. It also quantifies the contribution from electricity to well-to-wheels greenhouse gas emissions from battery-electric, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles and explores sensitivities of electricity supply and emissions to hydro-power availability, timing of electricity demand (including vehicle recharging), and demand location within the state. The results suggest that the near-term marginal electricity mix for vehicles and fuels in California will come from natural gas-fired power plants, including a significant fraction (likely as much as 40%) from relatively inefficient steam- and combustion-turbine plants. The marginal electricity emissions rate will be higher than the average rate from all generation â€“ likely to exceed 600 gCO2 equiv. kWhâˆ’1 during most hours of the day and months of the year â€“ and will likely be more than 60% higher than the value estimated in the Low Carbon Fuel Standard. But despite the relatively high fuel carbon intensity of marginal electricity in California, alternative vehicle and fuel platforms still reduce emissions compared to conventional gasoline vehicles and hybrids, through improved vehicle efficiency."

More extensive molecular analysis of metastatic ovarian cancer is needed to identify post-translational modifications of proteins, especially glycosylation that is particularly associated with metastatic disease to better understand the metastatic process and identify potential therapeutic targets. Glycoproteins in ascites fluid were enriched by affinity binding to lectins (ConA or WGA) and other affinity matrices. Separate glycomic, proteomic, and glycopeptide analyses were performed. Relative abundances of different N-glycan groups and proteins were identified from ascites fluids and a serum control. Levels of biomarkers CA125, MUC1, and fibronectin were also monitored in OC ascites samples by Western blot analysis. N-Glycan analysis of ascites fluids showed the presence of large, highly fucosylated and sialylated complex and hybrid glycans, some of which were not observed in normal serum. OC ascites glycoproteins, haptoglobin, fibronectin, lumican, fibulin, hemopexin, ceruloplasmin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin were more abundant in OC ascites or not present in serum control samples. Further glycopeptide analysis of OC ascites identified N- and O-glycans in clusterin, hemopexin, and fibulin glycopeptides, some of which are unusual and may be important in OC metastasis."

Established tomato mapping populations between domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and its more distant interfertile relatives typically follow a near isogenic line (NIL) design, such as the S. pennellii Introgression Line (IL) population, with a single wild introgression per line in an otherwise domesticated genetic background. Here, we report on a new advanced backcross QTL mapping resource for tomato, derived from a cross between the M82 tomato cultivar and S. pennellii This so-called Backcrossed Inbred Line (BIL) population is comprised of a mix of BC2 and BC3 lines, with domesticated tomato as the recurrent parent. The BIL population is complementary to the existing S. pennellii IL population, with which it shares parents. Using the BILs, we mapped traits for leaf complexity, leaflet shape, and flowering time. We demonstrate the utility of the BILs for fine-mapping QTL, particularly QTL initially mapped in the ILs, by fine-mapping several QTL to single or few candidate genes. Moreover, we confirm the value of a backcrossed population with multiple introgressions per line, such as the BILs, for epistatic QTL mapping. Our work was further enabled by the development of our own statistical inference and visualization tools, namely a heterogeneous hidden Markov model for genotyping the lines, and by using state-of-the-art sparse regression techniques for QTL mapping."

We set out to identify the bacteria in raw milk collected for large-scale dairy product manufacturing. Raw bovine milk samples from 899 tanker trucks arriving at two dairy processors in San Joaquin Valley of California during three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) were analyzed by community 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This analysis revealed highly diverse bacterial populations, which exhibited seasonal differences. Raw milk collected in the spring contained the most diverse bacterial communities, with the highest total cell numbers and highest proportions being those of Actinobacteria Even with this complexity, a core microbiota was present, consisting of 29 taxonomic groups and high proportions of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus and unidentified members of Clostridiales Milk samples were also collected from five large-volume silos and from 13 to 25 tankers whose contents were unloaded into each of them during 2&nbsp;days in the summer. Transfer of the milk to storage silos resulted in two community types. One group of silos contained a high proportion of Streptococcus spp. and was similar in that respect to the tankers that filled them. The community found in the other group of silos was distinct and dominated by Acinetobacter Overall, despite highly diverse tanker milk community structures, distinct milk bacterial communities were selected within the processing facility environment. This knowledge can inform the development of new sanitation procedures and process controls to ensure the consistent production of safe and high-quality dairy products on a global scale. Raw milk harbors diverse bacteria that are crucial determinants of the quality and safety of fluid milk and (fermented) dairy products. These bacteria enter farm milk during transport, storage, and processing. Although pathogens are destroyed by pasteurization, not all bacteria and their associated enzymes are eliminated. Our comprehensive analyses of the bacterial composition of raw milk upon arrival and shortly after storage at major dairy processors showed that the communities of milk microbiota are highly diverse. Even with these differences, there was a core microbiota that exhibited distinct seasonal trends. Remarkably, the effects of the processing facility outweighed those of the raw milk microbiome and the microbial composition changed distinctly within some but not all silos within a short time after transfer. This knowledge can be used to inform cleaning and sanitation procedures as well as to enable predictions of the microbial communities in raw milk that result in either high-quality or defective products."

"HESSL, David R",Psychiatric disorders among women with the fragile X premutation without children affected by fragile X syndrome,"Several studies have demonstrated increased rates of anxiety and depressive disorders among female carriers of the fragile X premutation. However, the majority of these studies focused on mothers of children with fragile X syndrome, who experience higher rates of parenting stress that may contribute to the emergence of these disorders. The present study compared psychiatric symptom presentation (utilizing measures of current symptoms and lifetime DSM-IV Axis I disorders) in 24 female carriers without affected children (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰32.1 years) to 26 non-carrier women from the community (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰30.5 years). We also examined the association between CGG repeat size (adjusted for X activation ratio) and mRNA, with severity of psychiatric symptoms. Women with the premutation reported significantly elevated symptoms of anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsiveness, and somatization relative to controls during the past week. Carriers had significantly higher rates of lifetime social phobia (42.3%) compared to controls (12.5%); however, this comparison did not remain significant after multiple comparison adjustment. Rates of other psychiatric disorders were not significantly elevated relative to controls, though it should be noted that lifetime rates among controls were much higher than previously published population estimates. Although the sample is relatively small, the study of this unique cohort suggests the premutation confers risk for mood and anxiety disorders independent of the stress of parenting children with FXS. Screening for psychiatric disorders in women with the premutation, even before they become parents, is important and highly encouraged. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

"KEBREAB, Ermias",Review of current in vivo measurement techniques for quantifying enteric methane emission from ruminants,"Ruminant husbandry is a major source of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG). Filling knowledge gaps and providing expert recommendation are important for defining future research priorities, improving methodologies and establishing science-based GHG mitigation solutions to government and non-governmental organisations, advisory/extension networks, and the ruminant livestock sector. The objectives of this review is to summarize published literature to provide a detailed assessment of the methodologies currently in use for measuring enteric methane (CH4) emission from individual animals under specific conditions, and give recommendations regarding their application. The methods described include respiration chambers and enclosures, sulphur hexafluoride tracer (SF6) technique, and techniques based on short-term measurements of gas concentrations in samples of exhaled air. This includes automated head chambers (e.g. the GreenFeed system), the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a marker, and (handheld) laser CH4 detection. Each of the techniques are compared and assessed on their capability and limitations, followed by methodology recommendations. It is concluded that there is no â€˜one size fits allâ€™ method for measuring CH4 emission by individual animals. Ultimately, the decision as to which method to use should be based on the experimental objectives and resources available. However, the need for high throughput methodology e.g. for screening large numbers of animals for genomic studies, does not justify the use of methods that are inaccurate. All CH4 measurement techniques are subject to experimental variation and random errors. Many sources of variation must be considered when measuring CH4 concentration in exhaled air samples without a quantitative or at least regular collection rate, or use of a marker to indicate (or adjust) for the proportion of exhaled CH4 sampled. Consideration of the number and timing of measurements relative to diurnal patterns of CH4 emission and respiratory exchange are important, as well as consideration of feeding patterns and associated patterns of rumen fermentation rate and other aspects of animal behaviour. Regardless of the method chosen, appropriate calibrations and recovery tests are required for both method establishment and routine operation. Successful and correct use of methods requires careful attention to detail, rigour, and routine self-assessment of the quality of the data they provide."

"HUSSAIN, Shehnaz K",MicroRNA-related Polymorphisms and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Susceptibility in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNA) regulate gene expression through binding to the 3' untranslated region of target messenger RNA (mRNA) and have been implicated in lymphomagenesis. Only a few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of miRNA-related genes. In this study, we will test hypotheses to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within miRNA binding sites, miRNA coding regions, or miRNA processing genes, (collectively referred to as miRNA-related SNPs), are associated with susceptibility of AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma (AIDS-NHL) among men from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS).Methods: We genotyped 25 miRNA-related SNPs in 180 AIDS-NHL cases and 529 matched HIV-infected controls. Adjusted odds ratios (ORadj) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression, controlling for age, CD4+ T-cell count, HIV viral load, prior AIDS diagnosis, history of anti-retroviral therapy, race, and history of HCV infection, to estimate the associations between miRNA-associated SNPs and overall, systemic and central nervous system (CNS) AIDS-NHL. The semi-Bayes (SB) approach was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Through the incorporation of a normal prior of null-association (prior odds ratio, ORprior = 1.00; 95% prior limits: 0.25, 4.00), we proposed to pull observed associations toward the null, emphasizing our uncertainty. To give a comprehensive overview of our data and results, we presented both suggested (alpha=0.10) and statistically significant results (alpha=0.05), while noting those that remained evident after SB correction. We did place highlighted emphasis on significant results which remained evident after the SB approach as we were more confident in the report of these results (GEMIN3 rs197412, miR-196a rs11614913, and HIF1A rs2057482). Further, results were focused to those from analyses imputed for HIV viral load at set point and CD4+ T-cell count at reference date. Last, we estimated the association between SNPs within miRNA processing genes and mean loge miRNA serum levels among a subgroup of 77 MACS participants, comprised of 61 AIDS-NHL cases and 16 HIV-infected controls. Mean ratios (MRadj) and 95% CIs were calculated using linear regression, controlling for AIDS-NHL case-control status, CD4+ T-cell count at date of serum sample, and race.Results: GEMIN3 rs197412, a non-synonymous SNP within a gene involved in miRNA processing and maturation, was associated with AIDS-NHL overall (ORadj= 1.35 per variant allele; 95% CI: 1.03-1.78). In subgroup analyses, an inverse association was observed between miR-196a rs11614913 and CNS HIV/AIDS NHL (CT/TT vs. CC ORadj= 0.43; 95% CI: 0.22-0.87). The variant allele of HIF1A rs2057482 was associated with increased risk of systemic AIDS-NHL (ORadj= 1.83 per variant allele; 95% CI: 1.16-2.90), whereas the same allele was associated with decreased risk of CNS AIDS-NHL (ORadj= 0.38 per variant allele; 95% CI: 0.17-0.87). These miRNA-related SNP associations with AIDS-NHL remained evident after SB correction. In the evaluation of genotype-phenotype associations, there was a suggested association between carriership of the variant allele (C) of GEMIN3 rs197412 with higher miRNA-222 serum levels compared to those with the referent genotype (MRadj= 1.21 per variant allele; 95% CI: 0.98-1.49), suggesting a potential functional effect of GEMIN3 rs197412 in relation to miRNA-222 expression. Conclusion: These results suggest that miRNA-related SNPs are associated with AIDS-NHL susceptibility. Specifically, our study demonstrated that GEMIN3 rs197412 was associated with AIDS-NHL susceptibility, and that genetic variation within this miRNA processing gene may influence subsequent miRNA expression. Further, miR-196a rs11614913 and HIF1A rs2057482 AIDS-NHL were also associated with AIDS-NHL, highlighting the diverse array of biologic mechanisms underlying AIDS-lymphomagenesis."

Fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) was applied to detect F. nucleatum in CRC and normal tissues. The difference of F. nucleatum abundance between cancer and normal tissues and the relationship of F. nucleatum abundance with clinical variables were evaluated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on 22 CRC tissues with the highest F. nucleatum abundance by FQ-PCR testing to confirm FQ-PCR results.ResultsThe median abundance of F. nucleatum in CRC tissues [0.242 (0.178-0.276)] was significantly higher than that in normal controls [0.050 (0.023-0.067)] (P < 0.001). F. nucleatum was over-represented in 88/101 (87.1%) CRC samples. The abundance of F. nucleatum determined by 2(-Î”CT) was significantly greater in tumor samples [0.242 (0.178, 0.276)] than in normal controls [0.050 (0.023, 0.067)] (P < 0.001). The frequency of patients with lymph node metastases was higher in the over-abundance group [52/88 (59.1%)] than in the under-abundance group [0/13 (0%)] (P < 0.005). No significant association of F. nucleatum with other clinico-pathological variables was observed (P > 0.05). FISH analysis also found more F. nucleatum in CRC than in normal tissues (median number 6, 25(th) 3, 75(th) 10 vs 2, 25(th) 1, 75(th) 5) (P < 0.01).ConclusionF. nucleatum was enriched in CRC tissues and associated with CRC development and metastasis."

Here we employ high-resolution mass spectrometric profiling to comprehensively identify and quantitatively measure the exact modifications of native intestinal epithelial cell surface N-glycans induced by S. typhimurium infection. Sixty minutes postinfection, select sialylated structures showed decreases in terms of total number and abundances. To assess the effect of cell surface mannosylation, we selectively rerouted glycan expression on the host using the alpha-mannosidase inhibitor, kifunensine, toward overexpression of high mannose. Under these conditions, internalization of S. typhimurium significantly increased, demonstrating that bacteria show preference for particular structures. Finally, we developed a novel assay to measure membrane glycoprotein turnover rates, which revealed that glycan modifications occur by bacterial enzyme activity rather than by host-derived restructuring strategies. This study is the first to provide precise structural information on how host N-glycans are altered to support S. typhimurium invasion."
"DECARLI, Charles",Atherosclerotic Plaques in the Aortic Arch and Subclinical Cerebrovascular Disease,"Background and purposeAortic arch plaque (AAP) is a risk factor for ischemic stroke, but its association with subclinical cerebrovascular disease is not established. We investigated the association between AAP and subclinical cerebrovascular disease in an elderly stroke-free community-based cohort.MethodsThe CABL study (Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions) was designed to investigate cardiovascular predictors of silent cerebrovascular disease in the elderly. AAPs were assessed by suprasternal transthoracic echocardiography in 954 participants. Silent brain infarcts and white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) were assessed by brain magnetic resonance imaging. The association of AAP thickness with silent brain infarcts and WMHV was evaluated by logistic regression analysis.ResultsMean age was 71.6Â±9.3 years; 63% were women. AAP was present in 658 (69%) subjects. Silent brain infarcts were detected in 138 participants (14.5%). In multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders, AAP thickness and large AAP (â‰¥4 mm in thickness) were significantly associated with the upper quartile of WMHV (WMHV-Q4; odds ratio =1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.32; P=0.009 and odds ratio =1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-3.09; P=0.036, respectively), but not with silent brain infarcts (odds ratio =1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.23; P=0.265 and odds ratio =1.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-2.77; P=0.251, respectively).ConclusionsAortic arch atherosclerosis was associated with WMHV in a stroke-free community-based elderly cohort. This association was stronger in subjects with large plaques and independent of cardiovascular risk factors. Aortic arch assessment by transthoracic echocardiography may help identify subjects at higher risk of subclinical cerebrovascular disease, who may benefit from aggressive stroke risk factors treatment."

"BRADAC, Marusa",THE GRISM LENS-AMPLIFIED SURVEY FROM SPACE (GLASS). VII. THE DIVERSITY OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF STAR FORMATION IN CLUSTER AND FIELD GALAXIES AT 0.3 â‰¤ z â‰¤ 0.7,"Exploiting the slitless spectroscopy taken as part of the Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS), we present an extended analysis of the spatial distribution of star formation in 76 galaxies in 10 clusters at 0.3 < z < 0.7. We use 85 foreground and background galaxies in the same redshift range as a field sample. The samples are well matched in stellar mass (108-1011 MâŠ™) and star formation rate (0.5-50 MâŠ™ yr-1). We visually classify galaxies in terms of broad band morphology, H? morphology, and likely physical process acting on the galaxy. Most H? emitters have a spiral morphology (41% Â± 8% in clusters, 51% Â± 8% in the field), followed by mergers/interactions (28% Â± 8%, 31% Â±7%, respectively) and early-type galaxies (remarkably as high as 29% Â±8% in clusters and 15% Â± 6% in the field). A diversity of H? morphologies is detected, suggesting a diversity of physical processes. In clusters, 30% Â± 8% of the galaxies present a regular morphology, mostly consistent with star formation diffused uniformly across the stellar population (mostly in the disk component, when present). The second most common morphology (28% Â±8%) is asymmetric/jellyfish, consistent with rampressure stripping or other non-gravitational processes in 18% Â± 8% of the cases. Ram-pressure stripping appears significantly less prominent in the field (2% Â± 2%), where the most common morphology/mechanism appears to be consistent with minor gas-rich mergers or clump accretion. This work demonstrates that while environmentspecific mechanisms affect galaxy evolution at this redshift, they are diverse and their effects are subtle. A full understanding of this complexity requires larger samples and detailed and spatially resolved physical models."

This strategy would potentially enable the fabrication of thermoelectric devices based on silicon, the cheapest, most integrable and easiest to dope Earth-abundant semiconductor. A drastic reduction of the thermal conductivity, which would lead to a proportional enhancement of the figure of merit, was observed for silicon low-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanowires and ultra-thin membranes. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the phononic properties of the latter, and we show that dimensionality reduction alone is not sufficient to hinder heat transport to a great extent. In turn, the presence of surface roughness at the nanoscale reduces the thermal conductivity of sub-10 nm membranes up to 10 times with respect to bulk."

Diagnostic approaches for dental disease include gross oral examination, endoscopic oral examination, skull radiography, and computed tomography (CT). CT overcomes many limitations of standard radiography by permitting cross-sectional images of the rabbit head in multiple planes without superimposition of anatomic structures. Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is an oral and maxillofacial imaging modality that produces high-resolution images. The objective of this study was to describe and compare the normal anatomic features of the dentition and surrounding maxillofacial structures in healthy rabbits on CBCT and conventional CT. Ten New Zealand white rabbit cadaver heads were scanned using CBCT and conventional CT. Images were evaluated using Anatomage Invivo 5 software. The maxillofacial anatomy was labeled on CBCT images, and the mean lengths and widths of the teeth were determined. The visibility of relevant dental and anatomic features (pulp cavity, germinal center, tooth outline, periodontal ligament) were scored and compared between conventional CT and CBCT. The thinnest teeth were the maxillary second incisor teeth at 1.29â€‰Â±â€‰0.26â€‰mm and the maxillary third molar teeth at 1.04â€‰Â±â€‰0.10â€‰mm. In general, it was found that CBCT was superior to conventional CT when imaging the dentition. Importantly, the periodontal ligament was significantly (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) more visible on CBCT than on conventional CT. Ability to see the periodontal ligament with such detail may allow earlier detection and treatment of periodontal disease in rabbits. This study is the first of its kind and shows the feasibility and yield of CBCT when evaluating the maxillofacial features and dentition in rabbits."
"CATZ, Sheryl L",Telemedicine in Greenland: Citizens' Perspectives.,"BackgroundTelemedicine may have the possibility to provide better access to healthcare delivery for the citizens. Telemedicine in arctic remote areas must be tailored according to the needs of the local population. Therefore, we need more knowledge about their needs and their view of telemedicine.ObjectiveThe aim of this study has been to explore how citizens living in the Greenlandic settlements experience the possibilities and challenges of telemedicine when receiving healthcare delivery in everyday life.Materials and methodsCase study design was chosen as the overall research design. Qualitative interviews (nâ€‰=â€‰14) were performed and participant observations (nâ€‰=â€‰80â€‰h) carried out in the local healthcare center in the settlements and towns. A logbook was kept and updated each day during the field research in Greenland. Observations were made of activities in the settlements.FindingsData collected on citizens' views about the possibilities of using telemedicine in Greenland revealed the following findings: Greenlandic citizens are positive toward telemedicine, and telemedicine can help facilitate improved access to healthcare for residents in these Greenlandic settlements. Regarding challenges in using telemedicine in Greenland, the geographical and cultural context hinders accessibility to the Greenlandic healthcare system, and telemedicine equipment is not sufficiently mobile.ConclusionGreenlandic citizens are positive toward telemedicine and regard telemedicine as a facilitator for improved access for healthcare in the Greenlandic settlements. We have identified challenges, such as geographical and cultural context, that hinder accessibility to the Greenlandic healthcare system."

"LEIN, Pamela J",Reference compounds for alternative test methods to indicate developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) potential of chemicals: example lists and criteria for their selection and use,"There is a paucity of information concerning the developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) hazard posed by industrial and environmental chemicals. New testing approaches will most likely be based on batteries of alternative and complementary (non-animal) tests. As DNT is assumed to result from the modulation of fundamental neurodevelopmental processes (such as neuronal differentiation, precursor cell migration or neuronal network formation) by chemicals, the first generation of alternative DNT tests target these processes. The advantage of such types of assays is that they capture toxicants with multiple targets and modes-of-action. Moreover, the processes modelled by the assays can be linked to toxicity endophenotypes, i.e., alterations in neural connectivity that form the basis for neurofunctional deficits in man. The authors of this review convened in a workshop to define criteria for the selection of positive/negative controls, to prepare recommendations on their use, and to initiate the setup of a directory of reference chemicals. For initial technical optimization of tests, a set of > 50 endpoint-specific control compounds was identified. For further test development, an additional ""test"" set of 33 chemicals considered to act directly as bona fide DNT toxicants is proposed, and each chemical is annotated to the extent it fulfills these criteria. A tabular compilation of the original literature used to select the test set chemicals provides information on statistical procedures, and toxic/non-toxic doses (both for pups and dams). Suggestions are provided on how to use the > 100 compounds (including negative controls) compiled here to address specificity, adversity and use of alternative test systems."
"WETZEL, Andrew R","Galaxy evolution in groups and clusters: star formation rates, red sequence fractions and the persistent bimodality","Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues created from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we examine in detail the specific star formation rate (SSFR) distribution of satellite galaxies and its dependence on stellar mass, host halo mass and halo-centric radius. All galaxies, regardless of central satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal SSFR distribution, with a strong break at SSFR â‰ˆ 10-11yr-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no regime is there ever an excess of galaxies in the 'green valley'. Satellite galaxies are simply more likely to lie on the quenched ('red sequence') side of the SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar mass. An enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups with halo masses down to 3 Ã— 1011MâŠ™ and increases strongly with halo mass and towards halo centre. We find no detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond âˆ¼2Rvir around massive clusters once these galaxies have been decomposed into centrals and satellites. These trends imply that (1) galaxies experience no significant environmental effects until they cross within âˆ¼Rvir of a more massive host halo; (2) after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve in the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyr; and (3) once begun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. These results place strong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as we will discuss further in companion papers.

The new method is applicable to ab initio simulations with hundreds of atoms containing complex and multimolecular reaction events. A key aspect of nebterpolation is smoothing of the reactive MD trajectory in internal coordinates to initiate the search for the reaction path on the potential energy surface. We apply nebterpolation to analyze the reaction events in an ab initio nanoreactor simulation that discovers new molecules and mechanisms, including a C-C coupling pathway for glycolaldehyde synthesis. We find that the new method, which incorporates information from the MD trajectory that connects reactants with products, produces a dramatically distinct set of minimum energy paths compared to existing approaches that start from information for the reaction end points alone. The energy refinement method described here represents a key component of an emerging simulation paradigm where molecular dynamics simulations are applied to discover the possible reaction mechanisms."

The relationship between androgenic hormones, like testosterone (T), and aggression is extensively studied in human populations. Yet, while this work has illuminated a variety of principals regarding the behavioral and phenotypic effects of T, it is also hindered by inherent limitations of performing research on people. In these instances, animal research can be used to gain further insight into the complex mechanisms by which T influences aggression. Here, we explore recent studies on T and aggression in numerous vertebrate species, although we focus primarily on males and on a New World rodent called the California mouse (Peromyscus californicus). This species is highly territorial and monogamous, resembling the modern human social disposition. We review (i) how baseline and dynamic T levels predict and/or impact aggressive behavior and disposition; (ii) how factors related to social and physical context influence T and aggression; (iii) the reinforcing or ""rewarding"" aspects of aggressive behavior; and (iv) the function of T on aggression before and during a combative encounter. Included are areas that may need further research. We argue that animal studies investigating these topics fill in gaps to help paint a more complete picture of how androgenic steroids drive the output of aggressive behavior in all animals, including humans."

Here we evaluate the first two years of lease market activity and participation.  We find the program may provide beneficial flexibility to some commercial quota holders, with the number of transfers to the charter sector being greater than transfers within the commercial sector for some types of commercial quota. We also identify a high proportion of self-leasers. However, transfers to the charter sector are on average smaller than within-sector commercial transfers, and total poundage leased by the charter sector is low compared to commercial transfers. Finally, the value-per-pound may be higher in the charter sector, as commercial-to-charter transfer prices approach the commercial ex-vessel price."

Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, Physical Activity Scores of the Elderly (PASE) and thigh muscle characteristics including strength, fat infiltration (Goutallier score) and thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) MR measurements were obtained at baseline.

Multivariate regression models, adjusting for covariates (age, gender, body mass index), were used for statistical analysis.ResultsAt baseline, subjects with prevalent ACL ruptures had worse WORMS total scores (meanÂ±SEM, 44.1Â±3.5) than subjects with ACL reconstruction (30.8Â±4.0; P = 0.015) and worse than subjects with normal ACL (21.3Â±3.0; P<0.001). Cartilage scores were worse in both femorotibial compartments in ACL injured knees than in knees with normal ACL (P<0.05). Knees with ACL reconstruction showed an increased degeneration of the medial meniscus (P = 0.036), cartilage degeneration at the medial femoral condyle (P = 0.011). In a multivariate regression model, including both ACL groups and total muscle characteristics as influence parameters, high thigh muscle CSA, high muscle/ fat ratio and low Goutallier scores were associated with less degenerative changes at the knee, independent of ACL status. Knees with ACL reconstruction showed an increased progression of cartilage degeneration at the medial tibia compared to the normal ACL group (P = 0.027).ConclusionsHigh thigh muscle CSA is associated with less degenerative changes at the knee, independent of the ACL status and may potentially be advantageous in the prevention of early OA."

One of the objectives of this project is the assessment of the uncertainties associated with nonlinear simulation of 1D site effects. A first verification phase (i.e., comparison between numerical codes on simple idealistic cases) will be followed by a validation phase, comparing the predictions of such numerical estimations with actual strongmotion recordings obtained at well-known sites. The benchmark presently involves 21 teams and 23 different computational codes. We present here the main results of the verification phase dealing with simple cases. Three different idealized soil profiles were tested over a wide range of shear strains with different input motions and different boundary conditions at the sediment/bedrock interface. A first iteration focusing on the elastic and viscoelastic cases was proved to be useful to ensure a common understanding and to identify numerical issues before pursuing the nonlinear modeling. Besides minor mistakes in the implementation of input parameters and output units, the initial discrepancies between the numerical results can be attributed to (1) different understanding of the expression â€œinput motionâ€ in different communities, and (2) different implementations of material damping and possible numerical energy dissipation. The second round of computations thus allowed a convergence of all teams to the Haskellâ€“Thomson analytical solution in elastic and viscoelastic cases. For nonlinear computations, we investigate the epistemic uncertainties related only to wave propagation modeling using different nonlinear constitutive models. Such epistemic uncertainties are shown to increase with the strain level and to reach values around 0.2 (log10 scale) for a peak ground acceleration of 5 m=s2 at the base of the soil column, which may be reduced by almost 50% when the various constitutive models used the same shear strength and damping implementation."
"LEIN, Pamela J",From the Cover: BDE-47 and BDE-49 Inhibit Axonal Growth in Primary Rat Hippocampal Neuron-Glia Co-Cultures via Ryanodine Receptor-Dependent Mechanisms,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widespread environmental contaminants associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children and preclinical models; however, the mechanisms by which PBDEs cause developmental neurotoxicity remain speculative. The structural similarity between PBDEs and nondioxin-like (NDL) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) suggests shared toxicological properties. Consistent with this, both NDL PCBs and PBDEs have been shown to stabilize ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the open configuration. NDL PCB effects on RyR activity are causally linked to increased dendritic arborization, but whether PBDEs similarly enhance dendritic growth is not known. In this study, we quantified the effects of individual PBDE congeners on not only dendritic but also axonal growth since both are regulated by RyR-dependent mechanisms, and both are critical determinants of neuronal connectivity. Neuronal-glial co-cultures dissociated from the neonatal rat hippocampus were exposed to BDE-47 or BDE-49 in the culture medium. At concentrations ranging from 20â€‰pM to 2 ÂµM, neither PBDE congener altered dendritic arborization. In contrast, at concentrations â‰¥ 200â€‰pM, both congeners delayed neuronal polarization resulting in significant inhibition of axonal outgrowth during the first few days in vitro. The axon inhibitory effects of these PBDE congeners occurred independent of cytotoxicity, and were blocked by pharmacological antagonism of RyR or siRNA knockdown of RyR2. These results demonstrate that the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which PBDEs interfere with neurodevelopment overlap with but are distinct from those of NDL PCBs, and suggest that altered patterns of neuronal connectivity may contribute to the developmental neurotoxicity of PBDEs."

In this study, we produced a secreted anthrax decoy fusion protein comprised of a portion of the human capillary morphogenesis gene-2 (CMG2) protein fused via a linker to the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of human immunoglobulin G1 in Nicotiana benthamiana plants using a transient expression system. Using the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and co-expression with the p19 gene silencing suppressor, we were able to achieve a high level of recombinant CMG2-Fc-Apo (rCMG2-Fc-Apo) protein accumulation. Production kinetics were observed up to eight days post-infiltration, and maximum production of 826 mg/kg fresh leaf weight was observed on day six. Protein A affinity chromatography purification of the rCMG2-Fc-Apo protein from whole leaf extract and apoplast wash fluid showed the homodimeric form under non-reducing gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the molecular integrity of the secreted protein. The N-glycosylation pattern of purified rCMG2-Fc-Apo protein was analysed; the major portion of N-glycans consists of complex type structures in both protein samples. The most abundant (>50%) N-glycan structure was GlcNAcâ‚‚(Xyl)Manâ‚ƒ(Fuc)GlcNAcâ‚‚ in rCMG2-Fc-Apo recovered from whole leaf extract and apoplast wash fluid. High mannose N-glycan structures were not detected in the apoplast wash fluid preparation, which confirmed the protein secretion. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that high-level production of rCMG2-Fc-Apo can be achieved by transient production in Nicotiana benthamiana plants with apoplast targeting."

How chromatin and DNA methylation interact with environmental exposures at synaptic genes in autism etiologies is currently unclear. Using&nbsp;whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in brain tissue and a neuronal cell culture model carrying a 15q11.2-q13.3 maternal duplication, we find that significant global DNA hypomethylation is enriched over autism candidate genes and affects gene expression. The cumulative effect of multiple chromosomal duplications and exposure to the pervasive persistent organic pollutant PCB 95 altered methylation of&nbsp;more than 1,000 genes. Hypomethylated genes were enriched for H2A.Z, increased maternal UBE3A in Dup15q corresponded to reduced levels of RING1B, and bivalently modified H2A.Z was altered by PCB 95 and duplication. These results demonstrate the compounding effects of genetic and environmental insults on the neuronal methylome that converge upon dysregulation of chromatin and synaptic genes."

Fibroblasts/myofibroblasts are thought to be the major cell type involved in encapsulation, but it is unclear whether and how stem cells contribute to this process. Here we show, for the first time, that Sox10+ adult stem cells contribute to both encapsulation and microvessel formation. Sox10+ adult stem cells were found sparsely in the stroma of subcutaneous loose connective tissues. Upon subcutaneous biomaterial implantation, Sox10+ stem cells were activated and recruited to the biomaterial scaffold, and differentiated into fibroblasts and then myofibroblasts. This differentiation process from Sox10+ stem cells to myofibroblasts could be recapitulated in vitro. On the other hand, Sox10+ stem cells could differentiate into perivascular cells to stabilize newly formed microvessels. Sox10+ stem cells and endothelial cells in three-dimensional co-culture self-assembled into microvessels, and platelet-derived growth factor had chemotactic effect on Sox10+ stem cells. Transplanted Sox10+ stem cells differentiated into smooth muscle cells to stabilize functional microvessels. These findings demonstrate the critical role of adult stem cells in tissue remodeling and unravel the complexity of stem cell fate determination."
"BAUMLER, Andreas J","Respiration of Microbiota-Derived 1,2-propanediol Drives Salmonella Expansion during Colitis","Intestinal inflammation caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium increases the availability of electron acceptors that fuel a respiratory growth of the pathogen in the intestinal lumen. Here we show that one of the carbon sources driving this respiratory expansion in the mouse model is 1,2-propanediol, a microbial fermentation product. 1,2-propanediol utilization required intestinal inflammation induced by virulence factors of the pathogen. S. Typhimurium used both aerobic and anaerobic respiration to consume 1,2-propanediol and expand in the murine large intestine. 1,2-propanediol-utilization did not confer a benefit in germ-free mice, but the pdu genes conferred a fitness advantage upon S. Typhimurium in mice mono-associated with Bacteroides fragilis or Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Collectively, our data suggest that intestinal inflammation enables S. Typhimurium to sidestep nutritional competition by respiring a microbiota-derived fermentation product."

We evaluated associations between detailed family history and breast cancer risk while accounting for breast density.Methods: We followed 222,019 participants ages 35 to 74 in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, of whom 2,456 developed invasive breast cancer. We calculated standardized breast cancer risks within joint strata of breast density and simple (1st-degree female relative) or detailed (first-degree, second-degree, or first- and second-degree female relative) breast cancer family history. We fit log-binomial models to estimate age-specific breast cancer associations for simple and detailed family history, accounting for breast density.Results: Simple first-degree family history was associated with increased breast cancer risk compared with no first-degree history [Risk ratio (RR), 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-2.1 at age 40; RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7 at age 50; RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6 at age 60; RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5 at age 70). Breast cancer associations with detailed family history were strongest for women with first- and second-degree family history compared with no history (RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.2 at age 40); this association weakened in higher age groups (RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.88-1.5 at age 70). Associations did not change substantially when adjusted for breast density.Conclusions: Even with adjustment for breast density, a history of breast cancer in both first- and second-degree relatives is more strongly associated with breast cancer than simple first-degree family history.Impact: Future efforts to improve breast cancer risk prediction models should evaluate detailed family history as a risk factor.

Little is known about the effects of HMO composition and its changes on the morbidity and growth outcomes of infants living in areas with high infection rates. Mother's HMO composition and infant gut microbiota from 33 Gambian mother/infant pairs at 4, 16, and 20 weeks postpartum were analyzed for relationships between HMOs, microbiota, and infant morbidity and growth. The data indicate that lacto-N-fucopentaose I was associated with decreased infant morbidity, and 3'-sialyllactose was found to be a good indicator of infant weight-for-age. Because HMOs, gut microbiota, and infant health are interrelated, the relationship between infant health and their microbiome were analyzed. While bifidobacteria were the dominant genus in the infant gut overall, Dialister and Prevotella were negatively correlated with morbidity, and Bacteroides was increased in infants with abnormal calprotectin. Mothers nursing in the wet season (July to October) produced significantly less oligosaccharides compared to those nursing in the dry season (November to June). These results suggest that specific types and structures of HMOs are sensitive to environmental conditions, protective of morbidity, predictive of growth, and correlated with specific microbiota."
"HARPER, Richart W",Effects of positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers in a ventilator-induced injury mouse model,"BackgroundPositive-pressure mechanical ventilation is an essential therapeutic intervention, yet it causes the clinical syndrome known as ventilator-induced lung injury. Various lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies have attempted to reduce or prevent ventilator-induced lung injury but few modalities have proven effective. A model that isolates the contribution of mechanical ventilation on the development of acute lung injury is needed to better understand biologic mechanisms that lead to ventilator-induced lung injury.ObjectivesTo evaluate the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers in reducing lung injury in a ventilator-induced lung injury murine model in short- and longer-term ventilation.Methods5-12 week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 85) were anesthetized, placed on mechanical ventilation for either 2 hrs or 4 hrs with either low tidal volume (8 ml/kg) or high tidal volume (15 ml/kg) with or without positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers.ResultsAlteration of the alveolar-capillary barrier was noted at 2 hrs of high tidal volume ventilation. Standardized histology scores, influx of bronchoalveolar lavage albumin, proinflammatory cytokines, and absolute neutrophils were significantly higher in the high-tidal volume ventilation group at 4 hours of ventilation. Application of positive end-expiratory pressure resulted in significantly decreased standardized histology scores and bronchoalveolar absolute neutrophil counts at low- and high-tidal volume ventilation, respectively. Recruitment maneuvers were essential to maintain pulmonary compliance at both 2 and 4 hrs of ventilation.ConclusionsSigns of ventilator-induced lung injury are evident soon after high tidal volume ventilation (as early as 2 hours) and lung injury worsens with longer-term ventilation (4 hrs). Application of positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers are protective against worsening VILI across all time points. Dynamic compliance can be used guide the frequency of recruitment maneuvers to help ameloriate ventilator-induced lung injury."

While moderate dosages of chemotherapeutic agents such as busulfan may increase hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) engraftment, they are not immune suppressive and do not abrogate immune responses to transgene products. Studies focused on nonmyeloablative conditioning with busulfan Â± fludarabine in a clinically relevant monkey model to induce immune suppression to allow cells expressing a foreign transgene product to persist. Bone marrow CD34+ HSC were transduced in two equal fractions using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-based lentiviral vectors carrying a nonexpressed DNA sequence tag (NoN) and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. Post-transplant there was no evidence of elimination of cells containing the potentially immunogenic GFP gene; several recipients had stable persistence of cells, and no differences were detected with fludarabine, which was rapidly cleared. Antibodies and cellular immune responses to GFP developed in recipients with the highest levels of GFP-marked cells, although these cells were not eliminated. These studies establish a clinically relevant pediatric primate model to assess the effects of conditioning regimens on the engraftment of transduced HSC and the immune responses to cells expressing a foreign gene product."
"MCCURDY, Bill",Stabilizing potentials in bound state analytic continuation methods for electronic resonances in polyatomic molecules,"The computation of Siegert energies by analytic continuation of bound state energies has recently been applied to shape resonances in polyatomic molecules by several authors. We critically evaluate a recently proposed analytic continuation method based on low order (type III) PadÃ© approximants as well as an analytic continuation method based on high order (type II) PadÃ© approximants. We compare three classes of stabilizing potentials: Coulomb potentials, Gaussian potentials, and attenuated Coulomb potentials. These methods are applied to a model potential where the correct answer is known exactly and to the Î g2 shape resonance of N2- which has been studied extensively by other methods. Both the choice of stabilizing potential and method of analytic continuation prove to be important to the accuracy of the results. We conclude that an attenuated Coulomb potential is the most effective of the three for bound state analytic continuation methods. With the proper potential, such methods show promise for algorithmic determination of the positions and widths of molecular shape resonances."
"SWAAB, Tamara Y",Language context processing deficits in schizophrenia: The role of attentional engagement,"Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit problems in language comprehension that are most evident during discourse processing. We hypothesized that deficits in cognitive control contribute to these comprehension deficits during discourse processing, and investigated the underlying cognitive-neural mechanisms using EEG (alpha power) and ERPs (N400). N400 amplitudes to globally supported or unsupported target words near the end of stories were used to index sensitivity to previous context. ERPs showed reduced sensitivity to context in patients versus controls. EEG alpha-band activity was used to index attentional engagement while participants listened to the stories. We found that context effects varied with attentional engagement in both groups, as well as with negative symptom severity in patients. Both groups demonstrated trial-to-trial fluctuations in alpha. Relatively high alpha power was associated with compromised discourse processing in participants with schizophrenia when it occurred during any early portion of the story. In contrast, discourse processing was only compromised in controls when alpha was relatively high for longer segments of the stories. Our results indicate that shifts in attention from the story context may be more detrimental to discourse processing for participants with schizophrenia than for controls, most likely due to an impaired ability to benefit from global context."

In murine arterial myocytes, kinase-dependent mechanisms mediate the increase in CaV1.2 activity in response to increased extracellular glucose. We identified a subpopulation of the CaV1.2 channel pore-forming subunit (Î±1C) within nanometer proximity of protein kinase A (PKA) at the sarcolemma of murine and human arterial myocytes. This arrangement depended upon scaffolding of PKA by an A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150) in mice. Glucose-mediated increases in CaV1.2 channel activity were associated with PKA activity, leading to Î±1C phosphorylation at Ser1928 Compared to arteries from low-fat diet (LFD)-fed mice and nondiabetic patients, arteries from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and from diabetic patients had increased Ser1928 phosphorylation and CaV1.2 activity. Arterial myocytes and arteries from mice lacking AKAP150 or expressing mutant AKAP150 unable to bind PKA did not exhibit increased Ser1928 phosphorylation and CaV1.2 current density in response to increased glucose or to HFD. Consistent with a functional role for Ser1928 phosphorylation, arterial myocytes and arteries from knockin mice expressing a CaV1.2 with Ser1928 mutated to alanine (S1928A) lacked glucose-mediated increases in CaV1.2 activity and vasoconstriction. Furthermore, the HFD-induced increases in CaV1.2 current density and myogenic tone were prevented in S1928A knockin mice. These findings reveal an essential role for Î±1C phosphorylation at Ser1928 in stimulating CaV1.2 channel activity and vasoconstriction by AKAP-targeted PKA upon exposure to increased glucose and in diabetes."
"HOCH, Jeffrey S",Hospitalization cost of conventional psychiatric care compared to broad-spectrum micronutrient treatment: literature review and case study of adult psychosis,"BackgroundHealthcare costs are skyrocketing, with mental health treatment amongst the most expensive, especially when hospitalization is involved. According to the Mental Health Commission of Canada, one in five Canadians is living with a mental disorder in any given year, at an annual cost of $50 billion. In light of this societal burden, alternative approaches are being evaluated, such as brief psychotherapy by phone, peer support, and, as part of the emerging field of nutritional mental health, treatment with micronutrients (minerals and vitamins). Effectiveness of micronutrients has been demonstrated for many types of psychiatric symptoms, in about 45 studies of formulas that are either multinutrient (e.g., several B vitamins) or broad-spectrum (usually over 20 minerals and vitamins). Although this literature demonstrates therapeutic benefits, the potential economic impact of micronutrient treatment has been evaluated in only one case study of childhood psychosis.MethodsThe current case study was initiated to evaluate mental health-related hospitalization costs from 1997 to 2003 for a female adult diagnosed with various mood and psychotic symptoms. She was treated for the first 5&nbsp;years with conventional methods and then subsequently with a broad-spectrum micronutrient formula.ResultsThe patient's annual mental health hospitalization costs during conventional treatment averaged $59,864 across 5&nbsp;years (1997-2001), with a peak annual cost of about $140,000. Since transitioning to broad-spectrum micronutrients, she has incurred no provincial hospitalization costs for mental health care, though her self-funded costs are currently $720/year for the micronutrients.ConclusionFurther exploration of the treatment of mental health problems with broad-spectrum micronutrient formulas has the potential to make two significant contributions: improved mental health, and decreased costs for governments."

Longitudinal data was acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study from phases GO and 2 (2009-2015). ADNI participants included were diagnosed as cognitively normal (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;46), early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;48), late MCI (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;29), and dementia (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;39) at baseline. We modeled the association between dMRI-based global white matter mean diffusivity (MD) and baseline level and change in EF and MEM composite scores, in models controlling for baseline bilateral hippocampal volume, regional cerebral FDG PET metabolism and global cerebral AV45 PET uptake. EF and MEM composite scores were measured at baseline, 6, 12, 24 and 36&nbsp;months. In the baseline late MCI and dementia groups, greater global MD was associated with lesser baseline EF, but not EF change nor MEM baseline or change. As expected, lesser hippocampal volume and lesser FDG PET metabolism was associated with greater rates of EF and MEM decline. In ADNI-GO/2 participants, white matter integrity provided independent information about current executive function, but was not sensitive to future cognitive change. Since individuals experiencing executive function declines progress to dementia more rapidly than those with only memory impairment, better biomarkers of future executive function decline are needed."

Molecular dynamics simulations of the interaction of the AFM tip with the nanostructured carbon confirm the validity of the friction model used for this system. Experimental results show that the friction coefficient is not influenced by the nanostructure of the films nor by the relative humidity.

"MEIER, Alan K",Communicating Power Supplies: Bringing the Internet to the Ubiquitous Energy Gateways of Electronic Devices,"Saving energy in buildings is often hampered by the lack of detailed information about what is using the energy, how much it is using, and how to automatically and remotely control devices. The problem is especially acute for the large number of small, energy-using devices that are present in both residential and commercial buildings. Most of these products use a switching ac to dc power supply to operate electronic and other internal components. We describe a 'communicating power supply' (CPS) to enable the communication of energy and control information between the device and a building management system or other central entities. We developed a proof-of-concept system of Internet-connected CPSs and demonstrated both energy reporting and control utilizing a custom, cloud-based information clearing house. If CPS technology became widespread in devices, a combination of automated and human interactive solutions would enable high levels of energy savings."

Recently, several rare variants have been identified in Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), Triggering Receptor Expressed On Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Unc-5 Netrin Receptor C (UNC5C) that affect risk for AD. Despite the many successes, the genetic architecture of AD remains unsolved. We used Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis to (1) estimate phenotypic variance explained by genetics; (2) calculate genetic variance explained by known AD single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); and (3) identify the genomic locations of variation that explain the remaining unexplained genetic variance. In total, 53.24% of phenotypic variance is explained by genetics, but known AD SNPs only explain 30.62% of the genetic variance. Of the unexplained genetic variance, approximately 41% is explained by unknown SNPs in regions adjacent to known AD SNPs, and the remaining unexplained genetic variance outside these regions."

Comparing costs between healthcare systems can inform evaluation, development or modification of cancer care policies.ObjectivesTo estimate and compare cancer costs in British Columbia and Ontario from the payers' perspectives.MethodsUsing linked cancer registry and administrative data, and standardized costing methodology and analyses, we estimated costs for 21 cancer sites by phase of care to determine potential differences between provinces.ResultsOverall, costs were higher in Ontario. Costs were highest in the initial post-diagnosis and pre-death phases and lowest in the pre-diagnosis and continuing phases, and generally higher for brain cancer and multiple myeloma, and lower for melanoma. Hospitalization was the major cost category. Costs for physician services and diagnostic tests differed the most between provinces.ConclusionsThe standardization of data and costing methodology is challenging, but it enables interprovincial and international comparative costing analyses."

"MAZET, Jonna A",Oiled wildlife care network development for integrated emergency response,"In response to the potential risk to California from oil spill events, the Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act was passed in 1990 requiring the Administrator of the Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response to establish rescue and rehabilitation stations for sea birds, sea otters, and other marine mammals. This legislative mandate for addressing the problems of oiled wildlife care was reaffirmed by three subsequent amendments to the original law. The California Oiled Wildlife Care Newark strives to ensure that wildlife exposed to petroleum products in the environment receive the best achievable treatment by providing access to trained personnel and permanent wildlife rehabilitation facilities which are maintained in a constant state of readiness for oil spill response. This system includes a coordinated effort by federal, state, and local governments; the party responsible for the spill of the oil; and pre-identified non-governmental organizations, such as International Bird Rescue Research Center (IBRRC), specializing in all aspects of oil spill response. In the California system, we have involved representatives from governmental wildlife trustee agencies; universities and research organizations; oil production, transportation, and shipping industries; and wildlife rehabilitation organizations in the organizational structure of the network to ensure an integrated, coordinated, and successful emergency response. Organizations such as IBRRC provide expertise in the rehabilitation of oiled wildlife and the personnel to successfully conduct a spill response. In addition to the development of an organizational structure, crucial to the preparation for an integrated response effort is the pre-identification of wildlife resources at risk. Data on sensitive species can be combined with information on shipping traffic to indicate areas at highest risk of severe wildlife impacts from oil spills in order to target areas requiring the availability of trained volunteers and wildlife rehabilitation facilities. A well-planned response system capitalizes also on existing expertise by developing relationships with wildlife care and response organizations prior to an oil spill event. Key to this effective response system is an annual training program for these partner organizations, incorporating hazardous materials safety information, description of current techniques in oiled wildlife care, and the captive management problems associated with the species at risk of oil exposure. The Oiled Wildlife Care Network must maintain the flow of information within the oil spill response community to ensure that new techniques and technologies are being incorporated into treatment protocols to provide the best achievable treatment for oil-affected wildlife."

"JAMES, Michelle",Breast Radiation Exposure in Female Orthopaedic Surgeons,"BackgroundBreast cancer prevalence is higher among female orthopaedic surgeons compared with U.S. women. The most common breast cancer site, the upper outer quadrant (UOQ), may not be adequately shielded from intraoperative radiation. Factors associated with higher breast radiation exposure (protective apron size and type, surgeon position, and C-arm position) have yet to be established.MethodsAn anthropomorphic torso phantom, simulating the female surgeon, was placed adjacent to a standard operating table. Dosimeters were placed over the UOQ and lower inner quadrant (LIQ) of the breast, bilaterally. Scatter radiation dose-equivalent rates were measured during continuous fluoroscopy to a pelvic phantom (simulating the patient). Four apron sizes (small, medium, large, and extra-large), 2 apron types (cross-back and vest), 2 surgeon positions (facing the table and 90Â° to the table), and 2 C-arm positions (anteroposterior and cross-table lateral projection) were tested.ResultsThe median dose-equivalent rate of scatter radiation to the UOQ (0.40 mrem/hr) was higher than that to the LIQ of the breast (0.06 mrem/hr) across all testing, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.05). The cross-back aprons provided higher protection to the LIQ compared with the vests (p < 0.05). Lead protection in sizes that were too small or too large for the torso had higher breast radiation dose-equivalent rates. C-arm cross-table lateral projection was associated with higher breast radiation exposure (0.98 mrem/hr) compared with anteroposterior projection (0.13 mrem/hr) (p < 0.001).ConclusionsBreast radiation exposure is higher in a C-arm lateral projection compared with an anteroposterior projection. Higher dose-equivalent rates were observed for the UOQ compared with the LIQ of the breast and for aprons that were too small or too large, although these differences did not reach significance. Factors that may reduce radiation exposure include lead protection of appropriate size and distancing the axilla from the patient and x-ray tube.Clinical relevanceIncreased breast cancer prevalence has been reported for female orthopaedic surgeons. The UOQ of the breast may be at risk for intraoperative radiation exposure. Methods of reducing exposure are warranted."

While such technologies promise to address many of our most serious problems, they also bring environmental and health-related risks and uncertainties. Moreover, they can come to dominate global production systems and markets with very little public input or awareness. Existing governance institutions and processes do not adequately address the risks of new technologies, nor do they give much consideration to the concerns of persons affected by them. Instead of treating technology, health, and the environment as discrete issues, Albert C. Lin argues, laws must acknowledge their fundamental relationship, anticipating both future technological developments and their potential adverse effects. Further, laws must encourage international cooperation and the development of common global standards, while allowing for flexibility and reassessment."

This model was constructed through the parameter-space minimization of a regularized least-squares objective function via the ForceBalance method. The objective function was computed using a training set of experimental bilayer area per lipid and deuterium order parameter. This model was validated by comparison to experimental volume per lipid, X-ray scattering form factor, thermal area expansivity, area compressibility modulus, and lipid lateral diffusion coefficient. These comparisons demonstrate that gb-fb15 is robust to temperature variation and an improvement over the original model for both the training and validation properties."

"JURKOVICH, Gregory J",The clinical significance of endotoxin released by antibiotics: What is the evidence?,"Basic investigations indicate variation among antibiotics in their propensity to release endotoxin from bacterial cells. Evidence for the clinical significance of this phenomenon includes: anecdotal reports; studies evaluating changes in endotoxin levels in response to antibiotics in a variety of infectious diseases; two studies which have prospectively evaluated changes in endotoxin levels in response to different antibiotics and correlated the changes with the patients' clinical course; and one study which evaluated differences in mortality in injured patients based on the endotoxin-releasing potential of antibiotics they received. These studies suggest: (i) different types of antibiotics do induce differing levels of endotoxin release during treatment of bacterial infections in humans; (ii) such antibiotic-associated endotoxin release probably does have a biologic consequence; and (iii) this biologic consequence is possibly of clinical relevance. However, the data are not sufficient to advocate changes in current antibiotic prescribing or dosing decisions. Rather, a variety of in vitro and in vivo experiments as well as clinical studies are advocated. Â© pearson professional Ltd 1996."
"JURKOVICH, Gregory J",The shape of things to come: results from a national survey of trauma surgeons on issues concerning their future.,"BACKGROUND: This study seeks to characterize the opinions of practicing surgeons as a basis for formulating a plan to restructure the discipline of trauma surgery and its training path. METHODS: A 52-item questionnaire was administered to the membership of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma, and the Western Trauma Association. The survey tool investigated issues related to current and future practice. RESULTS: Response rate was 60%. Mean age was 49 years and 88% were male. The average time in practice is 15 years. The average workweek is 80 hours with 48% of that time devoted to clinical practice. About half take in-house call and about one-third receive an on-call stipend. The median annual number of major trauma cases was 50. The most important disincentives to entering the field were felt to be lifestyle issues and a limited scope of practice. Almost 90% felt their work as trauma surgeons was undervalued by society and the health care system. The great majority (88%) responded that the discipline of trauma surgery must change. Respondents feel this restructuring should include broader general surgery (83%) as well as limited orthopedic (60%) and neurosurgical trauma-related procedures (59%). About one-half of respondents favored in-house call (54%) and a practice model similar to emergency medicine (55%). Factors that would most enhance practice were thought to be guaranteed appropriate salary and guaranteed time away from work. Training in a broad range of skills was felt to be essential or useful to the trauma surgeon of the future, although few currently employ such a wide breadth of skills. CONCLUSIONS: Current practicing trauma surgeons feel that the discipline must change to remain viable. This change should entail broader training to allow more procedures in trauma, emergency surgery, critical care, and elective general surgery. The preferred practice model is a large, hospital-based, diversified group practice with a predictable lifestyle and guaranteed salary commensurate with effort. Inclusion of selected emergency orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures are viewed favorably, as is in-house call. Efforts to increase public perception of trauma surgery's value to society and its impending demise are warranted."

One way to assist in achieving these goals is to integrate beneficial plant microbiomes-i.e., those enhancing plant growth, nutrient use efficiency, abiotic stress tolerance, and disease resistance-into agricultural production. This integration will require a large-scale effort among academic researchers, industry researchers, and farmers to understand and manage plant-microbiome interactions in the context of modern agricultural systems. Here, we identify priorities for research in this area: (1) develop model host-microbiome systems for crop plants and non-crop plants with associated microbial culture collections and reference genomes, (2) define core microbiomes and metagenomes in these model systems, (3) elucidate the rules of synthetic, functionally programmable microbiome assembly, (4) determine functional mechanisms of plant-microbiome interactions, and (5) characterize and refine plant genotype-by-environment-by-microbiome-by-management interactions. Meeting these goals should accelerate our ability to design and implement effective agricultural microbiome manipulations and management strategies, which, in turn, will pay dividends for both the consumers and producers of the world food supply."

"HARVEY, Danielle J",From the Cover: MagneticResonance Imaging Reveals Progressive Brain Injury in Rats Acutely Intoxicated With Diisopropylfluorophosphate,"Acute intoxication with organophosphates (OPs) can trigger seizures that progress to status epilepticus, and survivors often exhibit chronic neuropathology, cognitive impairment, affective disorders, and/or electroencephalographic abnormalities. Understanding how acute injury transitions to persistent neurological sequelae is critical to developing medical countermeasures for mitigating damage following OP-induced seizures. Here, we used in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor the spatiotemporal patterns of neuropathology for 1 month after acute intoxication with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Adult male Sprague Dawley rats administered pyridostigmine bromide (0.1â€‰mg/kg, im) 30â€‰min prior to successive administration of DFP (4â€‰mg/kg, sc), atropine sulfate (2â€‰mg/kg, im), and 2-pralidoxime (25â€‰mg/kg, im) exhibited moderate-to-severe seizure behavior. T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR imaging prior to DFP exposure and at 3, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days postexposure revealed prominent lesions, tissue atrophy, and ventricular enlargement in discrete brain regions. Lesions varied in intensity and/or extent over time, with the overall magnitude of injury strongly influenced by seizure severity. Importantly, lesions detected by MRI correlated spatially and temporally with histological evidence of brain pathology. Analysis of histogram parameters extracted from frequency distributions of regional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values identified the standard deviation and 90th percentile of the ADC as robust metrics for quantifying persistent and progressive neuropathological changes. The interanimal and interregional variations observed in lesion severity and progression, coupled with potential reinjury following spontaneous recurrent seizures, underscore the advantages of using in vivo imaging to longitudinally monitor neuropathology and, ultimately, therapeutic response, following acute OP intoxication."

We identify halo stars kinematically as moving at a relative speed of at least 220 km s-1 with respect to the local standard of rest. These stars are generally less metal-rich than the disk, but surprisingly, half of our halo sample is comprised of stars with [Fe H] >-1. The orbital directions of these metal-rich halo stars are preferentially aligned with the disk rotation, in sharp contrast with the intrinsically isotropic orbital distribution of the metal-poor halo stars. We find similar properties in the Latte cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy from the FIRE project. In Latte, metal-rich halo stars formed primarily inside of the solar circle, whereas lower-metallicity halo stars preferentially formed at larger distances (extending beyond the virial radius). This suggests that metal-rich halo stars in the solar neighborhood actually formed in situ within the Galactic disk, rather than having been accreted from satellite systems. These stars, currently on halo-like orbits, therefore have likely undergone substantial radial migration/heating."
"DECARLI, Charles",Relationship between carotid arterial properties and cerebral white matter hyperintensities,"ObjectiveSince arterial stiffness is a functional measure of arterial compliance and may be an important marker of cerebrovascular disease, we examined the association of carotid artery stiffness with white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) in a cross-sectional study of 1,166 stroke-free participants.MethodsCarotid beta stiffness index (STIFF) was assessed by M-mode ultrasound of the common carotid artery and calculated as the ratio of natural log of the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure over STRAIN, a ratio of the difference between carotid systolic and diastolic diameter (DD) divided by DD. WMHV was measured by fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI. The associations of STIFF, DD, and STRAIN with WMHV were examined using linear regression after adjusting for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and vascular risk factors.ResultsIn a fully adjusted model, larger carotid DD was significantly associated with greater log-WMHV (Î² = 0.09, p = 0.001). STIFF and STRAIN were not significantly associated with WMHV. In adjusted analyses stratified by race-ethnicity, STRAIN (Î² = -1.78, p = 0.002) and DD (Î² = 0.11, p = 0.001) were both associated with greater log-WMHV among Hispanic participants, but not among black or white participants.ConclusionsLarge carotid artery diameters are associated with greater burden of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in this multiethnic population. The association between increased diameters, decreased STRAIN, and greater WMH burden is more pronounced among Hispanics. These associations suggest a potential important pathophysiologic role of extracranial large artery remodeling in the burden of WMH."

"MURPHY, William J",Differential phenotypes of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells in the spleen and peripheral tissues following immunostimulatory therapy,"BackgroundStudies assessing immune parameters typically utilize human PBMCs or murine splenocytes to generate data that is interpreted as representative of immune status. Using splenocytes, we have shown memory CD4-T cells that expand following systemic immunostimulatory therapies undergo rapid IFNg-mediated activation induced cell death (AICD) resulting in a net loss of total CD4-T cells which correlates with elevated PD-1 expression. This is in contrast to CD8-T cells which expand with minimal PD-1 upregulation and apoptosis. In this study we expand upon our previous work by evaluating CD4 and CD8-T cell phenotype and distribution in peripheral organs which are more representative of immune responses occurring at metastatic sites following immunotherapy.MethodsPhenotypic assessment of T cells in both lymphoid (spleen and LN) as well as peripheral organs (liver and lungs) in control and immunotherapy treated mice was performed to survey the impact of location on memory phenotype and activation marker status. Peripheral blood from patients undergoing systemic high dose IL-2 was also assessed for expression of PD-1 and memory phenotype.ResultsHere we reveal that, similar to what occurs in the spleen and lymph nodes, CD4-T cell numbers decreased while CD8-T cells expanded at these peripheral sites. In contrast to having differential expression of PD-1 as occurs in the spleen, both CD4 and CD8-T cells had significantly elevated levels of PD-1 in both the liver and lungs. Further analysis correlated PD-1 expression to CD62Llow (T effector/effector memory,TE/EM) expression which are more prevalent in CD4-T cells in general as well as CD8-T cells in peripheral organs. Similar elevated PD-1 expression on TE/EM cells was observed in patients undergoing systemic high-dose IL-2 therapy.ConclusionsThese data highlight PD-1 expressing and/or TE/EM subsets of T cells in circulation as more representative of cells at immune sites and underscore the importance of valuation both in lymphoid as well as target organs when making determinations about immune status.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT01416831.

A control diet (CD) and Western diet (WD), which contains high fat and carbohydrate, were used to feed wild type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) mice followed by phenotyping characterization as well as BA and microbiota profiling. Our data revealed that male WD-fed FXR KO mice had the most severe steatosis and highest hepatic and serum lipids as well as insulin resistance among the eight studied groups. Gender differences in WD-induced steatosis, insulin sensitivity, and predicted microbiota functions were all FXR-dependent. FXR deficiency enriched Desulfovibrionaceae, Deferribacteraceae, and Helicobacteraceae, which were accompanied by increased hepatic taurine-conjugated cholic acid and Î²-muricholic acid as well as hepatic and serum lipids. Additionally, distinct microbiota profiles were found in WD-fed WT mice harboring simple steatosis and CD-fed FXR KO mice, in which the steatosis had a potential to develop into liver cancer. Together, the presented data revealed FXR-dependent concomitant relationships between gut microbiota, BAs, and metabolic diseases in both genders. Gender differences in BAs and microbiota may account for gender dissimilarity in metabolism and metabolic diseases."

Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a cytosolic enzyme whose genetic deficiency and pharmacological inhibition have beneficial effects on renal function, but its role in podocytes remains unexplored. The objective of this study was to investigate the contribution of sEH in podocytes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced kidney injury. We report increased sEH transcript and protein expression in murine podocytes upon LPS challenge. To determine the function of sEH in podocytes in&nbsp;vivo we generated podocyte-specific sEH-deficient (pod-sEHKO) mice. Following LPS challenge, podocyte sEH-deficient mice exhibited lower kidney injury, proteinuria, and blood urea nitrogen concentrations than controls suggestive of preserved renal function. Also, renal mRNA and serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1Î², and TNFÎ± were significantly lower in LPS-treated pod-sEHKO than control mice. Moreover, podocyte sEH deficiency was associated with decreased LPS-induced NF-ÎºB and MAPK activation and attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, the protective effects of podocyte sEH deficiency in&nbsp;vivo were recapitulated in E11 murine podocytes treated with a selective sEH pharmacological inhibitor. Altogether, these findings identify sEH in podocytes as a contributor to signaling events in acute renal injury and suggest that sEH inhibition may be of therapeutic value in proteinuria.EnzymesSoluble epoxide hydrolase: EC 3.3.2.10."

Once an ulcerative dose of DCF was chosen, mice were pretreated with TPPU for 7days at 0.1mg/kg to evaluate anti-ulcer effects of the sEH inhibitor on anatomy, histopathology, pH, inflammatory markers and epithelial apoptosis of stomachs.Key findingsDiclofenac caused ulceration of the stomach at a dose of 100mg/kg and a time post dose of 6h. Ulcers generated under these conditions were associated with a significant increase in the levels of TNF-Î± and IL-6 in serum and increased apoptosis compared to control mice. Pretreatment with TPPU resulted in a decrease of ulceration in mice treated with DCF with a significant decrease in the level of apoptosis, TNF-Î± and IL-6 in the serum in comparison to diclofenac-treated mice. TPPU did not affect the pH of the stomach, whereas omeprazole elevated the pH of the stomach as expected. A similar anti-ulcer effect was observed in sEH gene knockout mice treated with DCF.SignificanceThe sEH inhibitor TPPU decreases the NSAID-induced stomach ulcers."

Averaged over all compartments, DM subjects showed significantly higher texture parameters (variance, P = 0.001; contrast, P = 0.002; entropy, P < 0.001). Subjects with severe DM additionally showed higher T2 in the medial tibial deep and superficial layers (P = 0.011 and P = 0.041) compared to controls. No significant differences in cartilage, meniscus, and overall WORMS were found between the groups (P > 0.05).ConclusionIn comparison to nondiabetic controls, cartilage in DM subjects showed higher and more heterogeneous cartilage T2 values, indicating increased articular cartilage degeneration. This affected even more compartments in subjects with severe DM.Level of evidence2 Technical Efficacy: 5 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2018;47:380-390."
"KURZROCK, Eric",The Current Use of Stem Cells in Bladder Tissue Regeneration and Bioengineering,"Many pathological processes including neurogenic bladder and malignancy necessitate bladder reconstruction, which is currently performed using intestinal tissue. The use of intestinal tissue, however, subjects patients to metabolic abnormalities, bladder stones, and other long-term sequelae, raising the need for a source of safe and reliable bladder tissue. Advancements in stem cell biology have catapulted stem cells to the center of many current tissue regeneration and bioengineering strategies. This review presents the recent advancements in the use of stem cells in bladder tissue bioengineering."

In addition, certain translocations are more commonly seen in MDS than others, but to our knowledge, the presence of t(6;15) has not been reported in MDS, specifically therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) cases. Patients with t-MDS, a group of heterogeneous stem cell related disorders resulting as a latent complication of cytotoxic and/or radiation therapy, generally tend to have a poorer prognosis than de novo MDS. We present a unique case of a patient who initially presented with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a normal karyotype and FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations. The patient was successfully treated with chemotherapy and an autologous bone marrow transplant but subsequently developed a new FLT3-ITD negative t-MDS with a unique translocation, t(6;15)(q12;q15), three years after transplant. To our knowledge, this unique sole translocation has never been reported in MDS or t-MDS and given her successful response to treatment and remission, presence of this translocation may have some prognostic value."

"ZACCARIA, Daniele",Evapotranspiration Estimate over an Almond Orchard Using Landsat Satellite Observations,"California growers face challenges with water shortages and there is a strong need to use the least amount of water while optimizing yield. Timely information on evapotranspiration (ET), a dominant component of crop consumptive water use, is critical for growers to tailor irrigation management based on in-field spatial variability and in-season variations.We evaluated the performance of a remote sensing-based approach, Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), in mapping ET over an almond orchard in California, driven by Landsat satellite observations. Reference ET from a network of weather stations over well-watered grass (ETo) was used for the internal calibration and for deriving ET at daily and extended time period, instead of alfalfa based reference evapotranspiration (ETr). Our study showed that METRIC daily ET estimates during Landsat overpass dates agreed well with the field measurements. During 2009-2012, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.53 mm/day and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.87 were found between METRIC versus observed daily ET. Monthly ET estimates had a higher accuracy, with a RMSE of 12.08 mm/month, a R2 of 0.90, and a relatively small relative mean difference (RMD) of 9.68% during 2009-2012 growing seasons. Net radiation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from remote sensing observations were highly correlated with spatial and temporal ET estimates. An empirical model was developed to estimate daily ET using NDVI, net radiation (Rn), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The validation showed that the accuracy of this easy-to-use empirical method was slightly lower than that of METRIC but still reasonable, with a RMSE of 0.71 mm/day when compared to ground measurements. The remote sensing based ET estimate will support a variety of State and local interests in water use and irrigation management, for both planning and regulatory/compliance purposes, and it provides the farmers observation-based guidance for site-specific and time-sensitive irrigation management."

This requires an understanding of ecological resilience: the ability of an ecosystem to return to the same state following a perturbation, which can strongly depend on species interactions across trophic levels. We use a structured model of a temperate rocky reef to explore how multi-trophic level fisheries impact ecological resilience. Increasing fishing mortality of prey (urchins) has a minor effect on equilibrium biomass of kelp, urchins, and spiny lobster predators, but increases resilience by reducing the range of predator harvest rates at which alternative stable states are possible. Size-structured predation on urchins acts as the feedback maintaining each state. Our results demonstrate that the resilience of ecosystems strongly depends on the interactive effects of predator and prey harvest in multi-trophic level fisheries, which are common in marine ecosystems but are unaccounted for by traditional management."
"MARTINEZ LOPEZ, Beatriz",Modeling the live-pig trade network in Georgia: Implications for disease prevention and control,"Live pig trade patterns, drivers and characteristics, particularly in backyard predominant systems, remain largely unexplored despite their important contribution to the spread of infectious diseases in the swine industry. A better understanding of the pig trade dynamics can inform the implementation of risk-based and more cost-effective prevention and control programs for swine diseases. In this study, a semi-structured questionnaire elaborated by FAO and implemented to 487 farmers was used to collect data regarding basic characteristics about pig demographics and live-pig trade among villages in the country of Georgia, where very scarce information is available. Social network analysis and exponential random graph models were used to better understand the structure, contact patterns and main drivers for pig trade in the country. Results indicate relatively infrequent (a total of 599 shipments in one year) and geographically localized (median Euclidean distance between shipments = 6.08 km; IQR = 0-13.88 km) pig movements in the studied regions. The main factors contributing to live-pig trade movements among villages were being from the same region (i.e., local trade), usage of a middleman or a live animal market to trade live pigs by at least one farmer in the village, and having a large number of pig farmers in the village. The identified villages' characteristics and structural network properties could be used to inform the design of more cost-effective surveillance systems in a country which pig industry was recently devastated by African swine fever epidemics and where backyard production systems are predominant."

"CREININ, Mitchell D",Randomised controlled trial of levonorgestrel versus the Yuzpe regimen of combined oral contraceptives for emergency contraception,"BackgroundA previous randomised study suggested that the progestagen, levonorgestrel, given alone in two separate doses each of 0.75 mg caused nausea and vomiting in fewer women and might be more effective than the Yuzpe regimen of combined oral contraceptives for emergency contraception, although the difference was not significant. We compared these two regimens when started within 72 h of unprotected coitus.MethodsWe enrolled in the double-blind, randomised trial 1998 women at 21 centres worldwide. Women with regular menses, not using hormonal contraception, and requesting emergency contraception after one unprotected coitus, received levonorgestrel (0.75 mg, repeated 12 h later) or the Yuzpe regimen (ethinyloestradiol 100 microg plus levonorgestrel 0.5 mg, repeated 12 h later).FindingsOutcome was unknown for 43 women (25 assigned levonorgestrel, 18 assigned Yuzpe regimen). Among the remaining 1955 women, the crude pregnancy rate was 1.1% (11/976) in the levonorgestrel group compared with 3.2% (31/979) in the Yuzpe regimen group. The crude relative risk of pregnancy for levonorgestrel compared with the Yuzpe regimen was 0.36 (95% CI 0.18-0.70). The proportion of pregnancies prevented (compared with the expected number without treatment) was 85% (74-93) with the levonorgestrel regimen and 57% (39-71) with the Yuzpe regimen. Nausea (23.1 vs 50.5%) and vomiting (5.6 vs 18.8%) were significantly less frequent with the levonorgestrel regimen than with the Yuzpe regimen (p<0.01). The efficacy of both treatments declined with increasing time since unprotected coitus (p=0.01).InterpretationThe levonorgestrel regimen was better tolerated and more effective than the current standard in hormonal emergency contraception. With either regimen, the earlier the treatment is given, the more effective it seems to be."

It is also the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the United States. An estimated 20 million persons are currently infected with the virus, with an estimated 6 million new infections occurring annually and 12,000 new cervical cancer cases and 4,000 cervical cancer deaths annually. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is thus an especially important preventive measure for racial/ethnic groups who bear an unequal burden of cervical cancer mortality.PurposeThis study aimed to develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate intervention to educate and empower Latino and Korean Americans to make an informed HPV vaccination decision for their minor children.MethodsA parent-focused HPV vaccine education DVD was developed through focus groups and cognitive interviews with Latino and Korean Americans parents of children ages 11-17. A randomized controlled efficacy trial was subsequently conducted with 708 Latino and Korean Americans parents to assess knowledge gains, decisional conflict, decision self-efficacy and informed decision-making resulting from viewing the intervention DVD.ResultsDifferences between treatment and control groups for pre-post changes in knowledge, informed decision-making and decisional conflict were statistically significant among the parents exposed to the education intervention DVD.ConclusionThe study demonstrated that a culturally and linguistically appropriate intervention DVD designed to educate parents about the risks and benefits of the HPV vaccine promoted informed decision-making regarding HPV vaccination among at-risk populations."

"CARTER, Cameron S","Oxytocin and Vasopressin Are Dysregulated in Williams Syndrome, a Genetic Disorder Affecting Social Behavior","The molecular and neural mechanisms regulating human social-emotional behaviors are fundamentally important but largely unknown; unraveling these requires a genetic systems neuroscience analysis of human models. Williams Syndrome (WS), a condition caused by deletion of ~28 genes, is associated with a gregarious personality, strong drive to approach strangers, difficult peer interactions, and attraction to music. WS provides a unique opportunity to identify endogenous human gene-behavior mechanisms. Social neuropeptides including oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) regulate reproductive and social behaviors in mammals, and we reasoned that these might mediate the features of WS. Here we established blood levels of OT and AVP in WS and controls at baseline, and at multiple timepoints following a positive emotional intervention (music), and a negative physical stressor (cold). We also related these levels to standardized indices of social behavior. Results revealed significantly higher median levels of OT in WS versus controls at baseline, with a less marked increase in AVP. Further, in WS, OT and AVP increased in response to music and to cold, with greater variability and an amplified peak release compared to controls. In WS, baseline OT but not AVP, was correlated positively with approach, but negatively with adaptive social behaviors. These results indicate that WS deleted genes perturb hypothalamic-pituitary release not only of OT but also of AVP, implicating more complex neuropeptide circuitry for WS features and providing evidence for their roles in endogenous regulation of human social behavior. The data suggest a possible biological basis for amygdalar involvement, for increased anxiety, and for the paradox of increased approach but poor social relationships in WS. They also offer insight for translating genetic and neuroendocrine knowledge into treatments for disorders of social behavior."

Studying metabolism is inherently challenging due to metabolites' reactivity, structural diversity, and broad concentration range. Herein, we review the common pitfalls encountered in metabolomics and provide concrete guidelines for obtaining accurate metabolite measurements, focusing on water-soluble primary metabolites. We show how seemingly straightforward sample preparation methods can introduce systematic errors (e.g., owing to interconversion among metabolites) and how proper selection of quenching solvent (e.g., acidic acetonitrile:methanol:water) can mitigate such problems. We discuss the specific strengths, pitfalls, and best practices for each common analytical platform: liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and enzyme assays. Together this information provides a pragmatic knowledge base for carrying out biologically informative metabolite measurements."
"MAZET, Jonna A",Global patterns in coronavirus diversity.,"Since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrom Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) it has become increasingly clear that bats are important reservoirs of CoVs. Despite this, only 6% of all CoV sequences in GenBank are from bats. The remaining 94% largely consist of known pathogens of public health or agricultural significance, indicating that current research effort is heavily biased towards describing known diseases rather than the 'pre-emergent' diversity in bats. Our study addresses this critical gap, and focuses on resource poor countries where the risk of zoonotic emergence is believed to be highest. We surveyed the diversity of CoVs in multiple host taxa from twenty countries to explore the factors driving viral diversity at a global scale. We identified sequences representing 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters, ninety-one of which were found in bats, and used ecological and epidemiologic analyses to show that patterns of CoV diversity correlate with those of bat diversity. This cements bats as the major evolutionary reservoirs and ecological drivers of CoV diversity. Co-phylogenetic reconciliation analysis was also used to show that host switching has contributed to CoV evolution, and a preliminary analysis suggests that regional variation exists in the dynamics of this process. Overall our study represents a model for exploring global viral diversity and advances our fundamental understanding of CoV biodiversity and the potential risk factors associated with zoonotic emergence."
"BRITT, R. David",Copper Binding Sites in the Manganese-Oxidizing Mnx Protein Complex Investigated by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,"Manganese-oxide minerals (MnOx) are widely distributed over the Earth's surface, and their geochemical cycling is globally important. A multicopper oxidase (MCO) MnxG protein from marine Bacillus bacteria plays an essential role in producing MnOx minerals by oxidizing Mn2+(aq) at rates that are 3 to 5 orders of magnitude faster than abiotic rates. The MnxG protein is isolated as part of a multiprotein complex denoted as ""Mnx"" that includes accessory protein subunits MnxE and MnxF, with an estimated stoichiometry of MnxE3F3G and corresponding molecular weight of â‰ˆ211 kDa. Herein, we report successful expression and isolation of the MCO MnxG protein without the E3F3 hexamer. This isolated MnxG shows activity for Mn2+(aq) oxidation to form manganese oxides. The complement of paramagnetic Cu(II) ions in the Mnx protein complex was examined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Two distinct classes of type 2 Cu sites were detected. One class of Cu(II) site (denoted as T2Cu-A), located in the MnxG subunit, is identified by the magnetic parameters gâˆ¥ = 2.320 and Aâˆ¥ = 510 MHz. The other class of Cu(II) sites (denoted as T2Cu-B) is characterized by gâˆ¥ = 2.210 and Aâˆ¥ = 615 MHz and resides in the putative hexameric MnxE3F3 subunit. These different magnetic properties correlate with the differences in the reduction potentials of the respective Cu(II) centers. These studies provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of manganese biomineralization."
"MURPHY, William J","Therapeutic Efficacy of Fresh, Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Severe Refractory Feline Chronic Gingivostomatitis","Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have potent immunomodulatory functions and are a promising therapy for immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of fresh, autologous, adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) to treat feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS), a chronic oral mucosal inflammatory disease similar to human oral lichen planus. Here, we investigate the use of fresh allogeneic ASCs for treatment of FCGS in seven cats. Radiolabeled ASCs were also tracked systemically. Each cat received two intravenous injections of 20 million ASCs, 1 month apart. Oral inflammation, blood lymphocyte subsets, anti-fetal bovine serum antibody levels, ASC crossmatching and serum proteins and cytokine concentrations were determined. Four of the 7 cats (57%) responded to treatment [complete clinical remission (nâ€‰=â€‰2) or substantial clinical improvement (nâ€‰=â€‰2)]. Three cats were nonresponders. Prior to therapy, most cats had increased circulating CD8+ T cells, decreased CD8lo cells, and a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio, however clinical resolution was not associated with normalization of these parameters. Nonresponders showed more severe systemic inflammation (neutrophilia, hyperglobulinemia and increased interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentration) prior to ASC therapy. Clinical remission took up to 20 months and no clinical relapse has occurred. A higher fraction of radiolabeled ASCs were identified in the oral cavity of FCGS affected cats than the control cat. The administration of fresh, allogenic ASCs appeared to have lower clinical efficacy with a delayed response as compared to the fresh, autologous ASCs. In addition, the mechanism(s) of action for autologous and allogenic ASCs may differ in this model of oral inflammation. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2017;6:1710-1722."

A total of 42 dogs were identified, in which 36 received treatment and had follow-up information available. The most common clinical signs included lethargy, anorexia and polyuria/polydipsia. Hypercalcemia and pleural effusion were common findings at diagnosis. The phenotype was almost exclusively T-cell, most often in association with lymphoblastic cytomorphology as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) lymphoma classification scheme. The overall progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 133 and 183â€‰days, respectively. Treatment with a CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) protocol was associated with an improved PFS (144â€‰days) and OS (194â€‰days) when compared with dogs that received other medical therapies (Pâ€‰=â€‰.005 and Pâ€‰=â€‰.002, respectively); the absence of pleural effusion at diagnosis was associated with an increased OS but not PFS. These results suggest that while the prognosis for dogs with mediastinal lymphoma is poor, survival may be improved with treatment using a CHOP-based protocol."

This study sought to validate a paper-disk approach to help evaluate bitterness in NaCaHs and to develop a food-grade approach to separate a NaCaH into distinct fractions, which could be evaluated by a sensory panel. Membrane filtration generated <0.2-Î¼m and <3-kDa permeates. Further fractionation of the <3-kDa permeate by flash-chromatography generated four fractions using ethanol (EtOH) concentrations of 5, 10, 30 and 50%. As some fractions were poorly soluble in water, the fractions were resolubilzed in EtOH and impregnated into paper-disks for sensory evaluation. Bitterness differences observed in the membrane fractions using this sensory evaluation approach reflected those observed for the same fractions presented as a liquid. The flash-chromatography fractions increased in bitterness with an increase in hydrophobicity, except for the 50% EtOH fraction which had little bitterness. Amino acid analysis of the fractions showed enrichment of different essential amino acids in both the bitter and less bitter fractions. The developed food-grade fractionation system, allowed for a simple and reasonably scaled approach to separating a NaCaH, into physicochemically different fractions that could be evaluated by a sensory panel. The method of sensory evaluation used in this study, in which NaCaH samples are impregnated into paper-disks, provided potential solutions for issues such as sample insolubility and limited quantities of sample. As the impregnated paper-disk samples were dehydrated, their long storage life could also be suitable for sensory evaluations distributed by mail for large consumer studies. The research, in this study, allowed for a greater understanding of the physicochemical basis for bitterness in this NaCaH. As some essential amino acids were enriched in the less bitter fractions, selective removal of bitter fractions could allow for the incorporation of the less bitter NaCaH fractions into food products for added nutritional value, without negatively impacting sensory properties. There is potential for this approach to be applied to other food ingredients with undesirable tastes, such as polyphenols."

"NAPOLI, Eleonora",Evidence of reactive oxygen species-mediated damage to mitochondrial DNA in children with typical autism,"Abstract Background The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is particularly susceptible to damage mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although elevated ROS production and elevated biomarkers of oxidative stress have been found in tissues from children with autism spectrum disorders, evidence for damage to mtDNA is lacking. Findings mtDNA deletions were evaluated in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMC) isolated from 2â€“5 year old children with full autism (AU; n = 67), and typically developing children (TD; n = 46) and their parents enrolled in the CHildhood Autism Risk from Genes and Environment study (CHARGE) at University of California Davis. Sequence variants were evaluated in mtDNA segments from AU and TD children (n = 10; each) and their mothers representing 31.2% coverage of the entire human mitochondrial genome. Increased mtDNA damage in AU children was evidenced by (i) higher frequency of mtDNA deletions (2-fold), (ii) higher number of GCâ†’AT transitions (2.4-fold), being GC preferred sites for oxidative damage, and (iii) higher frequency of G,C,Tâ†’A transitions (1.6-fold) suggesting a higher incidence of polymerase gamma incorporating mainly A at bypassed apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, probably originated from oxidative stress. The last two outcomes were identical to their mothers suggesting the inheritance of a template consistent with increased oxidative damage, whereas the frequency of mtDNA deletions in AU children was similar to that of their fathers. Conclusions These results suggest that a combination of genetic and epigenetic factors, taking place during perinatal periods, results in a mtDNA template in children with autism similar to that expected for older individuals."

"LANE, Nancy E","Targeted spine strengthening exercise and posture training program to reduce hyperkyphosis in older adults: results from the study of hyperkyphosis, exercise, and function (SHEAF) randomized controlled trial","A 6-month randomized controlled trial of spine-strengthening exercise and posture training reduced both radiographic and clinical measures of kyphosis. Participants receiving the intervention improved self-image and satisfaction with their appearance. Results suggest that spine-strengthening exercise and postural training may be an effective treatment option for older adults with hyperkyphosis.IntroductionThe purpose of the present study is to determine in a randomized controlled trial whether spine-strengthening exercises improve Cobb angle of kyphosis in community-dwelling older adults.MethodsWe recruited adults â‰¥60&nbsp;years with kyphosis â‰¥40Â° and enrolled 99 participants (71 women, 28 men), mean age 70.6&nbsp;Â±&nbsp;0.6&nbsp;years, range 60-88, with baseline Cobb angle 57.4&nbsp;Â±&nbsp;12.5Â°. The intervention included group spine-strengthening exercise and postural training, delivered by a physical therapist, 1-h, three times weekly for 6&nbsp;months. Controls received four group health education meetings. The primary outcome was change in the gold standard Cobb angle of kyphosis measured from standing lateral spine radiographs. Secondary outcomes included change in kyphometer-measured kyphosis, physical function (modified Physical Performance Test, gait speed, Timed Up and Go, Timed Loaded Standing, 6-Min Walk), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (PROMIS global health and physical function indexes, SRS-30 self-image domain). ANCOVA was used to assess treatment effects on change from baseline to 6&nbsp;months in all outcomes.ResultsThere was a -3.0Â° (95% CI -5.2, -0.8) between-group difference in change in Cobb angle, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.009, favoring the intervention and approximating the magnitude of change from an incident vertebral fracture. Kyphometer-measured kyphosis (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.03) and SRS-30 self-esteem (p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001) showed favorable between-group differences in change, with no group differences in physical function or additional HRQoL outcomes, p&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.05.ConclusionsSpine-strengthening exercise and posture training over 6&nbsp;months reduced kyphosis compared to control. Our randomized controlled trial results suggest that a targeted kyphosis-specific exercise program may be an effective treatment option for older adults with hyperkyphosis.Trial registration number and name of trial registerClinicalTrials.gov; identifier NCT01751685."

"SOLOMON, Marjorie",In pursuit of neurophenotypes: The consequences of having autism and a big brain,"A consensus has emerged that despite common core features, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has multiple etiologies and various genetic and biological characteristics. The fact that there are likely to be subtypes of ASD has complicated attempts to develop effective therapies. The UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project is a longitudinal, multidisciplinary analysis of children with autism and age-matched typically developing controls; nearly 400 families are participating in this study. The overarching goal is to gather sufficient biological, medical, and behavioral data to allow definition of clinically meaningful subtypes of ASD. One reasonable hypothesis is that different subtypes of autism will demonstrate different patterns of altered brain organization or development i.e., different neurophenotypes. In this Commentary, we discuss one neurophenotype that is defined by megalencephaly, or having brain size that is large and disproportionate to body size. We have found that 15% of the boys with autism demonstrate this neurophenotype, though it is far less common in girls. We review behavioral and medical characteristics of the large-brained group of boys with autism in comparison to those with typically sized brains. While brain size in typically developing individuals is positively correlated with cognitive function, the children with autism and larger brains have more severe disabilities and poorer prognosis. This research indicates that phenotyping in autism, like genotyping, requires a very substantial cohort of subjects. Moreover, since brain and behavior relationships may emerge at different times during development, this effort highlights the need for longitudinal analyses to carry out meaningful phenotyping.

"WANG, Jun Y",Open-Label Allopregnanolone Treatment of Men with Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome,"Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 45% of male and 16% of female carriers of the FMR1 premutation over the age of 50&nbsp;years. Currently, no effective treatment is available. We performed an open-label intervention study to assess whether allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid promoting regeneration and repair, can improve clinical symptoms, brain activity, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements in patients with FXTAS. Six patients underwent weekly intravenous infusions of allopregnanolone (2-6 mg over 30&nbsp;min) for 12&nbsp;weeks. All patients completed baseline and follow-up studies, though MRI scans were not collected from 1 patient because of MRI contraindications. The MRI scans from previous visits, along with scans from 8 age-matched male controls, were also included to establish patients' baseline condition as a reference. Functional outcomes included quantitative measurements of tremor and ataxia and neuropsychological evaluations. Brain activity consisted of event-related potential N400 word repetition effect during a semantic memory processing task. Structural MRI outcomes comprised volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities, and microstructural integrity of the corpus callosum. The results of the study showed that allopregnanolone infusions were well tolerated in all subjects. Before treatment, the patients disclosed impairment in executive function, verbal fluency and learning, and progressive deterioration of all MRI measurements. After treatment, the patients demonstrated improvement in executive functioning, episodic memory and learning, and increased N400 repetition effect amplitude. Although MRI changes were not significant as a group, both improved and deteriorated MRI measurements occurred in individual patients in contrast to uniform deterioration before the treatment. Significant correlations between baseline MRI measurements and changes in neuropsychological test scores indicated the effects of allopregnanolone on improving executive function, learning, and memory for patients with relatively preserved hippocampus and corpus callosum, while reducing psychological symptoms for patients with small hippocampi and amygdalae. The findings show the promise of allopregnanolone in improving cognitive functioning in patients with FXTAS and in partially alleviating some aspects of neurodegeneration. Further studies are needed to verify the efficacy of allopregnanolone for treating FXTAS."

The current study analyzes the effect of diet through microbiota that affect hepatic inflammation in FXR knockout (KO) mice. Wild-type and FXR KO mice were on a control (CD) or Western diet (WD) for 10 months. In addition, both CD- and WD-fed FXR KO male mice, which had hepatic lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltration, were treated by vancomycin, polymyxin B, and Abx (ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin). Mice were subjected to morphological analysis as well as gut microbiota and bile acid profiling. Male WD-fed FXR KO mice had the most severe steatohepatitis. FXR KO also had reduced Firmicutes and increased Proteobacteria, which could be reversed by Abx. In addition, Abx eliminated hepatic neutrophils and lymphocytes in CD-fed, but not WD-fed, FXR KO mice. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes persisted in WD-fed FXR KO mice even after Abx treatment. Only polymyxin B could reduce hepatic lymphocytes in WD-fed FXR KO mice. The reduced hepatic inflammation by antibiotics was accompanied by decreased free and conjugated secondary bile acids as well as changes in gut microbiota. Our data revealed that Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Coprococcus protect the liver from inflammation."

In this partially double-blinded randomized controlled trial, pregnant women â‰¤20&nbsp;weeks gestation (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;1320) were recruited from antenatal clinics and randomly assigned to receive either (1) SQ-LNS during pregnancy and for 6&nbsp;months postpartum, or (2) IFA during pregnancy only, or (3) MMN during pregnancy and for 6&nbsp;months postpartum. Maternal depressive symptoms were measured at 6&nbsp;months postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Women who scored 12 or more on the EPDS were considered to show symptoms of depression. One thousand one hundred fifty-one women were included in this analysis (LNS&nbsp;=&nbsp;382, IFA&nbsp;=&nbsp;387 and MMN&nbsp;=&nbsp;382). Characteristics of the three groups were similar at baseline, and there were no significant differences between women who were included in the analysis (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;1151) and those who were not (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;169). At 6&nbsp;months postpartum, 13% of the women overall showed symptoms of depression, and this did not differ by group (LNS&nbsp;=&nbsp;13.1%, IFA&nbsp;=&nbsp;11.2% and MMN&nbsp;=&nbsp;14.7%.

The purpose of this article is to review nutrition strategies related to muscle regeneration, glycogen restoration, fatigue, physical and immune health, and preparation for subsequent training bouts and competitions. Given the limited opportunities to recover between training bouts and games throughout the competitive season, athletes must be deliberate in their recovery strategy. Foundational components of recovery related to protein, carbohydrates, and fluid have been extensively reviewed and accepted. Micronutrients and supplements that may be efficacious for promoting recovery include vitamin D, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, creatine, collagen/vitamin C, and antioxidants. Curcumin and bromelain may also provide a recovery benefit during the competitive season but future research is warranted prior to incorporating supplemental dosages into the athlete's diet. Air travel poses nutritional challenges related to nutrient timing and quality. Incorporating strategies to consume efficacious micronutrients and ingredients is necessary to support athlete recovery in season."

Enzymatic extension of the chemically synthesized lactosyl sphingosine using efficient sequential one-pot multienzyme (OPME) reactions allowed glycosylation to be carried out in aqueous solutions. Facile C18 cartridge-based quick (<30 minutes) purification protocols were established using minimal amounts of green solvents (CH3CN and H2O). Simple acylation in the last step led to the formation of the target glycosyl ceramide in 4 steps with an overall yield of 57%.
"KASS, Philip H",A comparison of retrobulbar and two peribulbar regional anesthetic techniques in dog cadavers,"ObjectiveTo compare injectate distribution and likelihood of regional anesthesia to the orbit following retrobulbar (RB) or peribulbar (PB) injections in dog cadavers.Study designRandomized, masked study.AnimalsTwenty-four dog cadavers (aged 5.5-17 years, 2.0-36.3&nbsp;kg).MethodsOrbits underwent one of three injection techniques with bupivacaine 0.5% and iohexol (1:1): ventrolateral RB injection (1-2&nbsp;mL; 15 orbits), medial canthal PB injection (2-8&nbsp;mL; PB-1; 16 orbits), or dorsomedial and ventrolateral PB injections (each 1-4&nbsp;mL; PB-2; 16 orbits). The likelihood of successful regional anesthesia was estimated based on computed tomographic images scored for injectate volume of distribution at the base and within the extraocular muscle cone (EOMC), and injectate distribution around the optic nerve. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured before and after injections. Mixed-effects linear regression with post hoc Bonferroni contrast adjustments was performed. Significance was set at 0.05.ResultsA difference in injectate volume of distribution within or at the base of the EOMC was not detected among groups. The median optic nerve circumference of injectate distribution was significantly higher in the RB injected group than in the PB-2 group. Injectate distribution following RB, PB-1 and PB-2 injections was graded as likely to provide regional anesthesia within the EOMC in 40%, 19% and 31% of eyes, and at the EOMC base in 60%, 63% and 50% of eyes, respectively. The probability of likelihood to provide regional anesthesia was lower in dogs of higher body weights. The IOP was significantly higher than baseline following PB-1 (18&nbsp;Â±&nbsp;14&nbsp;mmHg) and in comparison with RB (2&nbsp;Â±&nbsp;3&nbsp;mmHg), but not different from PB-2 injection (10&nbsp;Â±&nbsp;11&nbsp;mmHg).Conclusions and clinical relevanceNone of the techniques reliably produced 'successful' injectate distribution based on this study's definitions; however, clinical assessment of anesthetic success is required."
"HILL, Ashley E","Pharmacokinetics of a Novel, Transdermal Fentanyl Solution in Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta).","Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are the most commonly used NHP biomedical model and experience both research and clinical procedures requiring analgesia. Opioids are a mainstay of analgesic therapy. A novel, transdermal fentanyl solution (TFS) has been developed as a long-acting, single-administration topical opioid and was reported to provide at least 4 d of effective plasma concentrations in beagles (Canis familiaris). To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of TFS in healthy adult rhesus macaques, we used a 2-period, 2-treatment crossover study of a single topical administration of 1.3 (25) and 2.6 mg/kg (50 Î¼L/kg) TFS. TFS was applied to the clipped dorsal skin of adult rhesus macaques (n = 6; 3 male, 3 female) under ketamine sedation (10 mg/kg IM). We hypothesized that TFS in rhesus macaques would provide at least 4 d of effective plasma concentrations (assumed to be â‰¥ 0.2 ng/mL, based on human studies). Plasma fentanyl concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry before drug administration and at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 240, 336, 408, and 504 h afterward. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. For each dose (1.3 and 2.6 mg/kg), respectively, the maximal plasma concentration was 1.95 Â± 0.40 and 4.19 Â± 0.69 ng/mL, occurring at 21.3 Â± 4.1 and 30.7 Â± 8.7 h; the AUC was 227.3 Â± 31.7 and 447.0 Â± 49.1 h/ng/mL, and the terminal elimination half-life was 93.7 Â± 7.1 and 98.8 Â± 5.4 h. No adverse effects were noted after drug administration at either dose. Macaques maintained plasma fentanyl concentrations of 0.2 ng/mL or greater for at least 7 d after 1.3 mg/kg and at least 10 d after 2.6 mg/kg topical administration of TFS. A single TFS dose may provide efficacious analgesia to rhesus macaques and reduce stress, discomfort, and risk to animals and personnel."
"COX, Timothy",Measurement of the jet mass in highly boosted ttÂ¯ events from pp collisions at sâˆš=8 TeV,"The first measurement of the jet mass mjet of top quark jets produced in ttÂ¯ events from pp collisions at sâˆš=8 TeV is reported for the jet with the largest transverse momentum pT in highly boosted hadronic top quark decays. The data sample, collected with the CMS detector, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7fbâˆ’1. The measurement is performed in the lepton+jets channel in which the products of the semileptonic decay tâ†’bW with Wâ†’â„“Î½ where â„“ is an electron or muon, are used to select ttÂ¯ events with large Lorentz boosts. The products of the fully hadronic decay tâ†’bW with Wâ†’qqÂ¯Â¯Â¯â€² are reconstructed using a single Cambridgeâ€“Aachen jet with distance parameter R=1.2, and pT>400 GeV. The ttÂ¯ cross section as a function of mjet is unfolded at the particle level and is used to test the modelling of highly boosted top quark production. The peak position of the mjet distribution is sensitive to the top quark mass mt, and the data are used to extract a value of mt to assess this sensitivity."
"SANTANA, Fernando",Dynamic Changes in Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Structure in Ventricular Myocytes,"The fidelity of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in ventricular myocytes is remarkable, with each action potential evoking a [CaÂ²âº](i) transient. The prevalent model is that the consistency in EC coupling in ventricular myocytes is due to the formation of fixed, tight junctions between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the sarcolemma where CaÂ²âº release is activated. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the SR is a structurally inert organelle in ventricular myocytes. Our data suggest that rather than being static, the SR undergoes frequent dynamic structural changes. SR boutons expressing functional ryanodine receptors moved throughout the cell, approaching or moving away from the sarcolemma of ventricular myocytes. These changes in SR structure occurred in the absence of changes in [CaÂ²âº](i) during EC coupling. Microtubules and the molecular motors dynein and kinesin 1(Kif5b) were important regulators of SR motility. These findings support a model in which the SR is a motile organelle capable of molecular motor protein-driven structural changes."

The recent availability of whole genome sequences has created the opportunity to develop a next generation, high-density equine SNP array.ResultsUsing whole genome sequence from 153 individuals representing 24 distinct breeds collated by the equine genomics community, we cataloged over 23 million de novo discovered genetic variants. Leveraging genotype data from individuals with both whole genome sequence, and genotypes from lower-density, legacy SNP arrays, a subset of ~5 million high-quality, high-density array candidate SNPs were selected based on breed representation and uniform spacing across the genome. Considering probe design recommendations from a commercial vendor (Affymetrix, now Thermo Fisher Scientific) a set of ~2 million SNPs were selected for a next-generation high-density SNP chip (MNEc2M). Genotype data were generated using the MNEc2M array from a cohort of 332 horses from 20 breeds and a lower-density array, consisting of ~670 thousand SNPs (MNEc670k), was designed for genotype imputation.ConclusionsHere, we document the steps taken to design both the MNEc2M and MNEc670k arrays, report genomic and technical properties of these genotyping platforms, and demonstrate the imputation capabilities of these tools for the domestic horse."

Fifty-five participants completed at least the first arm and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis; 51 participants completed both treatment arms. There were no statistically significant improvements observed on the primary outcome measure (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement), the key secondary outcome measure (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale-R), or any other secondary outcome measures in the overall study population. However, post-hoc analyses revealed positive trends in areas of anxiety, attention, and hyperactivity in participants with higher baseline anxiety and low full-scale IQ scores. No serious adverse events (AEs) occurred, although there was a significant increase in the frequency and severity of AEs related to ganaxolone compared to placebo.ConclusionsWhile ganaxolone was found to be safe, there were no significant improvements in the outcome measures in the overall study population. However, ganaxolone in subgroups of children with FXS, including those with higher anxiety or lower cognitive abilities, might have beneficial effects.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01725152."
"HEYER, Wolf D",Multi-invasions Are Recombination Byproducts that Induce Chromosomal Rearrangements,"Inaccurate repair of broken chromosomes generates structural variants that can fuel evolution and inflict pathology. We describe a novel rearrangement mechanism in which translocation between intact chromosomes is induced by a lesion on a third chromosome. This multi-invasion-induced rearrangement (MIR) stems from a homologous recombination byproduct, where a broken DNA end simultaneously invades two intact donors. No homology is required between the donors, and the intervening sequence from the invading molecule is inserted at the translocation site. MIR is stimulated by increasing homology length and spatial proximity of the donors and depends on the overlapping activities of the structure-selective endonucleases Mus81-Mms4, Slx1-Slx4, and Yen1. Conversely, the 3'-flap nuclease Rad1-Rad10 and enzymes known to disrupt recombination intermediates (Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1, Srs2, and Mph1) inhibit MIR. Resolution of MIR intermediates propagates secondary chromosome breaks that frequently cause additional rearrangements. MIR features have implications for the formation of simple and complex rearrangements underlying human pathologies."

Sustained inflation rapidly establishes functional residual capacity in fluid-filled lungs at birth. We sought to compare the hemodynamics and success in achieving return of spontaneous circulation in an asphyxial cardiac arrest lamb model with transitioning fetal circulation and fluid-filled lungs between subjects receiving continuous chest compressions during sustained inflation and those receiving conventional 3:1 compression-to-ventilation resuscitation.DesignProspective, randomized, animal model study.SettingAn experimental laboratory.SubjectsFourteen newborn term gestation lambs.InterventionsLambs were randomized into two groups: 3:1 compression-to-ventilation (control) and continuous chest compressions during sustained inflation. The umbilical cord was occluded to induce asphyxia and asystole. The control group was resuscitated per NRP guidelines. In the sustained inflation + continuous chest compressions group, sustained inflation at 35â€‰cm H2O was provided for 30 seconds with 1-second interruptions before another sustained inflation was provided. One hundred twenty chest compressions/min started after the initial sustained inflation. The first dose of IV epinephrine was given at 6 minutes if return of spontaneous circulation was not achieved and then every 3 minutes until return of spontaneous circulation or for a total of four doses.Measurement and resultsAll lambs achieved return of spontaneous circulation in a comparable median time (interquartile range) of 390 seconds (225-405â€‰s) and 345 seconds (204-465â€‰s) in the sustained inflation + continuous chest compressions and control groups, respectively. Four of seven (sustained inflation + continuous chest compressions) and three of six (control) lambs required epinephrine to achieve return of spontaneous circulation. Diastolic blood pressures were lower in the sustained inflation + continuous chest compressions (4â€‰Â±â€‰2â€‰mm Hg) compared to the control group (7â€‰Â±â€‰2â€‰mm Hg), p < 0.05. PaCO2, PaO2, and lactate were similar between the groups during the study period.ConclusionIn this perinatal cardiac arrest lamb model with transitioning fetal circulation and fluid-filled lungs, sustained inflation + continuous chest compressions is as effective as 3:1 compression-to-ventilation resuscitation in achieving return of spontaneous circulation. Half the lambs achieved return of spontaneous circulation without epinephrine. continuous chest compressions during sustained inflation reduced diastolic pressures but did not alter gas exchange or carotid blood flow compared to 3:1 compression-to-ventilation resuscitation."

Breast milk concentrations of total HMOs, sialylated HMOs, fucosylated HMOs, lactoferrin, lactalbumin, lysozymes, antitrypsin, immunoglobulin A, and osteopontin were analyzed at 6 mo postpartum (n = 647). Between-group differences in concentrations and in proportions of women classified as having low concentrations were tested.ResultsHMO and bioactive protein concentrations did not differ between groups (P > 0.10 for all comparisons). At 6 mo postpartum, the proportions of women with low HMOs or bioactive proteins were not different between groups except for osteopontin. A lower proportion of women in the IFA group had low osteopontin compared with the LNS group after adjusting for covariates (OR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.9; P = 0.016).ConclusionThe study findings do not support the hypothesis that supplementation with an LNS or MMN capsule during pregnancy and postpartum would increase HMO or bioactive milk proteins at 6 mo postpartum among Malawian women. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01239693."
"HESSL, David R","Effect of the mGluR5-NAM Basimglurant on Behavior in Adolescents and Adults with Fragile X Syndrome in a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial: FragXis Phase 2 Results","Preclinical data suggest that inhibition of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) receptor might hold therapeutic benefits in Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Treatment of Fmr1 knockout mice with mGluR5-negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) has been reported to correct a broad range of phenotypes related to FXS. The early short-term clinical trials with mGluR5 NAMs, including basimglurant, assessing the effects in individuals with FXS, were supportive of further exploration in larger, well-controlled trials. We evaluated basimglurant, a potent and selective mGluR5 NAM, in a 12-week, double-blind, parallel-group study of 183 adults and adolescents (aged 14-50, mean 23.4 years) with FXS. Individuals with an FMR1 full mutation were randomized to placebo or one of two doses of basimglurant. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in behavioral symptoms using the Anxiety Depression and Mood Scale (ADAMS) total score. All treatment arms showed marked behavioral improvements from baseline to week 12 with less improvement in the basimglurant 1.5â€‰mg arm than placebo; however, basimglurant 0.5â€‰mg was inferior to placebo in the ADAMs total score. Treatment with basimglurant was overall well-tolerated. A higher incidence of adverse events classified as psychiatric disorders were reported in patients treated with basimglurant, including three patients with hallucinations or psychosis. In this phase 2 clinical trial, basimglurant did not demonstrate improvement over placebo. Evaluation of the overall risk-benefit in younger patient populations is an important consideration for the design of potential further investigations of efficacy with this class of medications."

"STACHOWICZ, John J",Microbiome succession during ammonification in eelgrass bed sediments.,"BackgroundEelgrass (Zostera marina) is a marine angiosperm and foundation species that plays an important ecological role in primary production, food web support, and elemental cycling in coastal ecosystems. As with other plants, the microbial communities living in, on, and near eelgrass are thought to be intimately connected to the ecology and biology of eelgrass. Here we characterized the microbial communities in eelgrass sediments throughout an experiment to quantify the rate of ammonification, the first step in early remineralization of organic matter, also known as diagenesis, from plots at a field site in Bodega Bay, CA.MethodsSediment was collected from 72 plots from a 15 month long field experiment in which eelgrass genotypic richness and relatedness were manipulated. In the laboratory, we placed sediment samples (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 per plot) under a N2 atmosphere, incubated them at in situ temperatures (15&nbsp;Â°C) and sampled them initially and after 4, 7, 13, and 19 days to determine the ammonification rate. Comparative microbiome analysis using high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was performed on sediment samples taken initially and at seven, 13 and 19 days to characterize changes in the relative abundances of microbial taxa throughout ammonification.ResultsWithin-sample diversity of the sediment microbial communities across all plots decreased after the initial timepoint using both richness based (observed number of OTUs, Chao1) and richness and evenness based diversity metrics (Shannon, Inverse Simpson). Additionally, microbial community composition changed across the different timepoints. Many of the observed changes in relative abundance of taxonomic groups between timepoints appeared driven by sulfur cycling with observed decreases in predicted sulfur reducers (Desulfobacterales) and corresponding increases in predicted sulfide oxidizers (Thiotrichales). None of these changes in composition or richness were associated with variation in ammonification rates.DiscussionOur results showed that the microbiome of sediment from different plots followed similar successional patterns, which we infer to be due to changes related to sulfur metabolism. These large changes likely overwhelmed any potential changes in sediment microbiome related to ammonification rate. We found no relationship between eelgrass presence or genetic composition and the microbiome. This was likely due to our sampling of bulk sediments to measure ammonification rates rather than sampling microbes in sediment directly in contact with the plants and suggests that eelgrass influence on the sediment microbiome may be limited in spatial extent. More in-depth functional studies associated with eelgrass microbiome will be required in order to fully understand the implications of these microbial communities in broader host-plant and ecosystem functions (e.g., elemental cycling and eelgrass-microbe interactions)."

"IZUMIYA, Yoshihiro",ZIC2 Is Essential for Maintenance of Latency and Is a Target of an Immediate Early Protein during Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Lytic Reactivation,"Bivalent histone modifications are defined as repressive and activating epigenetic marks that simultaneously decorate the same genomic region. The H3K27me3 mark silences gene expression, while the H3K4me3 mark prevents the region from becoming permanently silenced and prepares the domain for activation when needed. Specific regions of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latent episomes are poised to be activated by the KSHV replication and transcription activator (K-Rta). How KSHV episomes are prepared such that they maintain latent infection and switch to lytic replication by K-Rta remains unclear. K-Rta transactivation activity requires a protein degradation function; thus, we hypothesized that identification of cellular substrates of K-Rta may provide insight into the maintenance of KSHV latent infection and the switch to lytic replication. Here we show that a zinc finger protein, ZIC2, a key regulator for central nervous system development, is a substrate of K-Rta and is responsible for maintaining latency. K-Rta directly interacted with ZIC2 and functioned as an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate ZIC2. ZIC2 localized at immediate early and early gene cluster regions of the KSHV genome and contributed to tethering of polycomb repressive complex 2 through physical interaction, thus maintaining H3K27me3 marks at the K-Rta promoter. Accordingly, depletion of ZIC2 shifted the balance of bivalent histone modifications toward more active forms and induced KSHV reactivation in naturally infected cells. We suggest that ZIC2 turnover by K-Rta is a strategy employed by KSHV to favor the transition from latency to lytic replication.IMPORTANCE Posttranslational histone modifications regulate the accessibility of transcriptional factors to DNA; thus, they have profound effects on gene expression (e.g., viral reactivation). KSHV episomes are known to possess bivalent chromatin domains. How such KSHV chromatin domains are maintained to be reactivatable by K-Rta remains unclear. We found that ZIC2, a transcriptional factor essential for stem cell pluripotency, plays a role in maintaining KSHV latent infection in naturally infected cells. We found that ZIC2 degradation by K-Rta shifts bivalent histone marks to a more active configuration, leading to KSHV reactivation. ZIC2 interacts with and maintains polycomb repressor complex 2 at the K-Rta promoter. Our findings uncover (i) a mechanism utilized by KSHV to maintain latent infection, (ii) a latency-lytic cycle switch operated by K-Rta, and (iii) a molecular mechanism of ZIC2-mediated local histone modification."

The reaction occurs in two stages: Mn(II) â†’ Mn(III) and Mn(III) â†’ MnO2. In a companion study , we show that the electron transfer from Mn(II) to the low-potential type 1 Cu of MnxG requires an activation step, likely forming a hydroxide bridge at a dinuclear Mn(II) site. Here we study the second oxidation step, using pyrophosphate (PP) as a Mn(III) trap. PP chelates Mn(III) produced by the enzyme and subsequently allows it to become a substrate for the second stage of the reaction. EPR spectroscopy confirms the presence of Mn(III) bound to the enzyme. The Mn(III) oxidation step does not involve direct electron transfer to the enzyme from Mn(III), which is shown by kinetic measurements to be excluded from the Mn(II) binding site. Instead, Mn(III) is proposed to disproportionate at an adjacent polynuclear site, thereby allowing indirect oxidation to Mn(IV) and recycling of Mn(II). PP plays a multifaceted role, slowing the reaction by complexing both Mn(II) and Mn(III) in solution, and also inhibiting catalysis, likely through binding at or near the active site. An overall mechanism for Mnx-catalyzed MnO2 production from Mn(II) is presented."
"CHEN, Ling-Xin",A Clinical Prediction Score to Guide Referral of Elderly Dialysis Patients for Kidney Transplant Evaluation,"IntroductionDialysis patients aged â‰¥70 years derive improved life expectancy through kidney transplantation compared to their waitlisted counterparts, but guidelines are not clear about how to identify appropriate transplantation candidates. We developed a clinical prediction score to identify elderly dialysis patients with expected 5-year survival appropriate for kidney transplantation (>5 years).MethodsIncident dialysis patients in 2006-2009 aged â‰¥70 were identified from the United States Renal Data System database and divided into derivation and validation cohorts. Using the derivation cohort, candidate variables with a significant crude association with 5-year all-cause mortality were included in a multivariable logistic regression model to generate a scoring system. The scoring system was tested in the validation cohort and a cohort of elderly transplant recipients.ResultsCharacteristics most predictive of 5-year mortality included age >80, body mass index (BMI) <18, the presence of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), immobility, and being institutionalized. Factors associated with increased 5-year survival were non-white race, a primary cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) other than diabetes, employment within 6 months of dialysis initiation, and dialysis start via arteriovenous fistula (AVF). 5-year mortality was 47% for the lowest risk score group (3.6% of the validation cohort) and >90% for the highest risk cohort (42% of the validation cohort).ConclusionThis clinical prediction score could be useful for physicians to identify potentially suitable candidates for kidney transplantation."

We describe the outcomes of 253 patients with relapsed WT who received high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) between 1990 and 2013, and were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research. The 5-year estimates for event-free survival (EFS) and OS were 36% (95% confidence interval (CI); 29-43%) and 45% (95 CI; 38-51%), respectively. Relapse of primary disease was the cause of death in 81% of the population. EFS, OS, relapse and transplant-related mortality showed no significant differences when broken down by disease status at transplant, time from diagnosis to transplant, year of transplant or conditioning regimen. Our data suggest that HDT followed by autologous HCT for relapsed WT is well tolerated and outcomes are similar to those reported in the literature. As attempts to conduct a randomized trial comparing maintenance chemotherapy with consolidation versus HDT followed by stem cell transplant have failed, one should balance the potential benefits with the yet unknown long-term risks. As disease recurrence continues to be the most common cause of death, future research should focus on the development of consolidation therapies for those patients achieving complete response to therapy."
"DAHLKE, Helen",Modeling the release of Escherichia coli from soil into overland flow under raindrop impact,"Pathogen transport through the environment is complicated, involving a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes. This study considered the transfer of microorganisms from soil into overland flow under rain-splash conditions. Although microorganisms are colloidal particles, they are commonly quantified as colony-forming units (CFUs) per volume rather than as a mass or number of particles per volume, which poses a modeling challenge. However, for very small particles that essentially remain suspended after being ejected into ponded water and for which diffusion can be neglected, the Gao model, originally derived for solute transfer from soil, describes particle transfer into suspension and is identical to the Hairsineâ€“Rose particle erosion model for this special application. Small-scale rainfall experiments were conducted in which an Escherichia coli (E. coli) suspension was mixed with a simple soil (9:1 sand-to-clay mass ratio). The model fit the experimental E. coli data. Although re-conceptualizing the Gao solute model as a particle suspension model was convenient for accommodating the unfortunate units of CFU mlâˆ’1, the Hairsineâ€“Rose model is insensitive to assumptions about E. coli per CFU as long as the assumed initial mass concentration of E. coli is very small compared to that of the soil particle classes. Although they undoubtedly actively interact with their environment, this study shows that transport of microorganisms from soil into overland storm flows can be reasonably modeled using the same principles that have been applied to small mineral particles in previous studies."

This observational study utilized the California Cancer Registry to estimate the risk of developing ALL after a prior malignancy using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs, 95% confidence intervals). ALL occurring after a malignancy with an SIR>1 (increased-risk (IR) malignancies) was considered secondary ALL (s-ALL). Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs, 95% confidence intervals) compared the effect of s-ALL with de novo ALL on overall survival. A total of 14â€‰481 patients with ALL were identified (1988-2012) and 382 (3%) had a known prior malignancy. Any prior malignancy predisposed patients to developing ALL: SIR 1.62 (1.45-1.79). Hematologic malignancies (SIR 5.57, 4.38-6.98) and IR-solid tumors (SIR 2.11, 1.73-2.54) increased the risk of developing ALL. s-ALL increased the risk of death compared with de novo ALL (aHR 1.38 (1.16-1.63)) and this effect was more pronounced among younger patients (age<40 years: aHR 4.80 (3.15-7.30); ageâ©¾40 years: aHR 1.40 (1.16-1.69)) (interaction P<0.001).

"CORTOPASSI, Gino",In Vitro Evaluation of Mitochondrial Function and Estrogen Signaling in Cell Lines Exposed to the Antiseptic Cetylpyridinium Chloride,"BackgroundQuaternary ammonium salts (QUATS), such as cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and benzalkonium chloride (BAK), are frequently used in antiseptic formulations, including toothpastes, mouthwashes, lozenges, throat and nasal sprays, and as biocides. Although in a recent ruling, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned CPC from certain products and requested more data on BAK's efficacy and safety profile, QUATS, in general, and CPC and BAK, in particular, continue to be used in personal health care, food, and pharmaceutical and cleaning industries.ObjectivesWe aimed to assess CPC's effects on mitochondrial toxicity and endocrine disruption in vitro.MethodMitochondrial O2 consumption and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis rates of osteosarcoma cybrid cells were measured before and after CPC and BAK treatment. Antiestrogenic effects of the compounds were measured by a luciferase-based assay using recombinant human breast carcinoma cells (VM7Luc4E2, ERalpha-positive).ResultsCPC inhibited both mitochondrial O2 consumption [halfâ€‰maximalâ€‰inhibitoryâ€‰concentrationâ€‰(IC50): 3.8Î¼M] and ATP synthesis (IC50: 0.9Î¼M), and additional findings supported inhibition of mitochondrial complex 1 as the underlying mechanism for these effects. In addition, CPC showed concentration-dependent antiestrogenic activity half maximal effective concentration [(EC50): 4.5Î¼M)]. BAK, another antimicrobial QUATS that is structurally similar to CPC, and the pesticide rotenone, a known complex 1 inhibitor, also showed mitochondrial inhibitory and antiestrogenic effects. In all three cases, there was overlap of the antiestrogenic activity with the mitochondrial inhibitory activity.ConclusionsMitochondrial inhibition in vitro occurred at a CPC concentration that may be relevant to human exposures. The antiestrogenic activity of CPC, BAK, rotenone, and triclosan may be related to their mitochondrial inhibitory activity. Our findings support the need for additional research on the mitochondrial inhibitory and antiestrogenic effects of QUATS, including CPC and BAK. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1404."

"WETZEL, Andrew R",The Importance of Preventive Feedback: Inference from Observations of the Stellar Masses and Metallicities of Milky Way Dwarf Galaxies,"Dwarf galaxies are known to have remarkably low star formation efficiency due to strong feedback. Adopting the dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way (MW) as a laboratory, we explore a flexible semi-analytic galaxy formation model to understand how the feedback processes shape the satellite galaxies of the MW. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we exhaustively search a large parameter space of the model and rigorously show that the general wisdom of strong outflows as the primary feedback mechanism cannot simultaneously explain the stellar mass function and the mass-metallicity relation of the MW satellites. An extended model that assumes that a fraction of baryons is prevented from collapsing into low-mass halos in the first place can be accurately constrained to simultaneously reproduce those observations. The inference suggests that two different physical mechanisms are needed to explain the two different data sets. In particular, moderate outflows with weak halo mass dependence are needed to explain the mass-metallicity relation, and prevention of baryons falling into shallow gravitational potentials of low-mass halos (e.g., ""pre-heating"") is needed to explain the low stellar mass fraction for a given subhalo mass."

"RUNCIE, Daniel E",The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (Picea glauca),"Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 Â°C/16 Â°C and cool = 8 Â°C/4 Â°C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth-dormancy transition-including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange-within two provenances of white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests."

Secondary outcomes included postpartum visit completion, overall contraception initiation at the postpartum visit, overall contraceptive use at 6 months after delivery, and repeat pregnancies by 6 months postpartum. We obtained delivery and postpartum information using the electronic medical record and contacted participants 3 and 6 months after delivery to assess contraception use and repeat pregnancies.ResultsWe enrolled 586 participants between December 2014 and November 2015, of whom 512 women (256 in each cohort) continued to meet eligibility criteria after delivery. Long-acting reversible contraception initiation rates at the postpartum visit were lower in the 2- to 3-week (16.5%, 95% CI 12.2-21.8) compared with the 6-week group (31.1%, 95% CI 25.2-37.7, P<.01), primarily as a result of patient and health care provider preferences for delaying intrauterine device insertion to a later visit. More women completed a scheduled 2- to 3-week postpartum visit (90.2%, 95% CI 86.0-93.3) compared with a 6-week visit (81.6%, 95% CI 76.4-85.9, P<.01). Deferral of any contraception initiation was higher in the 2- to 3-week group (27.3%, 95% CI 21.9-33.4) compared with the 6-week group (15.8%, 95% CI 11.5-21.4, P<.01), but there were no differences in overall contraceptive use patterns at 6 months postpartum. No intrauterine device perforations or expulsions were observed in women who underwent insertion at 2-3 weeks postpartum. Five pregnancies were reported in each cohort by 6 months after delivery.ConclusionScheduling a visit at 2-3 weeks after delivery was not associated with increased long-acting reversible contraception initiation at this visit despite higher postpartum visit attendance."

In this work, we employ extensive molecular dynamics simulations to study thermal transport in large suspended polycrystalline graphene samples. Samples of different controlled grain sizes are prepared by a recently developed efficient multiscale approach based on the phase field crystal model. In contrast to previous works, our results show that the scaling of the thermal conductivity with the grain size implies bimodal behavior with two effective Kapitza lengths. The scaling is dominated by the out-of-plane (flexural) phonons with a Kapitza length that is an order of magnitude larger than that of the in-plane phonons. We also show that, to get quantitative agreement with the most recent experiments, quantum corrections need to be applied to both the Kapitza conductance of grain boundaries and the thermal conductivity of pristine graphene, and the corresponding Kapitza lengths must be renormalized accordingly."

"PARIKH, Sanjai J",Biochemical proxies indicate differences in soil C cycling induced by long-term tillage and residue management in a tropical agroecosystem,"Background &amp; aim: A potential benefit of conservation agriculture (CA) is soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual, yet recent studies indicate limited or no impact of CA on total SOC in tropical agroecosystems. We evaluated biochemical indicators of soil C cycling after 9&nbsp;years (18 seasons) of contrasting tillage with and without maize residue retention in western Kenya. Methods: Potential activities of C-cycling enzymes (Î²-glucosidase, GLU; Î²-galactosidase, GAL; glucosaminidase, GLM; cellobiohydrolase, CEL), permanganate-oxidizable C (POXC), and soil organic matter (SOM) composition (by infrared spectroscopy) were measured. Results: POXC tended to be greater under reduced tillage and residue retention, but did not significantly differ among treatments (â‰¤ 2% of SOC). Despite no significant differences in SOC concentrations or stocks, activities of all 4 C-cycling enzymes responded strongly to tillage, and to a lesser extent to residue management. Activities of GLU, GAL, and GLM were greatest under the combination of reduced tillage and residue retention relative to other treatments. Reduced tillage produced an enrichment in carboxyl C&nbsp;=&nbsp;O (+6%) and decreased polysaccharide C-O (âˆ’3.5%) relative to conventional tillage irrespective of residue management. Conclusions: Though enzyme activities and POXC are typically associated with SOC accrual, changes in soil C cycling at this site have not translated into significant differences in SOC after 9&nbsp;years. Elevated enzyme activities may have offset potential SOC accumulation under CA. However, the ratio of C-cycling enzyme activities to SOC was higher under reduced tillage and residue retention relative to other treatments, indicating that stoichiometric scaling of SOC and enzyme activities does not explain absence of significant differences in SOC among tillage and residue managements. Potential factors that may explain the low SOC accrual rates in this tropical agroecosystem included the low, albeit realistic, levels of residue retention, nutrient limitations, and high temperatures favoring decomposition."

METHODS:Adult male patients diagnosed with SCST between 1988 and 2010 were identified within the California Cancer Registry (CCR). Baseline demographic variables and disease characteristics were reported. Primary outcome measures were cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Bivariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were employed to identify predictors of survival. RESULTS:A total of 67 patients with SCST were identified, of which 45 (67%) had Leydig cell and 19 (28%) had Sertoli cell tumours. Median age was 40 years and the majority of patients (84%) presented with localized disease. Following orchiectomy, nine patients (15%) underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), whereas 54 patients (80%) had no further treatment. With a median followup of 75 months, two-year OS and CSS was 91% and 95%, respectively, for those presenting with stage I disease. For those presenting with stage II disease, two-year OS and CSS was 30%. Predictors of worse OS included age >60 (hazard ratio [HR] 5.64; p<0.01) and metastatic disease (HR 8.56; p<0.01). Presentation with metastatic disease was the only variable associated with worse CSS (HR 13.36; p<0.01). Histology was not found to be a significant predictor of either CSS or OS. CONCLUSIONS:We present the largest reported series to date for this rare tumour and provide contemporary epidemiological and treatment data. The primary driver of prognosis in patients with SCST is disease stage, emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention."
"EVINER, Valerie",Review of research to inform California's climate scoping plan: Agriculture and working lands,"Agriculture in California contributes 8% of the state's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To inform the state's policy and program strategy to meet climate targets, we review recent research on practices that can reduce emissions, sequester carbon and provide other co-benefits to producers and the environment across agriculture and rangeland systems. Importantly, the research reviewed here was conducted in California and addresses practices in our specific agricultural, socioeconomic and biophysical environment. Farmland conversion and the dairy and intensive livestock sector are the largest contributors to GHG emissions and offer the greatest opportunities for avoided emissions. We also identify a range of other opportunities including soil and nutrient management, integrated and diversified farming systems, rangeland management, and biomass-based energy generation.

Rich in unsaturated fats, especially linoleic acid, soybean oil is assumed to be healthy, and yet it induces obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and fatty liver in mice. Here, we show that the genetically modified soybean oil Plenish, which came on the U.S. market in 2014 and is low in linoleic acid, induces less obesity than conventional soybean oil in C57BL/6 male mice. Proteomic analysis of the liver reveals global differences in hepatic proteins when comparing diets rich in the two soybean oils, coconut oil, and a low-fat diet. Metabolomic analysis of the liver and plasma shows a positive correlation between obesity and hepatic C18 oxylipin metabolites of omega-6 (Ï‰6) and omega-3 (Ï‰3) fatty acids (linoleic and Î±-linolenic acid, respectively) in the cytochrome P450/soluble epoxide hydrolase pathway. While Plenish induced less insulin resistance than conventional soybean oil, it resulted in hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction as did olive oil, which has a similar fatty acid composition. These results implicate a new class of compounds in diet-induced obesity-C18 epoxide and diol oxylipins."

"ZHANG, Hongyong",â€œOne-Potâ€ Fabrication of Highly Versatile and Biocompatible Poly(vinyl alcohol)-porphyrin-based Nanotheranostics,"Nanoparticle-based theranostic agents have emerged as a new paradigm in nanomedicine field for integration of multimodal imaging and therapeutic functions within a single platform. However, the clinical translation of these agents is severely limited by the complexity of fabrication, long-term toxicity of the materials, and unfavorable biodistributions. Here we report an extremely simple and robust approach to develop highly versatile and biocompatible theranostic poly(vinyl alcohol)-porphyrin nanoparticles (PPNs). Through a ""one-pot"" fabrication process, including the chelation of metal ions and encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs, monodispersenanoparticle could be formed by self-assembly of a very simple and biocompatible building block (poly(vinyl alcohol)-porphyrin conjugate). Using this approach, we could conveniently produce multifunctional PPNs that integrate optical imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT) and drug delivery functions in one formulation. PPNs exhibited unique architecture-dependent fluorescence self-quenching, as well as photodynamic- and photothermal- properties. Near-infrared fluorescence could be amplified upon PPN dissociation, providing feasibility of low-background fluorescence imaging. Doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded PPNs achieved 53 times longer half-life in blood circulation than free DOX. Upon irradiation by near infrared light at a single excitation wavelength, PPNs could be activated to release reactive oxygen species, heat and drugs simultaneously at the tumor sites in mice bearing tumor xenograft, resulting in complete eradication of tumors. Due to their organic compositions, PPNs showed no obvious cytotoxicity in mice via intravenous administration during therapeutic studies. This highly versatile and multifunctional PPN theranostic nanoplatform showed great potential for the integration of multimodal imaging and therapeutic functions towards personalized nanomedicine against cancers."

Here, for the first time, we show that Zdhhc13 plays a key role in anxiety-related behaviors and motor function, as well as brain bioenergetics, in a mouse model (luc) carrying a spontaneous Zdhhc13 recessive mutation. At 3â€‰m of age, mutant mice displayed increased sensorimotor gating, anxiety, hypoactivity, and decreased motor coordination, compared to littermate controls. Loss of Zdhhc13 in cortex and cerebellum from 3- and 24â€‰m old hetero- and homozygous male mutant mice resulted in lower levels of Drp1 S-palmitoylation accompanied by altered mitochondrial dynamics, increased glycolysis, glutaminolysis and lactic acidosis, and neurotransmitter imbalances. Employing in vivo and in vitro models, we identified that Zdhhc13-dependent Drp1 S-palmitoylation, which acting alone or in concert, enables the normal occurrence of the fission-fusion process. In vitro and in vivo direct Zdhhc13-Drp1 protein interaction was observed, confirming Drp1 as a substrate of Zdhhc13. Abnormal fission-fusion processes result in disrupted mitochondria morphology and distribution affecting not only mitochondrial ATP output but neurotransmission and integrity of synaptic structures in the brain, setting the basis for the behavioral abnormalities described in the Zdhhc13-deficient mice."

"NIEVES-CINTRON, Madeline",Regulation of voltageâ€gated potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle during hypertension and metabolic disorders,"Voltage-gated potassium (KV ) channels are key regulators of vascular smooth muscle contractility and vascular tone, and thus have major influence on the microcirculation. KV channels are important determinants of vascular smooth muscle membrane potential (Em ). A number of KV subunits are expressed in the plasma membrane of smooth muscle cells. Each subunit confers distinct kinetics and regulatory properties that allow for fine control of Em to orchestrate vascular tone. Modifications in KV subunit expression and/or channel activity can contribute to changes in vascular smooth muscle contractility in response to different stimuli and in diverse pathological conditions. Consistent with this, a number of studies suggest alterations in KV subunit expression and/or function as underlying contributing mechanisms for small resistance artery dysfunction in pathologies such as hypertension and metabolic disorders, including diabetes. Here, we review our current knowledge on the effects of these pathologies on KV channel expression and function in vascular smooth muscle cells, and the repercussions on (micro)vascular function."
"MEIER, Alan K",Folk Labeling: Insights on Improving Usability and Saving Energy Gleaned from After-Market Graffiti on Common Appliances.,"The after-market labeling of a device by its users often indicates problematic usability,
which can affect the device's energy consumption. For example, when people find a lighting
control panel difficult to use, they often write instructions on a piece of paper and affix it nearby
as a reminder to themselves and to help others.
We collected over a hundred examples of these â€œfolk labelsâ€ from commercial and
residential buildings through an online contest inviting people to upload photos of folk label
examples, informal solicitation of colleagues, online searches, and personal observation. Some
folk labels offered guidance or reminders (e.g., turn off light before fan on a projector); some
provided specific instructions for multi-function controls or addressed problems identifying
orientation or direction (right/left, on/off). We categorized these folk labels (e.g., by location,
subject, form, etc.), and analyzed them according to usability guidelines and heuristics1
. In
addition, we evaluated their potential impact on energy consumption. We found that most folk
labels indicated usability issues in three areas: visibility of available options, natural mappings,
and consistency. For example, one light switch looked like a simple toggle ON-OFF control, but
actually could control various dimming options (violated â€œvisibility of available optionsâ€
principle). One would naturally turn the light on full power if one did not know how to use the
dimming capability. We discovered that folk labeling provides a simple means of identifying
usability problems."

Its postsynaptic displacement is necessary for loss of AMPARs during homeostatic scaling down of synapses. Here, we demonstrate that upon Ca2+ influx, Ca2+/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) binding to the N-terminus of PSD-95 mediates postsynaptic loss of PSD-95 and AMPARs during homeostatic scaling down. Our NMR structural analysis identified E17 within the PSD-95 N-terminus as important for binding to Ca2+/CaM by interacting with R126 on CaM. Mutating E17 to R prevented homeostatic scaling down in primary hippocampal neurons, which is rescued via charge inversion by ectopic expression of CaMR126E, as determined by analysis of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Accordingly, increased binding of Ca2+/CaM to PSD-95 induced by a chronic increase in Ca2+ influx is a critical molecular event in homeostatic downscaling of glutamatergic synaptic transmission."
"CHEN, Ching-Hsien",Cigarette Smoke Regulates the Competitive Interactions between NRF2 and BACH1 for Heme Oxygenase-1 Induction,"Cigarette smoke has been shown to trigger aberrant signaling pathways and pathophysiological processes; however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying smoke-induced gene expression remain to be established. Herein, we observed that two smoke-responsive genes, HO-1 and CYP1A1, are robustly induced upon smoke by different mechanisms in human bronchial epithelia. CYP1A1 is mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, while induction of HO-1 is regulated by oxidative stress, and suppressed by N-acetylcysteine treatment. In light of a pivotal role of NRF2 and BACH1 in response to oxidative stress and regulation of HO-1, we examined if smoke-induced HO-1 expression is modulated through the NRF2/BACH1 axis. We demonstrated that smoke causes significant nuclear translocation of NRF2, but only a slight decrease in nuclear BACH1. Knockdown of NRF2 attenuated smoke-induced HO-1 expression while down-regulation of BACH1 had stimulatory effects on both basal and smoke-induced HO-1 with trivial influence on NRF2 nuclear translocation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that smoke augments promoter-specific DNA binding of NRF2 but suppresses BACH1 binding to the HO-1 promoter ARE sites, two of which at -1.0 kb and -2.6 kb are newly identified. These results suggest that the regulation of NRF2 activator and BACH1 repressor binding to the ARE sites are critical for smoke-mediated HO-1 induction."

We determined the effect of midlife hypertension (â‰¥140/90 mm Hg), late life hypertension, lower late life blood pressure (<100/70 mm Hg), persistence of hypertension during mid- to late life, and steep decline in blood pressure from mid- to late life over an 18-year exposure period.ResultsDuring the follow-up period, 107 participants (71 women) developed dementia. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, we found that midlife systolic hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.35) and persistence of systolic hypertension into late life (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.25-3.09) were associated with an elevated risk of incident dementia. However, in individuals with low to normal blood pressure (â‰¤140/90 mm Hg) at midlife, a steep decline in systolic blood pressure during mid- to late life was also associated with a >2-fold increase in dementia risk (HR 2.40, 95% CI 1.39-4.15).ConclusionsElevated blood pressure during midlife, persistence of elevated blood pressure into late life, and, among nonhypertensives, a steep decline in blood pressure during mid- to late life were associated with an increased dementia risk in a community-based cohort. Our data highlight the potential sustained cognitive benefits of lower blood pressures in midlife but also suggest that declining blood pressure in older adults with prehypertension or normotension, but not in those with hypertension, may be a risk marker for dementia."
"STEWART, Christine P",Eggs early in complementary feeding increase choline pathway biomarkers and DHA: a randomized controlled trial in Ecuador,"Background: Choline status has been associated with stunting among young children. Findings from this study showed that an egg intervention improved linear growth by a length-for-age z score of 0.63.Objective: We aimed to test the efficacy of eggs introduced early in complementary feeding on plasma concentrations of biomarkers in choline pathways, vitamins B-12 and A, and essential fatty acids.Design: A randomized controlled trial, the Lulun (""egg"" in Kichwa) Project, was conducted in a rural indigenous population of Ecuador. Infants aged 6-9 mo were randomly assigned to treatment (1 egg/d for 6 mo; n = 80) and control (no intervention; n = 83) groups. Socioeconomic data, anthropometric measures, and blood samples were collected at baseline and endline. Household visits were made weekly for morbidity surveillance. We tested vitamin B-12 plasma concentrations by using chemiluminescent competitive immunoassay and plasma concentrations of choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, retinol, essential fatty acids, methionine, dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) with the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.Results: Socioeconomic factors and biomarker concentrations were comparable at baseline. Of infants, 11.4% were vitamin B-12 deficient and 31.7% marginally deficient at baseline. In adjusted generalized linear regression modeling, the egg intervention increased plasma concentrations compared with control by the following effect sizes: choline, 0.35 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.57); betaine, 0.29 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.58); methionine, 0.31 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.60); docosahexaenoic acid, 0.43 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.73); DMA, 0.37 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.69); and TMAO, 0.33 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.58). No significant group differences were found for vitamin B-12, retinol, linoleic acid (LA), Î±-linolenic acid (ALA), or ratios of betaine to choline and LA to ALA.Conclusion: The findings supported our hypothesis that early introduction of eggs significantly improved choline and other markers in its methyl group metabolism pathway. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02446873."

Our previous analyses have identified potential kinase targets critical for the growth of ER-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative and HER2-negative, or ""triple-negative"" breast cancer (TNBC). Because phosphatases regulate the function of kinase signaling pathways, in this study, we investigated whether phosphatases are also differentially expressed in ER-negative compared to those in ER-positive breast cancers. We compared RNA expression in 98 human breast cancers (56 ER-positive and 42 ER-negative) to identify phosphatases differentially expressed in ER-negative compared to those in ER-positive breast cancers. We then examined the effects of one selected phosphatase, dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), on proliferation, cell growth, migration and invasion, and on signaling pathways using protein microarray analyses of 172 proteins, including phosphoproteins. We identified 48 phosphatase genes are significantly differentially expressed in ER-negative compared to those in ER-positive breast tumors. We discovered that 31 phosphatases were more highly expressed, while 11 were underexpressed specifically in ER-negative breast cancers. The DUSP4 gene is underexpressed in ER-negative breast cancer and is deleted in approximately 50&nbsp;% of breast cancers. Induced DUSP4 expression suppresses both in vitro and in vivo growths of breast cancer cells. Our studies show that induced DUSP4 expression blocks the cell cycle at the G1/S checkpoint; inhibits ERK1/2, p38, JNK1, RB, and NFkB p65 phosphorylation; and inhibits invasiveness of TNBC cells. These results suggest that that DUSP4 is a critical regulator of the growth and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells."
"BROWN, Patrick H",TLR4 has a TP53-dependent dual role in regulating breast cancer cell growth,"Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death, and it is important to understand pathways that drive the disease to devise effective therapeutic strategies. Our results show that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) drives breast cancer cell growth differentially based on the presence of TP53, a tumor suppressor. TP53 is mutationally inactivated in most types of cancer and is mutated in 30-50% of diagnosed breast tumors. We demonstrate that TLR4 activation inhibits growth of TP53 wild-type cells, but promotes growth of TP53 mutant breast cancer cells by regulating proliferation. This differential effect is mediated by changes in tumor cell cytokine secretion. Whereas TLR4 activation in TP53 mutant breast cancer cells increases secretion of progrowth cytokines, TLR4 activation in TP53 wild-type breast cancer cells increases type I IFN (IFN-Î³) secretion, which is both necessary and sufficient for mediating TLR4-induced growth inhibition. This study identifies a novel dichotomous role for TLR4 as a growth regulator and a modulator of tumor microenvironment in breast tumors. These results have translational relevance, demonstrating that TP53 mutant breast tumor growth can be suppressed by pharmacologic TLR4 inhibition, whereas TLR4 inhibitors may in fact promote growth of TP53 wild-type tumors. Furthermore, using data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium, we demonstrate that the effect of TP53 mutational status on TLR4 activity may extend to ovarian, colon, and lung cancers, among others, suggesting that the viability of TLR4 as a therapeutic target depends on TP53 status in many different tumor types."

We identified a rare FMR1 gene mutation (c.413G>A), previously reported in a single patient and reviewed the literature for other rare FMR1 mutations. Our patient at 10 years of age presented with the classical findings of FXS including intellectual disability, autism, craniofacial findings, hyperextensibility, fleshy hands, flat feet, unsteady gait, and seizures but without the typical CGG-repeat expansion. He had more features of FXS than the previously reported patient with the same mutation. Twenty individuals reported previously with rare missense or nonsense mutations or other coding disturbances of the FMR1 gene ranged in age from infancy to 50 years; most were verbal with limited speech, had autism and hyperactivity, and all had intellectual disability. Four of the 20 individuals had a mutation within exon 15, three within exon 5, and two within exon 2. The FMR1 missense mutation (c.413G>A) is the same as in a previously reported male where it was shown that there was preservation of the post-synaptic function of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the encoded protein of the FMR1 gene was preserved. Both patients with this missense mutation had physical, cognitive, and behavioral features similarly seen in FXS."
"HELL, Johannes W",Molecular mimicking of C-terminal phosphorylation tunes the surface dynamics of CaV1.2 calcium channels in hippocampal neurons,"L-type voltage-gated CaV1.2 calcium channels (CaV1.2) are key regulators of neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and excitation-transcription coupling. Surface-exposed CaV1.2 distributes in clusters along the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. A permanent exchange between stably clustered and laterally diffusive extra-clustered channels maintains steady-state levels of CaV1.2 at dendritic signaling domains. A dynamic equilibrium between anchored and diffusive receptors is a common feature among ion channels and is crucial to modulate signaling transduction. Despite the importance of this fine regulatory system, the molecular mechanisms underlying the surface dynamics of CaV1.2 are completely unexplored. Here, we examined the dynamic states of CaV1.2 depending on phosphorylation on Ser-1700 and Ser-1928 at the channel C terminus. Phosphorylation at these sites is strongly involved in CaV1.2-mediated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling, long-term potentiation, and responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation. We engineered CaV1.2 constructs mimicking phosphorylation at Ser-1700 and Ser-1928 and analyzed their behavior at the membrane by immunolabeling protocols, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and single particle tracking. We found that the phosphomimetic S1928E variant increases the mobility of CaV1.2 without altering the steady-state maintenance of cluster in young neurons and favors channel stabilization later in differentiation. Instead, mimicking phosphorylation at Ser-1700 promoted the diffusive state of CaV1.2 irrespective of the differentiation stage. Together, these results reveal that phosphorylation could contribute to the establishment of channel anchoring mechanisms depending on the neuronal differentiation state. Finally, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which phosphorylation at the C terminus regulates calcium signaling by tuning the content of CaV1.2 at signaling complexes."

"SMITH, Aaron",Forecasting in the Presence of Level Shifts,"This article addresses the problem of forecasting time series that are subject to level shifts.  Processes with level shifts possess a nonlinear dependence structure.  Using the stochastic permanent breaks (STOPBREAK) model, I model this nonlinearity in a direct and flexible way that avoids imposing a discrete regime structure.  I apply this model to the rate of price inflation in the United States, which I show is subject to level shifts.  These shifts significantly affect the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts, causing models that assume covariance stationarity to be substantially biased.  Models that do not assume covariance stationarity, such as the random walk, are unbiased but lack precision in periods without shifts.  I show that the STOPBREAK model outperforms several alternative models in an out-of-sample inflation forecasting experiment."

Here, we describe the ocular findings in a case of trisomy 13 to better understand the histogenesis of the rosettes, or tubules, characteristic of the retinal dysplasia associated with this condition.MethodsA full pediatric autopsy was performed of a near term infant who died shortly after birth from multiple congenital anomalies including fused facial-midline structures. A detailed histopathological study of the ocular structures was performed. The expression of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), cellular retinal-binding protein (CRALBP), rod opsin, and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) were studied by immunohistochemistry.ResultsHoloprosencephaly, and a spectrum of anatomical findings characteristic of Patau's syndrome, were found. Cytogenetic studies demonstrated trisomy 13 [47, XY, +13]. The eyes were fused but contained two developed separate lenses. In contrast, the cornea, and angle structures were hypoplastic, and the anterior chamber had failed to form. The retina showed areas of normally laminated neural retina, whereas in other areas it was replaced by numerous neuronal rosettes. Histological and immunohistochemical studies revealed that the rosettes were composed of differentiated retinal neurons and MÃ¼ller cell glia. In normally laminated retina, Shh expression was restricted to retinal-ganglion cells, and to a population of neurons in the inner zone of the outer nuclear layer. In contrast, Shh could not be detected in the dysplastic rosettes.ConclusionThe histopathology of cyclopia appears to be more complex than what may have been previously appreciated. In fact, the terms ""cyclopia"" and ""synophthalmia"" are misnomers as the underlying mechanism is a failure of the eyes to form separately during development. The rosettes found in the dysplastic retina are fundamentally different than those of retinoblastoma, being composed of a variety of differentiated cell types. The dysplastic rosettes are essentially laminated retina failing to establish a polarized orientation, resulting in the formation of tubules. Finally, our findings suggest that defective ganglion cell Shh expression may contribute to the ocular pathology of cyclopia."

An RNA interference screen using APP-CTF [99-residue CTF (C99)]- and Notch-specific Î³-secretase interaction assays identified a unique ErbB2-centered signaling network that was predicted to preferentially govern the proteostasis of APP-C99. Consistently, significantly elevated levels of ErbB2 were confirmed in the hippocampus of human AD brains. We then found that ErbB2 effectively suppressed autophagic flux by physically dissociating Beclin-1 from the Vps34-Vps15 complex independent of its kinase activity. Down-regulation of ErbB2 by CL-387,785 decreased the levels of C99 and secreted amyloid-Î² in cellular, zebrafish, and mouse models of AD, through the activation of autophagy. Oral administration of an ErbB2-targeted CL-387,785 for 3 wk significantly improves the cognitive functions of APP/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice. This work unveils a noncanonical function of ErbB2 in modulating autophagy and establishes ErbB2 as a therapeutic target for AD."
"FOX, Andrew S",The central extended amygdala in fear and anxiety: Closing the gap between mechanistic and neuroimaging research,"Anxiety disorders impose a staggering burden on public health, underscoring the need to develop a deeper understanding of the distributed neural circuits underlying extreme fear and anxiety. Recent work highlights the importance of the central extended amygdala, including the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and neighboring bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST). Anatomical data indicate that the Ce and BST form a tightly interconnected unit, where different kinds of threat-relevant information can be integrated to assemble states of fear and anxiety. Neuroimaging studies show that the Ce and BST are engaged by a broad spectrum of potentially threat-relevant cues. Mechanistic work demonstrates that the Ce and BST are critically involved in organizing defensive responses to a wide range of threats. Studies in rodents have begun to reveal the specific molecules, cells, and microcircuits within the central extended amygdala that underlie signs of fear and anxiety, but the relevance of these tantalizing discoveries to human experience and disease remains unclear. Using a combination of focal perturbations and whole-brain imaging, a new generation of nonhuman primate studies is beginning to close this gap. This work opens the door to discovering the mechanisms underlying neuroimaging measures linked to pathological fear and anxiety, to understanding how the Ce and BST interact with one another and with distal brain regions to govern defensive responses to threat, and to developing improved intervention strategies."
"SCIAMMAS, Roger",Ablation of Transcription Factor IRF4 Promotes Transplant Acceptance by Driving Allogenic CD4+ T Cell Dysfunction,"CD4+ T&nbsp;cells orchestrate immune responses and destruction of allogeneic organ transplants, but how this process is regulated on a transcriptional level remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) was a key transcriptional determinant controlling T&nbsp;cell responses during transplantation. IRF4 deletion in mice resulted in progressive establishment of CD4+ T&nbsp;cell dysfunction and long-term allograft survival. Mechanistically, IRF4 repressed PD-1, Helios, and other molecules associated with T&nbsp;cell dysfunction. In the absence of IRF4, chromatin accessibility and binding of Helios at PD-1 cis-regulatory elements were increased, resulting in enhanced PD-1 expression and CD4+ T&nbsp;cell dysfunction. The dysfunctional state of Irf4-deficient T&nbsp;cells was initially reversible by PD-1 ligand blockade, but it progressively developed into an irreversible state. Hence, IRF4 controls a core regulatory circuit of CD4+ T&nbsp;cell dysfunction, and targeting IRF4 represents a potential therapeutic strategy for achieving transplant acceptance."

"TSOLIS, RenÃ©e M",Utilization of Host Polyamines in Alternatively Activated Macrophages Promotes Chronic Infection by Brucella abortus,"Treatment of intracellular bacterial pathogens with antibiotic therapy often requires a long course of multiple drugs. A barrier to developing strategies that enhance antibiotic efficacy against these pathogens is our poor understanding of the intracellular nutritional environment that maintains bacterial persistence. The intracellular pathogen Brucella abortus survives and replicates preferentially in alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs); however, knowledge of the metabolic adaptations promoting exploitation of this niche is limited. Here we show that one mechanism promoting enhanced survival in AAMs is a shift in macrophage arginine utilization from production of nitric oxide (NO) to biosynthesis of polyamines, induced by interleukin 4 (IL-4)/IL-13 treatment. Production of polyamines by infected AAMs promoted both intracellular survival of B. abortus and chronic infection in mice, as inhibition of macrophage polyamine synthesis or inactivation of the putative putrescine transporter encoded by potIHGF reduced both intracellular survival in AAMs and persistence in mice. These results demonstrate that increased intracellular availability of polyamines induced by arginase-1 expression in IL-4/IL-13-induced AAMs promotes chronic persistence of B. abortus within this niche and suggest that targeting of this pathway may aid in eradicating chronic infection."
"WANG, Aijun",The Differentiation Stage of Transplanted Stem Cells Modulates Nerve Regeneration,"In regenerative medicine applications, the differentiation stage of implanted stem cells must be optimized to control cell fate and enhance therapeutic efficacy. We investigated the therapeutic potential of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells at two differentiation stages on peripheral nerve regeneration. Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) and Schwann cells (NCSC-SCs) derived from iPSCs were used to construct a tissue-engineered nerve conduit that was applied to bridge injured nerves in a rat sciatic nerve transection model. Upon nerve conduit implantation, the NCSC group showed significantly higher electrophysiological recovery at 1 month as well as better gastrocnemius muscle recovery at 5 months than the acellular group, but the NCSC-SC group didn't. Both transplanted NCSCs and NCSC-SCs interacted with newly-growing host axons, while NCSCs showed better survival rate and distribution. The transplanted NCSCs mainly differentiated into Schwann cells with no teratoma formation, and they secreted higher concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor than NCSC-SCs. In conclusion, transplantation of iPSC-NCSCs accelerated functional nerve recovery with the involvement of stem cell differentiation and paracrine signaling. This study unravels the in vivo performance of stem cells during tissue regeneration, and provides a rationale of using appropriate stem cells for regenerative medicine."

"MICHELMORE, Richard W",RNA sequencing provides insights into the evolution of lettuce and the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis,"Different horticultural types of lettuce exhibit tremendous morphological variation. However, the molecular basis for domestication and divergence among the different horticultural types of lettuce remains unknown. Here, we report the RNA sequencing of 240 lettuce accessions sampled from the major horticultural types and wild relatives, generating 1.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms&nbsp;(SNPs). Demographic modeling indicates that there was a single domestication event for lettuce. We identify a list of regions as putative selective sweeps that occurred during domestication and divergence, respectively. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify 5311 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) regulating the expression of 4105 genes, including nine eQTLs regulating genes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis. GWAS for leaf color detects six candidate loci responsible for the variation of anthocyanins in lettuce leaves. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the domestication and the accumulation of anthocyanins in lettuce, and will facilitate the breeding of cultivars with improved nutritional value."

"CHEN, Xi",Distribution of O-Acetylated Sialic Acids among Target Host Tissues for Influenza Virus.,"Sialic acids (Sias) are important glycans displayed on the cells and tissues of many different animals and are frequent targets for binding and modification by pathogens, including influenza viruses. Influenza virus hemagglutinins bind Sias during the infection of their normal hosts, while the encoded neuraminidases and/or esterases remove or modify the Sia to allow virion release or to prevent rebinding. Sias naturally occur in a variety of modified forms, and modified Sias can alter influenza virus host tropisms through their altered interactions with the viral glycoproteins. However, the distribution of modified Sia forms and their effects on pathogen-host interactions are still poorly understood. Here we used probes developed from viral Sia-binding proteins to detect O-acetylated (4-O-acetyl, 9-O-acetyl, and 7,9-O-acetyl) Sias displayed on the tissues of some natural or experimental hosts for influenza viruses. These modified Sias showed highly variable displays between the hosts and tissues examined. The 9-O-acetyl (and 7,9-) modified Sia forms were found on cells and tissues of many hosts, including mice, humans, ferrets, guinea pigs, pigs, horses, dogs, as well as in those of ducks and embryonated chicken egg tissues and membranes, although in variable amounts. The 4-O-acetyl Sias were found in the respiratory tissues of fewer animals, being primarily displayed in the horse and guinea pig, but were not detected in humans or pigs. The results suggest that these Sia variants may influence virus tropisms by altering and selecting their cell interactions. IMPORTANCE Sialic acids (Sias) are key glycans that control or modulate many normal cell and tissue functions while also interacting with a variety of pathogens, including many different viruses. Sias are naturally displayed in a variety of different forms, with modifications at several positions that can alter their functional interactions with pathogens. In addition, Sias are often modified or removed by enzymes such as host or pathogen esterases or sialidases (neuraminidases), and Sia modifications can alter those enzymatic activities to impact pathogen infections. Sia chemical diversity in different hosts and tissues likely alters the pathogen-host interactions and influences the outcome of infection. Here we explored the display of 4-O-acetyl, 9-O-acetyl, and 7,9-O-acetyl modified Sia forms in some target tissues for influenza virus infection in mice, humans, birds, guinea pigs, ferrets, swine, horses, and dogs, which encompass many natural and laboratory hosts of those viruses."

"YU, Hai",Glycan microarray reveal induced IgGs repertoire shift against a dietary carbohydrate in response to rabbit anti-human thymocyte therapy.,"Humans have circulating antibodies against diverse glycans containing N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) due to function-loss mutation of the CMAH gene. This xenogenic non-human carbohydrate is abundant in red meat, xenografts and biotherapeutics. Low levels of diet-derived Neu5Gc is also present on normal human endothelial cells, and together with anti-Neu5Gc antibodies could potentially mediate ""xenosialitis"" chronic-inflammation. Rabbit anti-human thymocyte globulin (ATG) is a drug containing polyclonal IgG glycoproteins commonly used as an immunosuppressant in human transplantation and autoimmune diseases. In type-1 diabetes patients, infusion of Neu5Gc-glycosylated ATG caused increased global anti-Neu5Gc response. Here, for the first time we explore changes in anti-Neu5Gc IgG repertoire following the immunization elicited by ATG, compared with the basal antibodies repertoire that reflect exposure to dietary-Neu5Gc. We used glycan microarrays with multiple Neu5Gc-glycans and controls to elucidate eventual differences in ATG-elicited repertoire, before/after ATG administration and track their kinetics (0, 1, 18 and 24 months). Response of all basal-pre-existing Neu5Gc-specific antibodies rapidly increased. This response peaked at one month post-ATG, with enhanced affinity, then resolved at 18-24 months. Induced-antibodies showed expanded diversity and de-novo recognition of different Neu5Gc-glycans, including endogenous glycolipids, that was further validated by affinity-purified anti-Neu5Gc antibodies from patients' sera. These findings strongly suggest that ATG-induced anti-Neu5Gc IgGs represent a secondary exposure to this dietary carbohydrate-antigen in humans, with immune memory. Given their modified recognition patterns, ATG-evoked anti-Neu5Gc antibodies could potentially mediate biological effects different from pre-existing antibodies."
"TRAINOR, Brian C",Effects of social defeat on paternal behavior and pair bonding behavior in male California mice (Peromyscus californicus),"Male parental care is an important social behavior for several mammalian species. Psychosocial stress is usually found to inhibit maternal behavior, but effects on paternal behavior have been less consistent. We tested the effects of social defeat stress on pair bond formation and paternal behavior in the monogamous California mouse (Peromyscus californicus). Social defeat reduced time spent in a chamber with a stranger female during a partner preference test conducted 24h after pairing, but increased latency to the first litter. In 10min partner preference tests conducted after the birth of pups, both control and stressed males exhibited selective aggression towards stranger females. Unlike prairie voles, side by side contact was not observed in either partner preference test. Stressed male California mice engaged in more paternal behavior than controls and had reduced anxiety-like responses in the open-field test. Defeat stress enhanced prodynorphin and KOR expression in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) but not PVN. Increased KOR signaling has been linked to increased selective aggression in prairie voles. Together the results show that defeat stress enhances behaviors related to parental care and pair bonding in male California mice."

The regulation of adropin expression was then assessed in silico, in cultured human cells, and in animal models.ResultsIn humans, plasma adropin concentrations are inversely related to atherogenic LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in men (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;349), but not in women (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;401). Analysis of hepatic Enho expression in male mice suggests control by the biological clock. Expression is rhythmic, peaking during maximal food consumption in the dark correlating with transcriptional activation by RORÎ±/Î³. The nadir in the light phase coincides with the rest phase and repression by Rev-erb. Plasma adropin concentrations in nonhuman primates (rhesus monkeys) also exhibit peaks coinciding with feeding times (07:00&nbsp;h, 15:00&nbsp;h). The ROR inverse agonists SR1001 and the 7-oxygenated sterols 7-Î²-hydroxysterol and 7-ketocholesterol, or the Rev-erb agonist SR9009, suppress ENHO expression in cultured human HepG2 cells. Consumption of high-cholesterol diets suppress expression of the adropin transcript in mouse liver. However, adropin over expression does not prevent hypercholesterolemia resulting from a high cholesterol diet and/or LDL receptor mutations.ConclusionsIn humans, associations between plasma adropin concentrations and LDL-C suggest a link with hepatic lipid metabolism. Mouse studies suggest that the relationship between adropin and cholesterol metabolism is unidirectional, and predominantly involves suppression of adropin expression by cholesterol and 7-oxygenated sterols. Sensing of fatty acids, cholesterol and oxysterols by the RORÎ±/Î³ ligand-binding domain suggests a plausible functional link between adropin expression and cellular lipid metabolism. Furthermore, the nuclear receptors RORÎ±/Î³ and Rev-erb may couple adropin synthesis with circadian rhythms in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism."

Here we characterize the economic benefits of ecological knowledge through a simple model of fisheries that target a predator (piscivore) and its prey. We solve for the management (harvest) trajectory that maximizes net present value (NPV) for different ecological interactions and initial conditions that represent different levels of exploitation history. Optimal management trajectories generally approached similar harvest levels, but the pathways toward those levels varied considerably by ecological scenario. Application of the wrong harvest trajectory, which would happen if one type of ecological interaction were assumed but in fact another were occurring, generally led to only modest reductions in NPV. However, the risks were not equal across fleets: risks of incurring large losses of NPV and missing management targets were much higher in the fishery targeting piscivores, especially when piscivores were heavily depleted. Our findings suggest that the ecosystem approach might provide the greatest benefits when used to identify system states where management performs poorly with imperfect knowledge of system linkages so that management strategies can be adopted to avoid those states."
"MCKENNEY, Richard J",Cooperative Accumulation of Dynein-Dynactin at Microtubule Minus-Ends Drives Microtubule Network Reorganization,"Cytoplasmic dynein-1 is a minus-end-directed motor protein that transports cargo over long distances and organizes the intracellular microtubule (MT) network. How dynein motor activity is harnessed for these diverse functions remains unknown. Here, we have uncovered a mechanism for how processive dynein-dynactin complexes drive MT-MT sliding, reorganization, and focusing, activities required for mitotic spindle assembly. We find that motors cooperatively accumulate, in limited numbers, at MT minus-ends. Minus-end accumulations drive MT-MT sliding, independent of MT orientation, resulting in the clustering of MT minus-ends. At a mesoscale level, activated dynein-dynactin drives the formation and coalescence of MT asters. Macroscopically, dynein-dynactin activity leads to bulk contraction of millimeter-scale MT networks, suggesting that minus-end accumulations of motors produce network-scale contractile stresses. Our data provide a model for how localized dynein activity is harnessed by cells to produce contractile stresses within the cytoskeleton, for example, during mitotic spindle assembly."

The cell divisions of female meiosis are highly asymmetric and give rise to a large egg and two very small polar bodies that do not contribute to development. These asymmetric divisions are driven by meiotic spindles that are small relative to the size of the egg and have one pole juxtaposed against the cell cortex to promote polar body extrusion. An additional unique feature of female meiosis is that fertilization occurs before extrusion of the second polar body in nearly all animal species. Thus sperm-derived chromosomes are present in the egg during female meiosis. Here, we explore the idea that the asymmetry of female meiosis spatially separates the sperm from the meiotic spindle to prevent detrimental interactions between the spindle and the paternal chromosomes."
"YIU, Glenn C",Comparison of chorioretinal layers in rhesus macaques using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and high-resolution histological sections,"Nonhuman primates are important preclinical models of retinal diseases because they uniquely possess a macula similar to humans. Ocular imaging technologies such as spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) allow noninvasive, in vivo measurements of chorioretinal layers with near-histological resolution. However, the boundaries are based on differences in reflectivity, and detailed correlations with histological tissue layers have not been explored in rhesus macaques, which are widely used for biomedical research. Here, we compare the macular anatomy and thickness measurements of chorioretinal layers in rhesus macaque eyes using SD-OCT and high-resolution histological sections. Images were obtained from methylmethacrylate-embedded histological sections of 6 healthy adult rhesus macaques, and compared with SD-OCT images from 6 age-matched animals. Thicknesses of chorioretinal layers were measured across the central 3â€¯mm macular region using custom semi-automated or manual software segmentation, and compared between the two modalities. We found that histological sections provide better distinction between the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) than SD-OCT imaging. The first hyperreflective band between the external limiting membrane (ELM) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) appears wider on SD-OCT than the junction between photoreceptor inner and outer segments seen on histology. SD-OCT poorly distinguishes Henle nerve fibers from the outer nuclear layer (ONL), while histology correctly identifies these fibers as part of the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Overall, the GCL, inner nuclear layer (INL), and OPL are significantly thicker on histology, especially at the fovea; while the ONL, choriocapillaris (CC), and outer choroid (OC) are thicker on SD-OCT. Our results show that both SD-OCT and high-resolution histological sections allow reliable measurements of chorioretinal layers in rhesus macaques, with distinct advantages for different sublayers. These findings demonstrate the effects of tissue processing on chorioretinal anatomy, and provide normative values for chorioretinal thickness measurements on SD-OCT for future studies of disease models in these nonhuman primates."

Mortality in adult female sturgeon caused by this emergent pathogen results in significant economic losses for the caviar industry. Little is known regarding environmental conditions conducive to V. botryosa infection. This study evaluated the effect of temperature on V. botryosa infectivity and dissemination following intramuscular injection challenge of white sturgeon maintained at 13 or 18&nbsp;Â°C for 40&nbsp;days. Daily mortality was recorded and persistence of the fungus in the livers of moribund and surviving fish was investigated using culture and histopathological analysis. Fish maintained at 18&nbsp;Â°C developed systemic phaeohyphomycosis and had significantly greater mortality than controls and fish maintained at 13&nbsp;Â°C (p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.05). Challenged fish, regardless of temperature, exhibited lesions in multiple organs. However, muscle lesions, angioinvasion, and systemic dissemination were more severe and widespread in fish challenged at the higher temperature. In vitro cytotoxicity of V. botryosa was evaluated in white sturgeon skin (WSSK-1) and epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cell lines inoculated at spore:cell ratios of 1:10, 1:1 and 10:1, then incubated 15, 20 and 25&nbsp;Â°C. Cytotoxicity, as indicated by quantifying the release of lactate dehydrogenase into culture supernatants, increased with increasing spore dose and incubation temperature in both fish cell lines. Findings suggest that temperature significantly influences the development of systemic V. botryosa infection in white sturgeon and that WSSK-1 and EPC cells are suitable in vitro models for the study of host-pathogen interactions between V. botryosa and fish epithelial cells."

"MESGARAN, Mohsen B",Weed control and wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.) responses to metribuzin application rate and timing in Iran,"Field experiments were established at four locations in Iran to evaluate the efficacy of metribuzin in controlling weeds in winter wheat. Metribuzin was applied either post-emergence (POST) or pre-emergence (PRE) at 0, 0.35, 0.52 and 0.70 g a.i. ha-1. At each location three conventionally planted wheat cultivars were tested. In most cases weed control increased with metribuzin rate following a linear or curvilinear trend with an application rate of 0.5 kg ha-1 a.i. providing an acceptable level of control. PRE applied metribuzin resulted in better control of weeds at Ahvaz while POST treatments were more effective at Karaj with no differences between PRE and POST treatments at two other locations (Zabol and Gorgan). Wheat yields increased with metribuzin rate at two locations (Ahvaz and Zabol) or showed minor (Karaj) to no changes (Gorgan) across application rates. Wheat yields were higher in PRE treated plots than in POST at Ahvaz, but lower at Karaj and did not vary at Zabol (with one exception) or Gorgan. Wheat cultivars also varied in their responses to metribuzin application rate or timing. Finally, metribuzin could be applied at 0.5 kg ha-1 a.i. (regardless of application timing) but not at higher rates at Ahvaz and Karaj, although higher rates at Zabol and Gorgan could provide both an acceptable level of weed control and wheat yield gain as well."

In such cases, the pathway taken by epithelial cells can manifest as a whorl pattern described using a variety of terms including hurricane keratitis/keratopathy, vortex keratopathy, whorl keratopathy, cornea verticillata, and at times, named after causative agents as exemplified by amiodarone keratopathy. Here, we briefly discuss the terminology used and the spectrum of conditions that can result in keratopathies with whorl patterns in human patients. We review the manifestations of such patterns in veterinary patients and discuss the state of understanding of the underlying forces that create the whorl distribution of epithelial cells on the ocular surface."

"PLEASURE, David E",Transient activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling reporter in fibrotic scar formation after compression spinal cord injury in adult mice,"After traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), a scar may form with a fibrotic core (fibrotic scar) and surrounding reactive astrocytes (glial scar) at the lesion site. The scar tissue is considered a major obstacle preventing regeneration both as a physical barrier and as a source for secretion of inhibitors of axonal regeneration. Understanding the mechanism of scar formation and how to control it may lead to effective SCI therapies. Using a compression-SCI model on adult transgenic mice, we demonstrate that the canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling reporter TOPgal (TCF/Lef1-lacZ) positive cells appeared at the lesion site by 5 days, peaked on 7 days, and diminished by 14 days post injury. Using various representative cell lineage markers, we demonstrate that, these transiently TOPgal positive cells are a group of Fibronectin(+);GFAP(-) fibroblast-like cells in the core scar region. Some of them are proliferative. These results indicate that Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling may play a key role in fibrotic scar formation after traumatic spinal cord injury."
"BADAWI, Ramsey D",Development and Evaluation of mini-EXPLORER: A Long Axial Field-of-View PET Scanner for Nonhuman Primate Imaging,"We describe a long axial field-of-view (FOV) PET scanner for high-sensitivity and total-body imaging of nonhuman primates and present the physical performance and first phantom and animal imaging results. Methods: The mini-EXPLORER PET scanner was built using the components of a clinical scanner reconfigured with a detector ring diameter of 43.5 cm and an axial length of 45.7 cm. National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU-2 and NU-4 phantoms were used to measure sensitivity and count rate performance. Reconstructed spatial resolution was investigated by imaging a radially stepped point source and a Derenzo phantom. The effect of the wide acceptance angle was investigated by comparing performance with maximum acceptance angles of 14Â°-46Â°. Lastly, an initial assessment of the in vivo performance of the mini-EXPLORER was undertaken with a dynamic 18F-FDG nonhuman primate (rhesus monkey) imaging study. Results: The NU-2 total sensitivity was 5.0%, and the peak noise-equivalent count rate measured with the NU-4 monkey scatter phantom was 1,741 kcps, both obtained using the maximum acceptance angle (46Â°). The NU-4 scatter fraction was 16.5%, less than 1% higher than with a 14Â° acceptance angle. The reconstructed spatial resolution was approximately 3.0 mm at the center of the FOV, with a minor loss in axial spatial resolution (0.5 mm) when the acceptance angle increased from 14Â° to 46Â°. The rhesus monkey 18F-FDG study demonstrated the benefit of the high sensitivity of the mini-EXPLORER, including fast imaging (1-s early frames), excellent image quality (30-s and 5-min frames), and late-time-point imaging (18 h after injection), all obtained at a single bed position that captured the major organs of the rhesus monkey. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the physical performance and imaging capabilities of a long axial FOV PET scanner designed for high-sensitivity imaging of nonhuman primates. Further, the results of this study suggest that a wide acceptance angle can be used with a long axial FOV scanner to maximize sensitivity while introducing only minor trade-offs such as a small increase in scatter fraction and slightly degraded axial spatial resolution."

The source of hyperintensity in postcontrast-T2 FLAIR images is inconsistently reported and has implications for the significance of imaging findings. We hypothesized that the main source of increased signal intensity in postcontrast-T2 FLAIR images would be due to gadolinium leakage into adjacent fluid, and that the resulting gadolinium-induced T1 shortening causes reappearance of fluid hyperintensity, previously nulled on precontrast FLAIR images. A retrospective, descriptive study was carried out comparing T2 weighted, pre- and postcontrast T1 weighted and pre- and postcontrast weighted T2 FLAIR images in a variety of intracranial diseases in dogs and cats. A prospective, experimental, phantom, in vitro study was also done to compare the relative effects of gadolinium concentration on T2 weighted, T1 weighted, and FLAIR images. A majority of hyperintensities on postcontrast-T2 FLAIR images that were not present on precontrast FLAIR images were also present on precontrast T2 weighted images, and were consistent with normal or pathological fluid filled structures. Phantom imaging demonstrated increased sensitivity of FLAIR sequences to low concentrations of gadolinium compared to T1 weighted sequences. Apparent contrast enhancement on postcontrast-T2 FLAIR images often reflects leakage of gadolinium across normal or pathology specific barriers into fluid-filled structures, and hyperintensity may therefore represent normal fluid structures as well as pathological tissues. Findings indicated that postcontrast-T2 FLAIR images may provide insight into integrity of biological structures such as the ependymal and subarachnoid barriers that may be relevant to progression of disease."

"TELL, Lisa A",Evaluation of Proctophyllodes huitzilopochtlii on feathers from Annaâ€™s (Calypte anna) and Black-chinned (Archilochus alexandri) Hummingbirds: Prevalence assessment and imaging analysis using light and tabletop scanning electron microscopy,"Proctophyllodes huitzilopochtlii Atyeo &amp; Braasch 1966 (Acariformes: Astigmata: Proctophyllodidae), a feather mite, was found on feathers collected from five hummingbird species in California. This mite has not been previously documented on feathers from Anna's (Calypte anna [Lesson 1829]) or Black-chinned (Archilochus alexandri [Bourcier &amp; Mulsant 1846]) Hummingbirds. A total of 753 hummingbirds were evaluated for the presence of mites by species (Allen's n = 112; Anna's n = 500; Black-chinned n = 122; Rufous n = 18; Calliope n = 1), sex (males n = 421; females n = 329; 3 unidentified), and age (juvenile n = 199; after-hatch-year n = 549; 5 unidentified). Of these 753 hummingbirds evaluated, mites were present on the rectrices of 40.9% of the birds. Significantly more Anna's Hummingbirds were positive for rectricial mites (59.2%) compared with 8.2% of Black-chinned, 0.9% of Allen's, 5.6% of Rufous Hummingbirds, and 0% for Calliope (p-value < 0.0001). Across all hummingbird species, male hummingbirds (44.9%) had a higher prevalence of rectricial mites compared to female hummingbirds (36.2%; p-value = 0.004), while juvenile hummingbirds (46.2%) had a non-significantly higher prevalence compared to after-hatch-year hummingbirds (39.0%; p-value = 0.089). On average, the percentage of the long axis of the rachis occupied by mites for the outer rectrices (R4 and R5) was 19%, compared to 11% for inner rectrices (R1 and R2), a significant difference (p-value = <0.0001). There was a marginal lack of significance for symmetrical distribution of tail mites with the mean left side percentage of long axis of the rachis occupied by mites being 16% and very close to the mean right side score of 18% (p-value = 0.003). The identification of the feather mite species was based on light microscopic morphometry, and mite distribution on feathers was further evaluated using tabletop scanning electron microscopy (TSEM). The hummingbird-feather mite relationship is not well understood, but the specialized TSEM technique may be especially useful in examining natural positioning and developmental aspects of the mites since it allows in situ feather examination of live mites."
"LEBRILLA, Carlito B","Purification, characterization, and Nâ€glycosylation of recombinant butyrylcholinesterase from transgenic rice cell suspension cultures","Recombinant butyrylcholinesterase produced in a metabolically regulated transgenic rice cell culture (rrBChE) was purified to produce a highly pure (95%), active form of enzyme. The developed downstream process uses common manufacturing friendly operations including tangential flow filtration, anion-exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography to obtain a process recovery of 42% active rrBChE. The purified rrBChE was then characterized to confirm its comparability to the native human form of the molecule (hBChE). The recombinant and native enzyme demonstrated comparable enzymatic behavior and had an identical amino acid sequence. However, rrBChE differs in that it contains plant-type complex N-glycans, including an Î±-1,3 linked core fucose, and a Î²-1,2 xylose, and lacking a terminal sialic acid. Despite this difference, rrBChE is demonstrated to be an effective stoichiometric bioscavenger for five different organophosphorous nerve agents in vitro. Together, the efficient downstream processing scheme and functionality of rrBChE confirm its promise as a cost-effective alternative to hBChE for prophylactic and therapeutic use."
"THOMPSON, George R",HIV latency is reversed by ACSS2-driven histone crotonylation,"Eradication of HIV-1 (HIV) is hindered by stable viral reservoirs. Viral latency is epigenetically regulated. While the effects of histone acetylation and methylation at the HIV long-terminal repeat (LTR) have been described, our knowledge of the proviral epigenetic landscape is incomplete. We report that a previously unrecognized epigenetic modification of the HIV LTR, histone crotonylation, is a regulator of HIV latency. Reactivation of latent HIV was achieved following the induction of histone crotonylation through increased expression of the crotonyl-CoA-producing enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2). This reprogrammed the local chromatin at the HIV LTR through increased histone acetylation and reduced histone methylation. Pharmacologic inhibition or siRNA knockdown of ACSS2 diminished histone crotonylation-induced HIV replication and reactivation. ACSS2 induction was highly synergistic in combination with either a protein kinase C agonist (PEP005) or a histone deacetylase inhibitor (vorinostat) in reactivating latent HIV. In the SIV-infected nonhuman primate model of AIDS, the expression of ACSS2 was significantly induced in intestinal mucosa in vivo, which correlated with altered fatty acid metabolism. Our study links the HIV/SIV infection-induced fatty acid enzyme ACSS2 to HIV latency and identifies histone lysine crotonylation as a novel epigenetic regulator for HIV transcription that can be targeted for HIV eradication."
"MCLARTY, Ehren M",Aberrant migration and surgical removal of a heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) from the femoral artery of a cat,A cat was evaluated for an acute-onset of right pelvic limb paresis. Thoracic radiographs revealed normal cardiac size and tortuous pulmonary arteries. Abdominal ultrasound identified a heartworm (HW) extending from the caudal abdominal aorta into the right external iliac artery and right femoral artery. The cat was HW-antigen positive. Echocardiography revealed a HW within the right branch of the main pulmonary artery and evidence of pulmonary hypertension. An agitated-saline contrast echocardiogram revealed a small right to left intracardiac shunt at the level of the atria. Surgical removal of the HW was performed with no substantial postoperative complications. There was return of blood flow and improved motor function to the limb. The cat remains mildly paretic on the affected limb with no other clinical signs.

"OZONOFF, Sally J",Prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides and risk of autism spectrum disorders and other non-typical development at 3 years in a high-risk cohort,"IntroductionOrganophosphates are widely used pesticides that have been shown to affect child neurodevelopment. Previous studies that explored their potential effects on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) relied either on proxies of external exposure or on questionnaires completed by the parents to identify autism-like behaviors but did not provide a clinical diagnosis of ASD.AimsWe studied the associations between prenatal biologic markers for exposure to organophosphate pesticides and the risk of having a child with ASD or other developmental concerns (ODC).MethodWe analyzed 203 mother-child pairs of the ongoing MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies - Learning Early Signs) mother-child cohort, which enrolls mothers who are either pregnant or planning a pregnancy and whose expected child has an elevated risk to develop ASD. Seven metabolites of organophosphate pesticides were assessed in repeated urine samples collected during pregnancy. At 36 months, children were assessed with intruments measuring cognitive function and adaptive behaviors, and with two gold-standard diagnostic instruments for ASD: the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. Children were classified in one of the following groups: ASD (nâ€¯=â€¯46), ODC (nâ€¯=â€¯55) and typically developing (TD, nâ€¯=â€¯102).ResultsAfter adjustment for potential confounders, organophosphate metabolite concentrations were not associated with an increased risk of ASD or ODC when boys and girls were studied together. After stratification by sex, dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP) pregnancy concentration tended to be associated with an increased ASD risk among girls (OR for a doubling in the DMTP concentration: 1.64 (95%CI, 0.95; 2.82)) but not among boys (OR: 0.84, 95%CI: 0.63; 1.11).DiscussionThis is the first study of clinically confirmed diagnoses of ASD that utilized repeated measurements of organophosphate metabolites during pregnancy to explore the associations between these pesticides and ASD risk in children. The association we observed among girls, as well as the lack of association in boys, need to be replicated in further studies with similar design and larger sample size. In light of the higher baseline risk for ASD in this cohort, generalizability to children lacking a first degree relative affected by ASD is unknown."
"FORREST, Alexander L",Snowmelt Timing as a Determinant of Lake Inflow Mixing,"Snowmelt is a significant source of carbon, nutrient, and sediment loads to many mountain lakes. The mixing conditions of snowmelt inflows, which are heavily dependent on the interplay between snowmelt and lake thermal regime, dictate the fate of these loads within lakes and their ultimate impact on lake ecosystems. We use five decades of data from Lake Tahoe, a 600 year residence-time lake where snowmelt has little influence on lake temperature, to characterize the snowmelt mixing response to a range of climate conditions. Using stream discharge and lake profile data (1968â€“2017), we find that the proportion of annual snowmelt entering the lake prior to the onset of stratification increases as annual snowpack decreases, ranging from about 50% in heavy-snow years to close to 90% in warm, dry years. Accordingly, in 8 recent years (2010â€“2017) where hourly inflow buoyancy and discharge could be quantified, we find that decreased snowpack similarly increases the proportion of annual snowmelt entering the lake at weak to positive buoyancy. These responses are due to the stronger effect of winter precipitation conditions on streamflow timing and temperature than on lake stratification, and point toward increased nearshore and near-surface mixing of inflows in low-snowpack years. The response of inflow mixing conditions to snowpack is apparent when isolating temperature effects on snowpack. Snowpack levels are decreasing due to warming temperatures during winter precipitation. Thus, our findings suggest that climate change may lead to increased deposition of inflow loads in the ecologically dynamic littoral zone of high-residence time, snowmelt-fed lakes."

However, the overwhelming majority of preclinical investigations examining the behavioral effects of KOR antagonists have been in male rodents. Here, we examined the effects of the long-acting KOR antagonist nor-binaltophimine (norBNI) on immobility in the forced swim test in males and females of two different rodent species (C57Bl/6J and California mice). Consistent with previous reports, norBNI (10 mg/kg) decreased immobility in the forced swim test for male C57Bl/6J and California mice. Surprisingly, dose-response studies in female C57Bl/6J and California mice showed that norBNI did not reduce immobility. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed that metabolism and brain concentrations of norBNI were similar in male and female C57Bl/6J. In the nucleus accumbens of male but not female C57Bl/6J, norBNI increased phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), a putative mechanism for norBNI action. However, no differences in pJNK were observed in male or female California mice. Together, these results suggest that immobility in the forced swim test is less dependent on endogenous KOR signaling in female rodents and highlight the importance of examining the effects of possible therapeutic agents in both males and females."

"POST, Eric",Acceleration of phenological advance and warming with latitude over the past century,"In the Northern Hemisphere, springtime events are frequently reported as advancing more rapidly at higher latitudes, presumably due to an acceleration of warming with latitude. However, this assumption has not been investigated in an analytical framework that simultaneously examines acceleration of warming with latitude while accounting for variation in phenological time series characteristics that might also co-vary with latitude. We analyzed 743 phenological trend estimates spanning 86 years and 42.6 degrees of latitude in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as rates of Northern Hemisphere warming over the same period and latitudinal range. We detected significant patterns of co-variation in phenological time series characteristics that may confound estimates of the magnitude of variation in trends with latitude. Notably, shorter and more recent time series tended to produce the strongest phenological trends, and these also tended to be from higher latitude studies. However, accounting for such variation only slightly modified the relationship between rates of phenological advance and latitude, which was highly significant. Furthermore, warming has increased non-linearly with latitude over the past several decades, most strongly since 1998 and northward of 59Â°N latitude. The acceleration of warming with latitude has likely contributed to an acceleration of phenological advance along the same gradient."
"WULFF, Heike",A multiplatform strategy for the discovery of conventional monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3,"Identifying monoclonal antibodies that block human voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) is a challenging endeavor exacerbated by difficulties in producing recombinant ion channel proteins in amounts that support drug discovery programs. We have developed a general strategy to address this challenge by combining high-level expression of recombinant VGICs in Tetrahymena thermophila with immunization of phylogenetically diverse species and unique screening tools that allow deep-mining for antibodies that could potentially bind functionally important regions of the protein. Using this approach, we targeted human Kv1.3, a voltage-gated potassium channel widely recognized as a therapeutic target for the treatment of a variety of T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases. Recombinant Kv1.3 was used to generate and recover 69 full-length anti-Kv1.3&nbsp;mAbs from immunized chickens and llamas, of which 10 were able to inhibit Kv1.3 current. Select antibodies were shown to be potent (IC50<10&nbsp;nM) and specific for Kv1.3 over related Kv1 family members, hERG and hNav1.5."
"JI, Peng","Substituting oat hay or maize silage for portion of alfalfa hay affects growth performance, ruminal fermentation, and nutrient digestibility of weaned calves","ObjectiveThe impact of forage feeding strategy on growth performance, ruminal fermentation and nutrient digestibility in post-weaning calves was investigated.MethodsForty-five female Holstein calves (body weight [BW] = 79.79Â±0.38 kg) were enrolled in the 35-d study at one week after weaning and randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatments. All diets were fed as total mixed ration containing 60% (dry matter [DM] basis) of basal starter feed and 40% (DM basis) of forage, but varied in composition of forage source including i) alfalfa (40% DM, AH); ii) alfalfa hay (26.7% DM)+oat hay (13.3% DM; OH); iii) alfalfa hay (26.7% DM)+corn silage (13.3% DM; WS).ResultsDry matter intake was not different among treatment groups (p>0.05). However, BW (p<0.05) and average daily gain (p<0.05) of calves fed AH and OH were greater than WS-fed calves, whereas heart girth was greater in OH-fed calves than those fed AH and WS (p<0.05). Ruminal fermentation parameters including proportion of butyric acid, acetated-to-propionate ratio, concentration of total volatile fatty acid, protozoal protein, bacterial protein, and microbial protein in rumen were the highest in OH (p<0.05) and the lowest in WS. Compared with the AH and WS, feeding oat hay to postweaning calves increased crude protein digestibility (p<0.05), and decreased duration of diarrhea (p<0.05) and fecal index (p<0.05).ConclusionOur results suggested that partially replacing alfalfa hay with oat hay improved ruminal fermentation, nitrogen utilization, and reduced incidence of diarrhea in post-weaning dairy calves."

"LEACH, Kent",Nondestructive assessment of collagen hydrogel cross-linking using time-resolved autofluorescence imaging,"We investigate the use of a fiber-based, multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) system to nondestructively monitor changes in mechanical properties of collagen hydrogels caused by controlled application of widely used cross-linking agents, glutaraldehyde (GTA) and ribose. Postcross-linking, fluorescence lifetime images are acquired prior to the hydrogels being processed by rheological or tensile testing to directly probe gel mechanical properties. To preserve the sterility of the ribose-treated gels, FLIm is performed inside a biosafety cabinet (BSC). A pairwise correlation analysis is used to quantify the relationship between mean hydrogel fluorescence lifetimes and the storage or Young's moduli of the gels. In the GTA study, we observe strong and specific correlations between fluorescence lifetime and the storage and Young's moduli. Similar correlations are not observed in the ribose study and we postulate a reason for this. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of FLIm to longitudinally monitor dynamic cross-link formation. The strength of the GTA correlations and deployment of our fiber-based FLIm system inside the aseptic environment of a BSC suggests that this technique may be a valuable tool for the tissue engineering community where longitudinal assessment of tissue construct maturation in vitro is highly desirable."

"TURELLI, Michael",Rapid Global Spread of wRi-like Wolbachia across Multiple Drosophila,"Maternally transmitted Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, and Cardinium bacteria are common in insects [1], but their interspecific spread is poorly understood. Endosymbionts can spread rapidly within host species by manipulating host reproduction, as typified by the&nbsp;global spread of wRi Wolbachia observed in Drosophila simulans [2, 3]. However, because Wolbachia cannot survive outside host cells, spread between distantly related host species requires horizontal transfers that are presumably rare [4-7]. Here, we document spread of wRi-like Wolbachia among eight highly diverged Drosophila hosts (10-50 million years) over only about 14,000 years (5,000-27,000). Comparing 110 wRi-like genomes, we find â‰¤0.02% divergence from the wRi variant that spread rapidly through California populations of D.&nbsp;simulans. The&nbsp;hosts include both globally invasive species (D.&nbsp;simulans, D.&nbsp;suzukii, and D.&nbsp;ananassae) and&nbsp;narrowly distributed Australian endemics (D.&nbsp;anomalata and D.&nbsp;pandora) [8]. Phylogenetic analyses that include mtDNA genomes indicate introgressive transfer of wRi-like Wolbachia between closely related species D.&nbsp;ananassae, D.&nbsp;anomalata, and D.&nbsp;pandora but no horizontal transmission within species. Our analyses suggest D.&nbsp;ananassae as the&nbsp;Wolbachia source for the recent wRi invasion of&nbsp;D.&nbsp;simulans and D.&nbsp;suzukii as the source of Wolbachia in its sister species D.&nbsp;subpulchrella. Although six of these wRi-like variants cause strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, two cause no detectable reproductive effects, indicating that pervasive mutualistic effects [9, 10] complement the reproductive manipulations for which Wolbachia are best&nbsp;known. ""Super spreader"" variants like wRi may be&nbsp;particularly useful for controlling insect pests&nbsp;and vector-borne diseases with Wolbachia transinfections [11]."
"LI, Su-Ting T",Pediatric Program Leadership's Contribution Toward Resident Wellness,"BackgroundResidency program leaders are required to support resident well-being, but often they do not receive training in how to do so.ObjectiveTo determine frequency in which program leadership provides support for resident well-being, comfort in supporting resident well-being, and factors associated with need for additional training in supporting resident well-being.MethodsNational cross-sectional web-based survey in June 2015 of pediatric program directors, associate program directors, and coordinators about their experiences supporting resident well-being. Univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics compared responses between groups. Generalized linear modeling, adjusting for program region, size, program leadership role, and number of years in role determined factors associated with need for additional training.ResultsThe response rate was 39.3% (322/820). Most respondents strongly agreed that supporting resident well-being is an important part of their role, but few reported supporting resident well-being as part of their job description. Most reported supporting residents' clinical, personal, and health issues at least annually, and in some cases weekly, with 72% spending >10%of their time on resident well-being. Most program leaders desired more training. After adjusting for level of comfort in dealing with resident well-being issues, program leaders more frequently exposed to resident well-being issues were more likely to desire additional training (Pâ€‰<â€‰.02).ConclusionsProgram leaders spend a significant amount of time supporting resident well-being. Although they think that supporting resident well-being is an important part of their job, opportunities exist for developing program leaders through including resident wellness on job descriptions and training program leaders how to support resident well-being."

"EVINER, Valerie",Ways forward for resilience research in agroecosystems,"Agroecosystems are on both the receiving and contributing ends of increasingly demanding climatic and environmental conditions. Maintaining productive systems under resource scarcity and multiplicative stresses requires precise monitoring and systems-scale planning. By incorporating ecological resilience into agroecosystems research we can gain valuable insight into agroecosystem identity, change, responsivity, and performance under stress, but only if we move away from resilience as a mere touchstone concept. Using the productivity, stability, resistance, and recovery of system processes as a basic framework for resilience monitoring, we propose quantitative research approaches to tackle the continuing lack of biophysical, field-scale indicators needed to lend insight into dynamic resilience variables and mechanisms. We emphasize the importance of considering productive functions, sources of system regulation and disturbance, and cross-scale interactions when applying resilience theory to agroecosystems. Agroecosystem resilience research requires understanding of multiple scales and speeds of influence both above and below the focal scale. When these considerations are addressed, resilience theory can add tangible value to agroecosystems research, both for the purposes of monitoring current systems and of planning future systems that can reconcile productivity and sustainability goals."

"ASHWOOD, Paul",Differential immune responses and microbiota profiles in children with autism spectrum disorders and co-morbid gastrointestinal symptoms,"ObjectivesMany studies have reported the increased presence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Altered microbiome profiles, pro-inflammatory responses and impaired intestinal permeability have been observed in children with ASD and co-morbid GI symptoms, yet few studies have compared these findings to ASD children without GI issues or similarly aged typical developing children. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are biological signatures in terms of immune dysfunction and microbiota composition in children with ASD with GI symptoms.MethodsChildren were enrolled in one of four groups: ASD and GI symptoms of irregular bowel habits (ASDGI), children with ASD but without current or previous GI symptoms (ASDNoGI), typically developing children with GI symptoms (TDGI) and typically developing children without current or previous GI symptoms (TDNoGI). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from the blood, stimulated and assessed for cytokine production, while stool samples were analyzed for microbial composition.ResultsFollowing Toll-Like receptor (TLR)-4 stimulation, the ASDGI group produced increased levels of mucosa-relevant cytokines including IL-5, IL-15 and IL-17 compared to ASDNoGI. The production of the regulatory cytokine TGFÎ²1 was decreased in the ASDGI group compared with both the ASDNoGI and TDNoGI groups. Analysis of the microbiome at the family level revealed differences in microbiome composition between ASD and TD children with GI symptoms; furthermore, a predictive metagenome functional content analysis revealed that pathways were differentially represented between ASD and TD subjects, independently of the presence of GI symptoms. The ASDGI also showed an over-representation of the gene encoding zonulin, a molecule regulating gut permeability, compared to the other groups.ConclusionsOverall our findings suggest that children with ASD who experience GI symptoms have an imbalance in their immune response, possibly influenced by or influencing metagenomic changes, and may have a propensity to impaired gut barrier function which may contribute to their symptoms and clinical outcome."

Photobacterium damselae Î±2-6-sialyltransferase (Pd2,6ST) was shown previously to have Î±2-6-specific, but weak, sialidase activity. Here, we develop a high-throughput blue-white colony screening method to identify Pd2,6ST mutants with improved Î±2-6-sialidase activity from mutant libraries generated by sequential saturation mutagenesis. A triple mutant (Pd2,6ST S232L/T356S/W361F) has been identified with 100-fold improved activity, high Î±2-6-sialyl linkage selectivity, and ability to cleave two common sialic acid forms, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). It is a valuable tool for sialoglycan structural analysis and functional characterization. The sequential saturation mutagenesis and screening strategy developed here can be explored to evolve other linkage-specific neoglycosidases from the corresponding glycosyltransferases."
"KLIEBENSTEIN, Daniel J",Comparison of the Relative Potential for Epigenetic and Genetic Variation To Contribute to Trait Stability,"The theoretical ability of epigenetic variation to influence the heritable variation of complex traits is gaining traction in the study of adaptation. This theory posits that epigenetic marks can control adaptive phenotypes but the relative potential of epigenetic variation in comparison to genetic variation in these traits is not presently understood. To compare the potential of epigenetic and genetic variation in adaptive traits, we analyzed the influence of DNA methylation variation on the accumulation of chemical defense compounds glucosinolates from the order Brassicales. Several decades of work on glucosinolates has generated extensive knowledge about their synthesis, regulation, genetic variation and contribution to fitness establishing this pathway as a model pathway for complex adaptive traits. Using high-throughput phenotyping with a randomized block design of ddm1 derived Arabidopsis thaliana epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Lines, we measured the correlation between DNA methylation variation and mean glucosinolate variation and within line stochastic variation. Using this information, we identified epigenetic Quantitative Trait Loci that contained specific Differentially Methylated Regions associated with glucosinolate traits. This showed that variation in DNA methylation correlates both with levels and variance of glucosinolates and flowering time with trait-specific loci. By conducting a meta-analysis comparing the results to different genetically variable populations, we conclude that the influence of DNA methylation variation on these adaptive traits is much lower than the corresponding impact of standing genetic variation. As such, selective pressure on these traits should mainly affect standing genetic variation to lead to adaptation."
"TU, Shin-Ping",Developing measures to assess constructs from the Inner Setting domain of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research,"BackgroundScientists and practitioners alike need reliable, valid measures of contextual factors that influence implementation. Yet, few existing measures demonstrate reliability or validity. To meet this need, we developed and assessed the psychometric properties of measures of several constructs within the Inner Setting domain of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).MethodsWe searched the literature for existing measures for the 7 Inner Setting domain constructs (Culture Overall, Culture Stress, Culture Effort, Implementation Climate, Learning Climate, Leadership Engagement, and Available Resources). We adapted items for the healthcare context, pilot-tested the adapted measures in 4 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and implemented the revised measures in 78 FQHCs in the 7 states (Nâ€‰=â€‰327 respondents) with a focus on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening practices. To psychometrically assess our measures, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis models (CFA; structural validity), assessed inter-item consistency (reliability), computed scale correlations (discriminant validity), and calculated inter-rater reliability and agreement (organization-level construct reliability and validity).ResultsCFAs for most constructs exhibited good model fit (CFIâ€‰>â€‰0.90, TLIâ€‰>â€‰0.90, SRMRâ€‰<â€‰0.08, RMSEAâ€‰<â€‰0.08), with almost all factor loadings exceeding 0.40. Scale reliabilities ranged from good (0.7â€‰â‰¤â€‰Î±â€‰<â€‰0.9) to excellent (Î±â€‰â‰¥â€‰0.9). Scale correlations fell below 0.90, indicating discriminant validity. Inter-rater reliability and agreement were sufficiently high to justify measuring constructs at the clinic-level.ConclusionsOur findings provide psychometric evidence in support of the CFIR Inner Setting measures. Our findings also suggest the Inner Setting measures from individuals can be aggregated to represent the clinic-level. Measurement of the Inner Setting constructs can be useful in better understanding and predicting implementation in FQHCs and can be used to identify targets of strategies to accelerate and enhance implementation efforts in FQHCs."

"SACK, Jon T",Azideâ€“Alkyne Click Conjugation on Quantum Dots by Selective Copper Coordination,"Functionalization of nanocrystals is essential for their practical application, but synthesis on nanocrystal surfaces is limited by incompatibilities with certain key reagents. The copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition is among the most useful methods for ligating molecules to surfaces, but has been largely useless for semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) because Cu+ ions quickly and irreversibly quench QD fluorescence. To discover nonquenching synthetic conditions for Cu-catalyzed click reactions on QD surfaces, we developed a combinatorial fluorescence assay to screen >2000 reaction conditions to maximize cycloaddition efficiency while minimizing QD quenching. We identify conditions for complete coupling without significant quenching, which are compatible with common QD polymer surfaces and various azide/alkyne pairs. Based on insight from the combinatorial screen and mechanistic studies of Cu coordination and quenching, we find that superstoichiometric concentrations of Cu can promote full coupling if accompanied by ligands that selectively compete with the Cu from the QD surface but allow it to remain catalytically active. Applied to the conjugation of a K+ channel-specific peptidyl toxin to CdSe/ZnS QDs, we synthesize unquenched QD conjugates and image their specific and voltage-dependent affinity for K+ channels in live cells."

"CLANCY, Colleen E",Determinants of Isoform-Specific Gating Kinetics of hERG1 Channel: Combined Experimental and Simulation Study,"IKr is the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, the ion current largely responsible for the repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Inherited forms of long QT syndrome (LQTS) (Lees-Miller et al., 1997) in humans are linked to functional modifications in the Kv11.1 (hERG) ion channel and potentially life threatening arrhythmias. There is little doubt now that hERG-related component of IKr in the heart depends on the tetrameric (homo- or hetero-) channels formed by two alternatively processed isoforms of hERG, termed hERG1a and hERG1b. Isoform composition (hERG1a- vs. the b-isoform) has recently been reported to alter pharmacologic responses to some hERG blockers and was proposed to be an essential factor pre-disposing patients for drug-induced QT prolongation. Very little is known about the gating and pharmacological properties of two isoforms in heart membranes. For example, how gating mechanisms of the hERG1a channels differ from that of hERG1b is still unknown. The mechanisms by which hERG 1a/1b hetero-tetramers contribute to function in the heart, or what role hERG1b might play in disease are all questions to be answered. Structurally, the two isoforms differ only in the N-terminal region located in the cytoplasm: hERG1b is 340 residues shorter than hERG1a and the initial 36 residues of hERG1b are unique to this isoform. In this study, we combined electrophysiological measurements for HEK cells, kinetics and structural modeling to tease out the individual contributions of each isoform to Action Potential formation and then make predictions about the effects of having various mixture ratios of the two isoforms. By coupling electrophysiological data with computational kinetic modeling, two proposed mechanisms of hERG gating in two homo-tetramers were examined. Sets of data from various experimental stimulation protocols (HEK cells) were analyzed simultaneously and fitted to Markov-chain models (M-models). The minimization procedure presented here, allowed assessment of suitability of different Markov model topologies and the corresponding parameters that describe the channel kinetics. The kinetics modeling pointed to key differences in the gating kinetics that were linked to the full channel structure. Interactions between soluble domains and the transmembrane part of the channel appeared to be critical determinants of the gating kinetics. The structures of the full channel in the open and closed states were compared for the first time using the recent Cryo-EM resolved structure for full open hERG channel and an homology model for the closed state, based on the highly homolog EAG1 channel. Key potential interactions which emphasize the importance of electrostatic interactions between N-PAS cap, S4-S5, and C-linker are suggested based on the structural analysis. The derived kinetic parameters were later used in higher order models of cells and tissue to track down the effect of varying the ratios of hERG1a and hERG1b on cardiac action potentials and computed electrocardiograms. Simulations suggest that the recovery from inactivation of hERG1b may contribute to its physiologic role of this isoform in the action potential. Finally, the results presented here contribute to the growing body of evidence that hERG1b significantly affects the generation of the cardiac Ikr and plays an important role in cardiac electrophysiology. We highlight the importance of carefully revisiting the Markov models previously proposed in order to properly account for the relative abundance of the hERG1 a- and b- isoforms."
"MCPHERSON, John D",Molecular cytogenetic delineation of the critical deleted region in the 5q- syndrome.,"The 5q- syndrome is a distinct type of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characterised by refractory anaemia, morphological abnormalities of megakaryocytes, and del(5q) as the sole cytogenetic abnormality. In contrast to patients with therapy-related MDS with 5q deletions, 5q- syndrome patients have a favourable prognosis and a low rate of transformation to acute leukaemia. We have previously delineated a common deleted region of 5.6 Mb between the gene for fibroblast growth factor acidic (FGF1) and the subunit of interleukin 12 (IL12B) in two patients with 5q- syndrome and small deletions, del(5)(q31q33). The present study used fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of these and a third 5q- syndrome patient with a small deletion, del(5)(q33q34), to refine further the critical deleted region. This resulted in the narrowing of the common deleted region within 5q31.3-5q33 to approximately 3 Mb, flanked by the adrenergic receptor beta 2 (ADRB2) and IL/2B genes. The common region of loss in these three 5q- syndrome patients includes the macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R), secreted protein, acidic, cysteine-rich (SPARC), and glutamate receptor (GR1A1) genes. This 5q- syndrome critical region is telomeric to and distinct from the other critical regions on 5q associated with MDS and acute myeloid leukaemia."

DNA methylation is epigenetically responsive to daily rhythms, as a subset of CpG dinucleotides in brain exhibit diurnal rhythmic methylation. Here, we show a major genetic effect on rhythmic methylation in a mouse Snord116 deletion model of the imprinted disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). More than 23,000 diurnally rhythmic CpGs are identified in wild-type cortex, with nearly all lost or phase-shifted in PWS. Circadian dysregulation of a second imprinted Snord cluster at the Temple/Kagami-Ogata syndrome locus is observed at the level of methylation, transcription, and chromatin, providing mechanistic evidence of cross-talk. Genes identified by diurnal epigenetic changes in PWS mice overlapped rhythmic and PWS-specific genes in human brain and are enriched for PWS-relevant phenotypes and pathways. These results support the proposed evolutionary relationship between imprinting and sleep, and suggest possible chronotherapy in the treatment of PWS and related disorders."

Analysis of epidermal lipids indicates that linoleate is converted to a trihydroxy derivative by hydrolysis of an epoxy-hydroxy precursor. We evaluated different epoxide hydrolase (EH) enzymes in the hydrolysis of skin-relevant fatty acid epoxides and compared the products to those of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. In the absence of enzyme, exposure to pH 5 or pH 6 at 37Â°C for 30 min hydrolyzed fatty acid allylic epoxyalcohols to four trihydroxy products. By contrast, human soluble EH [sEH (EPHX2)] and human or murine epoxide hydrolase-3 [EH3 (EPHX3)] hydrolyzed cis or trans allylic epoxides to single diastereomers, identical to the major isomers detected in epidermis. Microsomal EH [mEH (EPHX1)] was inactive with these substrates. At low substrate concentrations (<10 Î¼M), EPHX2 hydrolyzed 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) at twice the rate of the epidermal epoxyalcohol, 9R,10R-trans-epoxy-11E-13R-hydroxy-octadecenoic acid, whereas human or murine EPHX3 hydrolyzed the allylic epoxyalcohol at 31-fold and 39-fold higher rates, respectively. These data implicate the activities of EPHX2 and EPHX3 in production of the linoleate triols detected as end products of the 12R-LOX pathway in the epidermis and implicate their functioning in formation of the mammalian water permeability barrier."

"CHIANG, Shirley",Scanning Tunneling Microscopy of molecules on metals,"Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), a relatively new technique capable of observing atom-sized features, has recently made significant inroads into observations of molecules on surfaces. At first thought it might seem that a microscopy which can image atoms should be trivially capable of observing molecules. There are several reasons why this is not the case. First, because the atoms within a molecule are already bonded to one another, molecules are frequently only weakly affixed to surfaces and other molecules, and consequently may be mobile at room temperature. A second difficulty arises because most molecules are electrically insulating. Since STM detects atoms by sensing a small flow of current between an atomically sharp probe and the sample, a perfectly insulating molecule might be expected to be invisible with the STM. Luckily, it is often found that chemical interactions between molecules and a metal surface are sufficiently strong to change the electrical properties enough so that thin layers of insulating molecules are easily detected. Another significant problem involves the possibility that the tunneling tip is brought so close to the conducting support surface that molecules are essentially squeezed out of the vacuum gap and remain undetected. These difficulties have caused a significant delay in the success of applications of STM to high resolution molecular imaging, as opposed to early STM successes with metal and semiconductor surfaces. Our data indicates that each of these problems can be important, and that steps can be taken to reduce or eliminate them. We illustrate the recent success of STM at this new task with the imaging of a few organic molecules on metal surfaces. Our first studies of molecules involved ordered coadsorbed CO and benzene on Rh(111) surfaces. This system shows a 3x3 structure in low energy electron diffraction (LEED) for a 2/1 CO/benzene ratio (1) and a c(2âˆš3 x 4)rect structure for a 1/1 ratio (2). For the 3x3 structure, it was found that benzene was easily imaged while the CO image contrast was substantially smaller (3). In addition to imaging well-ordered terraces, we were able to observe benzene binding near step edges, diffusion (possibly induced by the STM) of benzene at defects, and internal structure within the benzene molecules. The sharpest images possessed only 3-fold symmetry, presumably because 3 of the 6 C-C bonds are above substrate metal atoms. Further reductions in the image symmetry associated with asymmetric tips were frequently observed. Subsequent observations of the c(2 âˆš3 x4)rect structure revealed the three domains present for this structure and frequent domain changes at step edges. For this system we also found small protrusions to occupy the sites assigned to CO in the LEED model (4) so that this molecule can also be imaged. Images of disordered samples were difficult to interpret because of possible diffusion during the image acquisition. In subsequent measurements we studied Cu-phthalocyanine, which is of interest due to the catalytic activities of its central metal atom, on different substrates in order to better understand and exploit the consequences of variations in the molecule-surface interaction. In preliminary work, using submonolayer coverages on Si(111) or Au(111), we were not successful in obtaining good images which showed the 4-fold symmetry of this molecule. On Cu(100), however, atomic resolution images of this molecule were readily obtained for coverages up to 1 monolayer (5). At low coverages the molecules occupy two binding sites related by a mirror plane and show little tendency to form islands, although there may be some local orientational order. Molecules near step edges appeared to overlap the steps, with two lobes on the upper terrace and two lobes on the lower terrace. It was possible to adjust the operating conditions so that tip-molecule interactions appear to induce translational motion of the molecules. The lattice of the Cu(100) substrate was also observed but the molecules appear less stable, or simply absent, under conditions where the metal corrugation is large. Packed ordered arrays of molecules were observed near 1 monolayer coverage with domain structures in agreement with earlier LEED observations (6). When the coverage was increased slightly above 1 monolayer we found that we were unable to attain high resolution images of second layer molecules. At coverages slightly above 1 monolayer, we observed protrusions above a packed, ordered first layer, which appear diffuse and unstable. The diffuse character of the second layer molecule images strongly resembles that of images of sub-monolayers on Au(111) and Si(111). We suspect that the poor resolution results from inadequate binding of the molecules to the underlying layer. This does not imply that the molecules are too poorly conductive to be imaged, because the apparent height of second layer molecules is quite similar to that of first layer molecules. But they may be moved about by thermal effects or tip-molecule interactions. Although it is still in its infancy, these results suggest that STM will become increasingly important for studies of surface chemistry. Improvements in the apparatus aimed at increasing the image acquisition rate, allowing operation at different temperatures, and employing more elaborate sample and tip preparation techniques should extend the impact of this technique to a broader range of systems. A better understanding of the origin of the image contrast is certain to result both from empirical results and more quantitative theoretical analyses. Recent work will hopefully illustrate these points. It is our hope and expectation that STM images of reactive molecules will help to provide insight into the atomic scale details of surface mediated chemical processes."

On CTs of the abdomen and pelvis, skeletal muscle was segmented, and cross-sectional muscle area, muscle volume, and muscle attenuation were determined. Within the segmented muscle, intramuscular fat area, volume, and density were derived. On PET images, the standardized uptake value (SUV) of muscle was determined. Regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between the imaging measures and health outcomes including overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant cancer recurrence (DCR), and major surgical complications (MSC). The association between imaging metrics and pre-therapy levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, hemoglobin, and albumin was determined. Decreased volumetric muscle CT attenuation was associated with increased DCR. Increased PET SUV of muscle was associated with decreased OS and LRFS. Lower muscle SUV was associated with lower serum hemoglobin and albumin. Muscle measurements obtained on routine 18F-FDG PET/CT are associated with outcomes and serum hemoglobin and albumin in patients with sarcoma."

Mice were examined at 15 to 16 weeks postnatal age by performing anterior segment biomicroscopy, posterior segment examination by indirect ophthalmoscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, and optical coherence tomography of anterior and posterior segment structures.ResultsCommon ocular findings in the C57BL/6N strain included corneal deposits (3%), increased optical density of the anterior lens capsule (67%), punctate nuclear cataracts (98%), vitreous crystalline deposits (61%), hyaloid vascular remnant (6%), and retinal dysplasia attributed to the rd8 mutation (58%). Interestingly, retinal dysplasia was more common in male mice in all four breeding colonies evaluated in this study. The thickness of ocular tissues and compartments were measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, including the central cornea, anterior chamber, vitreous, and retinal layers. Intraocular pressure was measured by rebound tonometry.ConclusionsOcular abnormalities are common in anterior and posterior segments of the C57BL/6N mouse, the most common background on which single-gene knockout mice have been made. It is important that vision scientists understand the extent and variability of ocular findings associated with this particular genetic background of mice."

No effects of time or interactions between time and diagnosis were observed. Intraclass correlation coefficients also suggested AX-CPT performance was stable across time for all diagnostic groups. Although performance was stable on average, a positive association was noted between change in cognitive control and change in disorganization symptom severity across patient groups. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that deficits in cognitive control are present in both disorders and stable over the early course of psychotic illness.

Subjects performed the AX-CPT at 2 time points separated by an average of 365 days (range 270-620). Previously identified deficits in cognitive control were replicated in both patient groups. No effects of time or interactions between time and diagnosis were observed. Intraclass correlation coefficients also suggested AX-CPT performance was stable across time for all diagnostic groups. Although performance was stable on average, a positive association was noted between change in cognitive control and change in disorganization symptom severity across patient groups. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that deficits in cognitive control are present in both disorders and stable over the early course of psychotic illness. No evidence was observed for progression or deterioration of cognitive control or differential recovery in SZ compared to BD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)."
"SRINIVASAN, Vivek J","Highly parallel, interferometric diffusing wave spectroscopy for monitoring cerebral blood flow dynamics.","Light-scattering methods are widely used in soft matter physics and biomedical optics to probe dynamics in turbid media, such as diffusion in colloids or blood flow in biological tissue. These methods typically rely on fluctuations of coherent light intensity, and therefore cannot accommodate more than a few modes per detector. This limitation has hindered efforts to measure deep tissue blood flow with high speed, since weak diffuse light fluxes, together with low single-mode fiber throughput, result in low photon count rates. To solve this, we introduce multimode fiber (MMF) interferometry to the field of diffuse optics. In doing so, we transform a standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera into a sensitive detector array for weak light fluxes that probe deep in biological tissue. Specifically, we build a novel CMOS-based, multimode interferometric diffusing wave spectroscopy (iDWS) system and show that it can measure âˆ¼20 speckles simultaneously near the shot noise limit, acting essentially as âˆ¼20 independent photon-counting channels. We develop a matrix formalism, based on MMF mode field solutions and detector geometry, to predict both coherence and speckle number in iDWS. After validation in liquid phantoms, we demonstrate iDWS pulsatile blood flow measurements at 2.5 cm source-detector separation in the adult human brain in vivo. By achieving highly sensitive and parallel measurements of coherent light fluctuations with a CMOS camera, this work promises to enhance performance and reduce cost of diffuse optical instruments."

"TZIMENATOS, Leah S",Clinical Trial of Fluid Infusion Rates for Pediatric Diabetic Ketoacidosis,"BACKGROUND:Diabetic ketoacidosis in children may cause brain injuries ranging from mild to severe. Whether intravenous fluids contribute to these injuries has been debated for decades. METHODS:We conducted a 13-center, randomized, controlled trial that examined the effects of the rate of administration and the sodium chloride content of intravenous fluids on neurologic outcomes in children with diabetic ketoacidosis. Children were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups in a 2-by-2 factorial design (0.9% or 0.45% sodium chloride content and rapid or slow rate of administration). The primary outcome was a decline in mental status (two consecutive Glasgow Coma Scale scores of <14, on a scale ranging from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating worse mental status) during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis. Secondary outcomes included clinically apparent brain injury during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis, short-term memory during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis, and memory and IQ 2 to 6 months after recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis. RESULTS:A total of 1389 episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis were reported in 1255 children. The Glasgow Coma Scale score declined to less than 14 in 48 episodes (3.5%), and clinically apparent brain injury occurred in 12 episodes (0.9%). No significant differences among the treatment groups were observed with respect to the percentage of episodes in which the Glasgow Coma Scale score declined to below 14, the magnitude of decline in the Glasgow Coma Scale score, or the duration of time in which the Glasgow Coma Scale score was less than 14; with respect to the results of the tests of short-term memory; or with respect to the incidence of clinically apparent brain injury during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis. Memory and IQ scores obtained after the children's recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis also did not differ significantly among the groups. Serious adverse events other than altered mental status were rare and occurred with similar frequency in all treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS:Neither the rate of administration nor the sodium chloride content of intravenous fluids significantly influenced neurologic outcomes in children with diabetic ketoacidosis.

"SAGESHIMA, Junichiro",Combined Ex Vivo Hypothermic and Normothermic Perfusion for Assessment of High-risk Deceased Donor Human Kidneys for Transplantation.,"BackgroundDespite careful clinical examination, procurement biopsy and assessment on hypothermic machine perfusion, a significant number of potentially useable deceased donor kidneys will be discarded because they are deemed unsuitable for transplantation. Ex vivo normothermic perfusion (EVNP) may be useful as a means to further assess high-risk kidneys to determine suitability for transplantation.MethodsFrom June 2014 to October 2015, 7 kidneys (mean donor age, 54.3 years and Kidney Donor Profile Index, 79%) that were initially procured with the intention to transplant were discarded based on a combination of clinical findings, suboptimal biopsies, long cold ischemia time (CIT) and/or poor hypothermic perfusion parameters. They were subsequently placed on EVNP using oxygenated packed red blood cells and supplemental nutrition for a period of 3 hours. Continuous hemodynamic and functional parameters were assessed.ResultsAfter a mean CIT of 43.7 hours, all 7 kidneys appeared viable on EVNP with progressively increasing renal blood flow over the 3-hour period of perfusion. Five of the 7 kidneys had excellent macroscopic appearance, rapid increase in blood flow to 200 to 250 mL/min, urine output of 40 to 260 mL/h and increasing creatinine clearance.ConclusionsFavorable perfusion characteristics and immediate function after a 3-hour course of EVNP suggests that high-risk kidneys subjected to long CIT may have been considered for transplantation. The combined use of ex vivo hypothermic and normothermic perfusion may be a useful strategy to more adequately assess and preserve high-risk kidneys deemed unsuitable for transplantation. A clinical trial will be necessary to validate the usefulness of this approach."
"SAGESHIMA, Junichiro",Impact of Willingness to Accept Hepatitis C Seropositive Kidneys Among Hepatitis C RNA-Positive Waitlisted Patients.,"BackgroundKidney transplantation from hepatitis C seropositive (HCV+) donors may benefit hepatitis C RNA-positive (RNA+) candidates, but it is unclear how the willingness to be listed for and accept such kidneys affects waitlist and transplant outcomes.MethodsIn a single-center retrospective analysis, HCV+ transplant candidates (N = 169) listed from March 2004 to February 2015 were evaluated. All RNA+ candidates were offered the option to be listed for HCV+ donors. RNA- candidates were listed only for HCV- donors.ResultsFifty-seven patients (51% of all RNA+ transplant candidates) willing to accept HCV+ donors were listed for both HCV+ and HCV- donor kidneys. During 6-year follow up, 43 (75%) of 57 patients accepting HCV+ versus 19 (35%) of 55 patients not accepting HCV+ received a deceased donor kidney transplant (P < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that willingness to be listed for and accept HCV+ kidneys was associated with receiving deceased donor kidney transplant (P = 0.0016). Fewer patients accepting HCV+ donors (7 [12%] vs 16 [29%]) were removed from the list due to death or deteriorated medical condition (P = 0.0117). Posttransplant patient and graft survival rates were not significantly different. Overall patient survival since the listing (combined waitlist and posttransplant survival) was similar among the groups.ConclusionsHCV RNA+ candidates had better access to transplantation and similar overall survival before the era of widespread use of direct-acting anti-HCV agents."

"SHERMAN, Jeffrey",Automatic Antecedents of Discrimination,"In increasingly diverse societies, discrimination against social groups and their members continues to be a public and political concern. Research has addressed three basic cognitive processes that precede discrimination: categorization, stereotype/prejudice activation, and stereotype/prejudice application, suggesting that these processes occur in an automatic fashion. However, there are multiple components of automaticity, including unawareness, efficiency, unintentionality, and uncontrollability. Most of the previous research implies that these components of automaticity converge with respect to cognitive antecedents of discrimination. Here, we review evidence on the distinct components of automaticity in order to assess whether (a) categorization, (b) stereotype/prejudice activation, and (c) stereotype/prejudice application occur (1) without awareness, (2) efficiently, and (3) goal-independently. We highlight evidence indicating convergence or divergence of the automaticity components during each of the processing stages. This analysis provides readers with an up-to-date review that helps to evaluate whether a multi-component approach to automaticity is of additional benefit in aggregating knowledge about the cognitive antecedents of discrimination. We discuss open issues and avenues for future research."

We have found an unexplored mechanism, by which basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) induces expression of fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) to increase core fucosylations of N-linked glycans of membrane-associated proteins, including several integrin subunits. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments show that FUT8 is both necessary and sufficient to induce migration of MSCs. Silencing FUT8 also affects migration of MSCs in zebrafish embryos and a murine bone fracture model. Finally, we use in silico modeling to show that core fucosylations restrict the degrees of freedom of glycans on the integrin's surface, hence stabilizing glycans on a specific position. Altogether, we show a mechanism whereby FGF2 promotes migration of MSCs by modifying N-glycans. This work may help improve delivery of MSCs in therapeutic settings."

Meaning was captured by ""meaning maps"" representing the spatial distribution of semantic information in scenes. Meaning maps were coded in a format that could be directly compared to maps of image salience generated from image features. We investigated the degree to which meaning versus image salience predicted human viewers' spatiotemporal distribution of attention over scenes. Extending previous work, here the distribution of attention was operationalized as duration-weighted fixation density. The results showed that both meaning and image salience predicted the duration-weighted distribution of attention, but that when the correlation between meaning and salience was statistically controlled, meaning accounted for unique variance in attention whereas salience did not. This pattern was observed in early as well as late fixations, fixations including and excluding the centers of the scenes, and fixations following short as well as long saccades. The results strongly suggest that meaning guides attention in real-world scenes. We discuss the results from the perspective of a cognitive-relevance theory of attentional guidance."

These algorithms rely on a freely available property of starlight, namely its coherence over large scales, to sense directly atmospheric and instrumental phase errors across large distances.

The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has called for research on the optimal time to clamp the cord during cesarean deliveries (CD). Our objective was to conduct a pilot trial examining the safety of delayed cord clamping (DCC) for maternal-infant dyads during elective cesarean delivery (CD).MethodsWe enrolled 39 dyads [23 at 90&nbsp;s, 16 at 120&nbsp;s; (DCC Pilot)] between 10/2013 and 9/2014. We abstracted data from the electronic medical record (EMR) for historical controls (HC) birthing between 1/2012-6/2013 for whom DCC was not performed (nâ€‰=â€‰112).ResultsAvailable data for 37 mothers and 30 infants compared to HC revealed 174 (95% CI: 61-286) mL lower mean estimated maternal blood loss [(EBL) mean (SD) mL]: DCC Pilot 691(218) vs. HC 864(442), p&nbsp;=â€‰0.003 and lower incidence of maternal transfusions, DCC Pilot 2.7% vs. HC 18.8%, p&nbsp;=â€‰0.016.

"ERDEMBILEG, Anuurad",Effect of antiretroviral therapy on allele-associated Lp(a) level in women with HIV in the Women's Interagency HIV Study,"We previously demonstrated an association between lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels and atherosclerosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive women. The effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on Lp(a) levels in relation to apo(a) size polymorphism remain unclear. ART effects on allele-specific apo(a) level (ASL), an Lp(a) level associated with individual apo(a) alleles within each allele-pair, were determined in 126 HIV-seropositive women. ART effects were tested by a mixed-effects model across pre-ART and post-ART first and third visits. Data from 120 HIV-seronegative women were used. The mean age was 38 years; most were African-American (âˆ¼70%). Pre-ART ASLs associated with the larger (4.6 mg/dl vs. 8.0 mg/dl, P = 0.024) or smaller (13 mg/dl vs. 19 mg/dl, P = 0.041) apo(a) sizes were lower in the HIV-seropositive versus HIV-seronegative group, as was the prevalence of a high Lp(a) level (P = 0.013). Post-ART ASL and prevalence of high Lp(a) or apo(a) sizes and frequency of small size apo(a) (î€£22 kringles) did not differ between the two groups. ART increased Lp(a) level (from 18 to 24 mg/dl, P < 0.0001) and both ASLs (P < 0.001). In conclusion, regardless of genetic control, Lp(a) can be modulated by HIV and its treatment. ART initiation abrogates HIV-induced suppression of Lp(a) levels and ASLs, contributing to promote CVD risk in HIV-seropositive individuals."

"COOP, Graham M",Inferring Recent Demography from Isolation by Distance of Long Shared Sequence Blocks,"Recently it has become feasible to detect long blocks of nearly identical sequence shared between pairs of genomes. These identity-by-descent (IBD) blocks are direct traces of recent coalescence events and, as such, contain ample signal to infer recent demography. Here, we examine sharing of such blocks in two-dimensional populations with local migration. Using a diffusion approximation to trace genetic ancestry, we derive analytical formulas for patterns of isolation by distance of IBD blocks, which can also incorporate recent population density changes. We introduce an inference scheme that uses a composite-likelihood approach to fit these formulas. We then extensively evaluate our theory and inference method on a range of scenarios using simulated data. We first validate the diffusion approximation by showing that the theoretical results closely match the simulated block-sharing patterns. We then demonstrate that our inference scheme can accurately and robustly infer dispersal rate and effective density, as well as bounds on recent dynamics of population density. To demonstrate an application, we use our estimation scheme to explore the fit of a diffusion model to Eastern European samples in the Population Reference Sample data set. We show that ancestry diffusing with a rate of [Formula: see text] during the last centuries, combined with accelerating population growth, can explain the observed exponential decay of block sharing with increasing pairwise sample distance."
"COOP, Graham M",A Genomic Map of the Effects of Linked Selection in Drosophila,"Natural selection at one site shapes patterns of genetic variation at linked sites. Quantifying the effects of ""linked selection"" on levels of genetic diversity is key to making reliable inference about demography, building a null model in scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics of natural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that jointly infers parameters of distinct modes of linked selection, notably background selection and selective sweeps, from genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations and genetic maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a neutral site is polymorphic given local annotations, substitution patterns, and recombination rates. Information is then combined across sites and samples using composite likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of distinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter estimation, this approach yields a map of the expected neutral diversity levels along the genome. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing data from 125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict diversity levels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate estimates of a high fraction of beneficial substitutions in proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They allow us to distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes of selection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover evidence for pervasive sweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs). Our inference further suggests a substantial effect of other modes of linked selection and of adaptation in particular. More generally, we demonstrate that linked selection has had a larger effect in reducing diversity levels and increasing their variance in D. melanogaster than previously appreciated."

"SCHANK, Jeffrey C",Toward a Theory of the Evolution of Fair Play,"Juvenile animals of many species engage in social play, but its functional significance is not well understood. This is especially true for a type of social play called fair play (Fp). Social play often involves behavioral patterns similar to adult behaviors (e.g., fighting, mating, and predatory activities), but young animals often engage in Fp behaviors such as role-reversals and self-handicapping, which raises the evolutionary problem of why Fp exists. A long-held working hypothesis, tracing back to the 19th century, is that social play provides contexts in which adult social skills needed for adulthood can be learned or, at least, refined. On this hypothesis, Fp may have evolved for adults to acquire skills for behaving fairly in the sense of equitable distribution of resources or treatment of others. We investigated the evolution of Fp using an evolutionary agent-based model of populations of social agents that learn adult fair behavior (Fb) by engaging in Fp as juveniles. In our model, adults produce offspring by accumulating resources over time through foraging. Adults can either behave selfishly by keeping the resources they forage or they can pool them, subsequently dividing the pooled resources after each round of foraging. We found that fairness as equitability was beneficial especially when resources were large but difficult to obtain and led to the evolution of Fp. We conclude by discussing the implications of this model, for developing more rigorous theory on the evolution of social play, and future directions for theory development by modeling the evolution of play."
"SADRO, Steven",Effects of Climate Variability on Snowmelt and Implications for Organic Matter in a Highâ€Elevation Lake,"Few coupled lake-watershed studies examine long-term effects of climate on the ecosystem function of lakes in a hydrological context. We use 32 years of hydrological and biogeochemical data from a high-elevation site in the Sierra Nevada of California to characterize variation in snowmelt in relation to climate variability and explore the impact on factors affecting phytoplankton biomass. The magnitude of accumulated winter snow, quantified through basinwide estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE), was the most important climate factor controlling variation in the timing and rate of spring snowmelt. Variations in SWE and snowmelt led to significant differences in lake flushing rate, water temperature, and nitrate concentrations across years. On average in dry years, snowmelt started 25&nbsp;days earlier and proceeded 7&nbsp;mm/day slower, and the lake began the ice-free season with nitrate concentrations ~2&nbsp;Î¼M higher and water temperatures 9Â°C warmer than in wet years. Flushing rates in wet years were 2.5 times larger than those in dry years. Consequently, particulate organic matter concentrations, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, were 5â€“6&nbsp;Î¼M higher in dry years. There was a temporal trend of increase in particulate organic matter across dry years that corresponded to lake warming independent of variation in SWE. These results suggest that phytoplankton biomass is increasing as a result of both interannual variability in precipitation and long-term warming trends. Our study underscores the need to account for local-scale catchment variability that may affect the accumulation of winter snowpack when predicting climate responses in lakes."

"PAUL, Debashis",PCA in High Dimensions: An Orientation,"When the data are high dimensional, widely used multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analysis can behave in unexpected ways. In settings where the dimension of the observations is comparable to the sample size, upward bias in sample eigenvalues and inconsistency of sample eigenvectors are among the most notable phenomena that appear. These phenomena, and the limiting behavior of the rescaled extreme sample eigenvalues, have recently been investigated in detail under the spiked covariance model. The behavior of the bulk of the sample eigenvalues under weak distributional assumptions on the observations has been described. These results have been exploited to develop new estimation and hypothesis testing methods for the population covariance matrix. Furthermore, partly in response to these phenomena, alternative classes of estimation procedures have been developed by exploiting sparsity of the eigenvectors or the covariance matrix. This paper gives an orientation to these areas."
"FIEHN, Oliver",Salvage of the 5-deoxyribose byproduct of radical SAM enzymes,"5-Deoxyribose is formed from 5'-deoxyadenosine, a toxic byproduct of radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes. The degradative fate of 5-deoxyribose is unknown. Here, we define a salvage pathway for 5-deoxyribose in bacteria, consisting of phosphorylation, isomerization, and aldol cleavage steps. Analysis of bacterial genomes uncovers widespread, unassigned three-gene clusters specifying a putative kinase, isomerase, and sugar phosphate aldolase. We show that the enzymes encoded by the Bacillus thuringiensis cluster, acting together in vitro, convert 5-deoxyribose successively to 5-deoxyribose 1-phosphate, 5-deoxyribulose 1-phosphate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate plus acetaldehyde. Deleting the isomerase decreases the 5-deoxyribulose 1-phosphate pool size, and deleting either the isomerase or the aldolase increases susceptibility to 5-deoxyribose. The substrate preference of the aldolase is unique among family members, and the X-ray structure reveals an unusual manganese-dependent enzyme. This work defines a salvage pathway for 5-deoxyribose, a near-universal metabolite."

Efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and target engagement were determined.ResultsThe MTDs were 17.5 mg/m2 for LMP 776 and 100 mg/m2 for LMP744; bone marrow toxicity was dose-limiting; up to 65 mg/m2 LMP400 was well-tolerated and MTD was not reached. None of the drugs induced notable diarrhea. Sustained tumor accumulation was observed for LMP744; Î³H2AX induction was demonstrated in tumors 2 and 6 hours after treatment; a decrease in TOP1 protein was observed in most lymphoma samples across all compounds and dose levels, which is consistent with the fact that tumor response was also observed at low doses LMP744. Objective responses were documented for all indenoisoquinolines; efficacy (13/19 dogs) was greatest for LMP744.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate proof-of-mechanism for indenoisoquinoline TOP1 inhibitors supporting their further clinical development. They also highlight the value of the NCI Comparative Oncology Program (https://ccr.cancer.gov/Comparative-Oncology-Program) for evaluating novel therapies in immunocompetent pets with cancers."

"BRITT, R. David",Electronic Structure of Two Catalytic States of the [FeFe] Hydrogenase Hâ€‘Cluster As Probed by Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,"The active site of the [FeFe] hydrogenase (HydA1), the H-cluster, is a 6-Fe cofactor that contains CO and CN- ligands. It undergoes several different oxidation and protonation state changes in its catalytic cycle to metabolize H2. Among them, the well-known Hox state and the recently identified Hhyd state are thought to be directly involved in H2 activation and evolution, and they are both EPR active with net spin S = 1/2. Herein, we report the pulse electronic paramagnetic spectroscopic investigation of these two catalytic states in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii HydA1 ( CrHydA1). Using an in vitro biosynthetic maturation approach, we site-specifically installed 13C into the CO or CN- ligands and 57Fe into the [2Fe]H subcluster of the H-cluster in order to measure the hyperfine couplings to these magnetic nuclei. For Hox, we measured 13C hyperfine couplings (13CO aiso of 25.5, 5.8, and 4.5 MHz) corresponding to all three CO ligands in the H-cluster. We also observed two 57Fe hyperfine couplings (57Fe aiso of âˆ¼17 and 5.7 MHz) arising from the two Fe atoms in the [2Fe]H subcluster. For Hhyd, we only observed two distinct 13CO hyperfine interactions (13CO aiso of 0.16 and 0.08 MHz) and only one for 13CN- (13CN aiso of 0.16 MHz); the couplings to the 13CO/13CN- on the distal Fe of [2Fe]H may be too small to detect. We also observed a very small (<0.3 MHz) 57Fe HFI from the labeled [2Fe]H subcluster and four 57Fe HFI from the labeled [4Fe-4S]H subcluster (57Fe aiso of 7.2, 16.6, 28.2, and 35.3 MHz). These hyperfine coupling constants are consistent with the previously proposed electronic structure of the H-cluster at both Hox and Hhyd states and provide a basis for more detailed analysis."

Being physical objects that can be re-studied by other researchers, types permanently link taxonomy (an artificial agreement to classify biological diversity) with nomenclature (an artificial agreement to name biological diversity). Two proposals to amend the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), allowing DNA sequences alone (of any region and extent) to serve as types of taxon names for voucherless fungi (mainly putative taxa from environmental DNA sequences), have been submitted to be voted on at the 11th International Mycological Congress (Puerto Rico, July 2018). We consider various genetic processes affecting the distribution of alleles among taxa and find that alleles may not consistently and uniquely represent the species within which they are contained. Should the proposals be accepted, the meaning of nomenclatural types would change in a fundamental way from physical objects as sources of data to the data themselves. Such changes are conducive to irreproducible science, the potential typification on artefactual data, and massive creation of names with low information content, ultimately causing nomenclatural instability and unnecessary work for future researchers that would stall future explorations of fungal diversity. We conclude that the acceptance of DNA sequences alone as types of names of taxa, under the terms used in the current proposals, is unnecessary and would not solve the problem of naming putative taxa known only from DNA sequences in a scientifically defensible way. As an alternative, we highlight the use of formulas for naming putative taxa (candidate taxa) that do not require any modification of the ICN."

CfAvr4, an effector protein from the tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum and the founding member of a fungal effector family, promotes parasitism through binding fungal chitin and protecting it from chitinases. Binding of Avr4 to chitin is mediated by a carbohydrate-binding module of family 14 (CBM14), an abundant CBM across all domains of life. To date, the structural basis of chitin-binding by Avr4 effector proteins and of recognition by the cognate Cf-4 plant immune receptor are still poorly understood. Using X-ray crystallography, we solved the crystal structure of CfAvr4 in complex with chitohexaose [(GlcNAc)6] at 1.95Ã… resolution. This is the first co-crystal structure of a CBM14 protein together with its ligand that further reveals the molecular mechanism of (GlcNAc)6 binding by Avr4 effector proteins and CBM14 family members in general. The structure showed that two molecules of CfAvr4 interact through the ligand and form a three-dimensional molecular sandwich that encapsulates two (GlcNAc)6 molecules within the dimeric assembly. Contrary to previous assumptions made with other CBM14 members, the chitohexaose-binding domain (ChBD) extends to the entire length of CfAvr4 with the reducing end of (GlcNAc)6 positioned near the N-terminus and the non-reducing end at the C-terminus. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues interacting with (GlcNAc)6 enabled the elucidation of the precise topography and amino acid composition of Avr4's ChBD and further showed that these residues do not individually mediate the recognition of CfAvr4 by the Cf-4 immune receptor. Instead, the studies highlighted the dependency of Cf-4-mediated recognition on CfAvr4's stability and resistance against proteolysis in the leaf apoplast, and provided the evidence for structurally separating intrinsic function from immune receptor recognition in this effector family."
"KATZMAN, Scott A",Lipid peroxidation biomarkers for evaluating oxidative stress in equine neuroaxonal dystrophy,"BackgroundEquine neuroaxonal dystrophy/equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy (eNAD/EDM) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting genetically predisposed foals maintained on an Î±-tocopherol (Î±-TOH) deficient diet. Currently no antemortem diagnostic test for eNAD/EDM is available.HypothesisBecause Î±-TOH deficiency is associated with increased lipid peroxidation, it was hypothesized that F2 -isoprostanes (F2 IsoP), F4 -neuroprostanes (F4 NP) and oxysterols derived from free radical oxidation would be increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neural tissue of eNAD/EDM affected horses and could serve as potential biomarkers for disease.AnimalsIsoprostane Study A: 14 Quarter horse foals (10 healthy foals and 4 eNAD/EDM affected foals) at 1 and 6 months of age. Isoprostane Study B: 17 eNAD/EDM affected and 10 unaffected horsesâ€‰â‰¥â€‰1-4 years of age. Oxysterol study: eNAD/EDM affected (nâ€‰=â€‰14, serum; nâ€‰=â€‰11, CSF; nâ€‰=â€‰10, spinal cord [SC]) and unaffected horses 1-4 years of age (nâ€‰=â€‰12, serum; nâ€‰=â€‰10, CSF; nâ€‰=â€‰7, SC).ProceduresCerebrospinal fluid [F2 IsoP] and [F4 NP] were assessed using gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Serum, CSF, and cervical SC [oxysterols] were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results were compared with respective Î±-TOH concentrations.ResultsSpinal cord [7-ketocholesterol], [7-hydroxycholesterol], and [7-keto-27-hydrocholesterol] were higher in eNAD/EDM horses whereas [24-ketocholesterol] was lower. No significant difference was found in CSF [F2 IsoP] and [F4 NP], serum [oxysterols] and CSF [oxysterols] between eNAD/EDM affected and unaffected horses. No correlation was found between [F2 IsoP], [F4 NP], or [oxysterols] and respective [Î±-TOH].Conclusions and clinical importanceIn the SC, targeted markers of cholesterol oxidation were significantly increased in horses with eNAD/EDM."
"LOOTS, Gabriela G",Vhl deficiency in osteocytes produces high bone mass and hematopoietic defects.,"Tissue oxygen (O2) levels vary during development and disease; adaptations to decreased O2 (hypoxia) are mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors. HIFs are active in the skeleton, and stabilizing HIF-Î± isoforms cause high bone mass (HBM) phenotypes. A fundamental limitation of previous studies examining the obligate role for HIF-Î± isoforms in the skeleton involves the persistence of gene deletion as osteolineage cells differentiate into osteocytes. Because osteocytes orchestrate skeletal development and homeostasis, we evaluated the influence of Vhl or Hif1a disruption in osteocytes. Osteocytic Vhl deletion caused HBM phenotype, but Hif1a was dispensable in osteocytes. Vhl cKO mice revealed enhanced canonical Wnt signaling. B cell development was reduced while myelopoiesis increased in osteocytic Vhl cKO, revealing a novel influence of Vhl/HIF-Î± function in osteocytes on maintenance of bone microarchitecture via canonical Wnt signaling and effects on hematopoiesis."
"BROWN, Patrick James J",Genetic Introgression from Glycine tomentella to Soybean to Increase Seed Yield,"Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] breeding in the United States currently relies on a narrow genetic base. Glycine tomentella Hayata (2n = 78), native to Australia, is a perennial relative in the tertiary gene pool of soybean. No effort has been devoted to using this species to increase seed yield. The objectives of this research were (i) to identify high-yielding lines derived from backcrosses between the soybean cultivar Dwight (2n = 40) and G. tomentella PI 441001 (2n = 78) and to compare their agronomic performance with that of the recurrent parent, and (ii) to determine associations between G. tomentella introgressions and agronomic traits. PI 441001 was crossed to Dwight and immature seed rescue was used to produce a sterile F1 plant. Amphidiploid plants (2n = 118) were produced by treating the F1 hybrid with colchicine. Amphidiploid plants were backcrossed to Dwight and a series of backcrosses were made to obtain lines with 2n = 40 chromosomes, which were self-fertile and genetically stable. Preliminary yield testing was used to select 180 lines in maturity groups II, III, and IV that had yields greater than or less than that of the recurrent parent. Yield data collected in two replication tests at six to eight locations in 2013 and 2014 identified experimental lines in all three maturity groups that were higher yielding than the recurrent parent. All experimental and parental lines were genotyped, revealing an average of 1% G. tomentella introgression. Significant associations were detected between G. tomentella introgressions and time of flowering, height, lodging, and yield."
"KIM, Kee D","Anterior and Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion With Supplemental Interspinous Process Fixation: Outcomes from a Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Study.","BackgroundRigid interspinous process fixation (ISPF) has received consideration as an efficient, minimally disruptive technique in supporting lumbar interbody fusion. However, despite advantageous intraoperative utility, limited evidence exists characterizing midterm to long-term clinical outcomes with ISPF. The objective of this multicenter study was to prospectively assess patients receiving single-level anterior (ALIF) or lateral (LLIF) lumbar interbody fusion with adjunctive ISPF.MethodsThis was a prospective, randomized, multicenter (11 investigators), noninferiority trial. All patients received single-level ALIF or LLIF with supplemental ISPF (nâ€‰=â€‰66) or pedicle screw fixation (PSF; nâ€‰=â€‰37) for degenerative disc disease and/or spondylolisthesis (grade â‰¤2). The randomization patient ratio was 2:1, ISPF/PSF. Perioperative and follow-up outcomes were collected (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months).ResultsFor ISPF patients, mean posterior intraoperative outcomes were: blood loss, 70.9 mL; operating time, 52.2 minutes; incision length, 5.5 cm; and fluoroscopic imaging time, 10.4 seconds. Statistically significant improvement in patient Oswestry Disability Index scores were achieved by just 6 weeks after operation (Pâ€‰<â€‰.01) and improved out to 12 months for the ISPF cohort. Patient-reported 36-Item Short Form Health Survey and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire scores were also significantly improved from baseline to 12 months in the ISPF cohort (Pâ€‰<â€‰.01). A total of 92.7% of ISPF patients exhibited interspinous fusion at 12 months. One ISPF patient (1.5%) required a secondary surgical intervention of possible relation to the posterior instrumentation/procedure.ConclusionISPF can be achieved quickly, with minimal tissue disruption and complication. In supplementing ALIF and LLIF, ISPF supported significant improvement in early postoperative (â‰¤12 months) patient-reported outcomes, while facilitating robust posterior fusion."
"THORNE, James H",Climate risk on two vegetation axesâ€”Tropical wetâ€toâ€dry and temperate aridâ€toâ€moist forests,"AIM: Assess climatic risk to vegetation types associated with tropical and temperate ecosystems based on exposure analysis, which models future risk as a function of deviation from current climate variable distributions. LOCATION: Oaxaca State, Mexico. TAXON: Broadly defined vegetation types used in stateâ€ and nationalâ€level vegetation classification systems. These types can be grouped into series representing dryâ€toâ€wet conditions for tropical and temperate vegetation. METHODS: We used climate exposure analysis to compare current and future climate parameters for the major vegetation types of Oaxaca. This technique integrates a recent vegetation map with historical climate data (1981â€“2010) to produce a baseline climate layer that is compared to climate projections made with five different global circulation models for nearâ€future (2015â€“2039) and endâ€century (2075â€“2099) periods using two emissions scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). We classified the frequency distribution of the baseline climate into five exposure classes where the closer values are to mean climate conditions, the lower the exposure. Future exposure was estimated by classifying the vegetation pixels into the same exposure classes, now based on future climate values. Increased exposure risk was assessed based on the fraction of pixels that moved into higher exposure classes from one period to another. RESULTS AND MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed four general trends: (a) the higher, current track emissions scenario produced much larger endâ€century climate exposure; (b) for the tropical vegetation series, tropical evergreen forests are projected as most exposed by endâ€century; (c) for the temperate vegetation series the matorralâ€shrubland and conifer forests are the most impacted; and (d) the five GCMs considered showed some convergence in their endâ€century climate exposure predictions, with coastal and lowâ€elevation areas of the State projected to experience the greatest exposure, and the interior mountain slopes and central region projected to experience the least exposure and be the most climatically stable."

Initiatives have focused on increasing accrual, but changes at the population-level are unknown. We examined patterns of clinical trial participation over time in AYA patients with cancer. PROCEDURE: We utilized medical record data from AYAs in two population-based National Cancer Institute Patterns of Care Studies identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. Among 3135 AYAs diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and sarcoma, we used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate patient and provider characteristics associated with clinical trial enrollment. Interaction terms evaluated variation in clinical trial enrollment across patient and provider characteristics by year of diagnosis. RESULTS: From 2006 to 2012-2013, clinical trial participation increased from 14.8% to 17.9% (P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.01). Adjusting for patient and provider characteristics, we found lower clinical trial enrollment among those who were older at diagnosis, diagnosed with NHL vs ALL, treated by adult hematologist/oncologists only (vs pediatric hematologist/oncologists), and of non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic White) (P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.05 for all). Interaction analyses indicate improved clinical trial enrollment from 2006 to 2012-2013 among young adults 25-29 years of age and the uninsured. CONCLUSIONS: Although disparities in enrollment onto clinical trials remain for AYAs with cancer, our study identified increasing overall clinical trial participation over time.&nbsp;Further, we identify promising trends in enrollment uptake among AYAs 25-29 years of age and the uninsured."
"GIULIVI, Cecilia R",Allopregnanolone Treatment Improves Plasma Metabolomic Profile Associated with GABA Metabolism in Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome: a Pilot Study.,"Currently, there is no effective treatment for the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder. In this pilot study, we evaluated whether allopregnanolone, a natural neurosteroid that exerts beneficial effects in neurodegenerative diseases, nervous system injury, and peripheral neuropathies, could improve lymphocytic bioenergetics and plasma pharmacometabolomics in six males with FXTAS (68â€‰Â±â€‰3&nbsp;years old; FMR1 CGG repeats 94â€‰Â±â€‰4; FXTAS stages ranging from 3 to 5) enrolled in a 12-week open-label intervention study conducted at the University of California Davis from December 2015 through July 2016. Plasma pharmacometabolomics and lymphocytic mitochondria function were assessed at baseline (on the day of the first infusion) and at follow-up (within 48&nbsp;h&nbsp;from the last infusion). In parallel, quantitative measurements of tremor and ataxia and neuropsychological evaluations of mental state, executive function, learning, memory, and psychological symptoms were assessed at the same time points. Allopregnanolone treatment impacted significantly GABA metabolism, oxidative stress, and some of the mitochondria-related outcomes. Notably, the magnitude of the individual metabolic response, as well as the correlation with some of the behavioral tests, was overwhelmingly carrier-specific. Based on this pilot study, allopregnanolone treatment has the potential for improving cognitive and GABA metabolism in FXTAS aligned with the concept of precision medicine."
"ROSE, Lesilee S",The kinases PIG-1 and PAR-1 act in redundant pathways to regulate asymmetric division in the EMS blastomere of C. elegans,"The PAR-1 kinase of C. elegans is localized to the posterior of the one-cell embryo and its mutations affect asymmetric spindle placement and partitioning of cytoplasmic components in the first cell cycle. However, par-1 mutations do not cause failure to restrict the anterior PAR polarity complex to the same extent as mutations in the posteriorly localized PAR-2 protein. Further, it has been difficult to examine the role of PAR-1 in subsequent divisions due to the early defects in par-1 mutant embryos. Here we show that the PIG-1 kinase acts redundantly with PAR-1 to restrict the anterior PAR-3 protein for normal polarity in the one-cell embryo. By using a temperature sensitive allele of par-1, which exhibits enhanced lethality when combined with a pig-1 mutation, we have further explored roles for these genes in subsequent divisions. We find that both PIG-1 and PAR-1 regulate spindle orientation in the EMS blastomere of the four-cell stage embryo to ensure that it undergoes an asymmetric division. In this cell, PIG-1 and PAR-1 act in parallel pathways for spindle positioning, PIG-1 in the MES-1/SRC-1 pathway and PAR-1 in the Wnt pathway."
"STAVISKY, Sergey",Inferring single-trial neural population dynamics using sequential auto-encoders,"Neuroscience is experiencing a revolution in which simultaneous recording of thousands of neurons is revealing population dynamics that are not apparent from single-neuron responses. This structure is typically extracted from data averaged across many trials, but deeper understanding requires studying phenomena detected in single trials, which is challenging due to incomplete sampling of the neural population, trial-to-trial variability, and fluctuations in action potential timing. We introduce latent factor analysis via dynamical systems, a deep learning method to infer latent dynamics from single-trial neural spiking data. When applied to a variety of macaque and human motor cortical datasets, latent factor analysis via dynamical systems accurately predicts observed behavioral variables, extracts precise firing rate estimates of neural dynamics on single trials, infers perturbations to those dynamics that correlate with behavioral choices, and combines data from non-overlapping recording sessions spanning months to improve inference of underlying dynamics."
"LEIN, Pamela J","3,3Ê¹-Dichlorobiphenyl (PCB 11) promotes dendritic arborization in primary rat cortical neurons via a CREB-dependent mechanism","PCB 11 (3,3'-dichlorobiphenyl), a contemporary congener produced as a byproduct of current pigment production processes, has recently emerged as a prevalent worldwide pollutant. We recently demonstrated that exposure to PCB 11 increases dendritic arborization in vitro, but the mechanism(s) mediating this effect remain unknown. To address this data gap, primary cortical neuron-glia co-cultures derived from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed for 48&nbsp;h to either vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or PCB 11&nbsp;at concentrations ranging from 1 fM to 1&nbsp;nM in the absence or presence of pharmacologic antagonists of established molecular targets of higher chlorinated PCBs. Reporter cell lines were used to test activity of PCB 11&nbsp;at the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and thyroid hormone receptor (THR). PCB 11 lacked activity at the AhR and THR, and antagonism of these receptors had no effect on the dendrite-promoting activity of PCB 11. Pharmacologic antagonism of various calcium channels or treatment with antioxidants also did not alter PCB 11-induced dendritic arborization. In contrast, pharmacologic blockade or shRNA knockdown of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) significantly decreased dendritic growth in PCB 11-exposed cultures, suggesting PCB 11 promotes dendritic growth via CREB-mediated mechanisms. Since CREB signaling is crucial for normal neurodevelopment, and perturbations of CREB signaling have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, our findings suggest that this contemporary pollutant poses a threat to the developing brain, particularly in individuals with heritable mutations that promote CREB signaling."
"BELAFSKY, Peter C",Decreased intramuscular calcium hydroxyapatite implant resorption in a murine model of osteoporosis,"ObjectiveCalcium hydroxyapatite (CaHA) is a common material for vocal fold injection augmentation. Durability is variable, and factors involved in implant longevity are not understood. Animal models of osteoporosis show decreased bone density and increased mineral liberation, suggesting CaHA retention may be altered in these conditions.Study designProspective murine investigation.MethodsFourteen skeletally mature, 10-month-old female Sprague-Dewley rats were treated by one of three interventions: oophorectomy, laparotomy without oophorectomy (sham), or monthly risedronate injection (90â€‰Î¼g/kg, subcutaneous). CaHA was implanted into the right lateral thigh muscle in all animals at the time of procedure or first risedronate injection. After 17 weeks, all rats were sacrificed, and the residual CaHA isolated from excised lateral thigh muscle through incubation in a 900 Â°C calcinator for 9 hours.ResultsMean CaHA mass remaining in the oophorectomy group was 65.9 (standard deviationâ€‰Â±â€‰16.1) mg, compared to 44.4â€‰Â±â€‰10.0â€‰mg CaHA in the risedronate group and 48.6â€‰Â±â€‰7.5â€‰mg in the sham group. One-way analysis of variance found a statistically significant difference between the oophorectomy and risedronate groups but not between the sham and other groups, F(2,11)â€‰=â€‰4.404, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.039.ConclusionPersistent estrogen deficiency in a murine model of osteoporosis demonstrated decreased rate of CaHA resorption. This suggests that hormone alterations associated with osteoporosis may alter the longevity of CaHA implant resorption through an uncertain mechanism.Level of evidenceNA.

"ALFONSO GARCIA, Alba",Label-free assessment of carotid artery biochemical composition using fiber-based fluorescence lifetime imaging,"Novel diagnostic tools with the ability to monitor variations in biochemical composition and provide benchmark indicators of vascular tissue maturation are needed to create functional tissue replacements. We investigated the ability of fiber-based, label-free multispectral fluorescent lifetime imaging (FLIm) to quantify the anatomical variations in biochemical composition of native carotid arteries and validated these results against biochemical assays. FLIm-derived parameters in spectral band 415-455 nm correlated with tissue collagen content (R2 = 0.64) and cell number (R2 = 0.61) and in spectral band 465-553 nm strongly correlated with elastin content (R2 = 0.89). These results suggest that FLIm holds great potential for assessing vascular tissue maturation and functional properties based on tissue autofluorescence."

Automated algorithm-based DMS dispersion plot data analysis method was applied for the first time to pre-process and separate 3-dimentional (3-D) DMS dispersion data. We previously demonstrated our AnalyzeIMS (AIMS) software was capable of analyzing complex gas chromatography differential mobility spectrometry (GC-DMS) data sets. In our present work, the AIMS software was able to easliy separate DMS dispersion data sets of five chemicals that are important in detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs): 2-butanone, 2-propanone, ethyl acetate, methanol and ethanol. Identification of chemicals from mixtures, separation of chemicals from a mixture and prediction capability of the software were all tested. These automated algorithms may have potential applications in separation of chemicals (or ion peaks) from other 3-D data obtained by hybrid analytical devices such as mass spectrometry (MS). New algorithm developments are included as future considerations to improve the current numerical approaches to fingerprint chemicals (ions) from a significantly complicated dispersion plot. Comprehensive peak identifcation by DMS-MS, variations of the DMS data due to chemical concentration, gas phase ion chemistry, temperature and pressure of the drift gas are considered in future algorithm improvements."

"ANGKUSTSIRI, Kathleen",Extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid in high-risk and normal-risk children with autism aged 2â€“4 years: a case-control study,"BackgroundWe previously showed, in two separate cohorts, that high-risk infants who were later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder had abnormally high extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume from age 6-24 months. The presence of increased extra-axial CSF volume preceded the onset of behavioural symptoms of autism and was predictive of a later diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. In this study, we aimed to establish whether increased extra-axial CSF volume is found in a large, independent sample of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, whether extra-axial CSF remains abnormally increased beyond infancy, and whether it is present in both normal-risk and high-risk children with autism.MethodsIn this case-control MRI study, children with autism spectrum disorder or with typical development aged 2-4 years were recruited from the community to the UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project, based in Sacramento, CA, USA. The autism spectrum disorder group comprised children with autism spectrum disorder who were either normal risk (ie, from simplex families) or high risk (ie, from multiplex families). Measurements of extra-axial CSF volume, brain volume, head circumference, sleep problems, and familial risk status were derived from MRI and behavioural assessments. We applied a previously validated machine learning algorithm based on extra-axial CSF volume, brain volume, age, and sex to the current dataset.FindingsBetween July 20, 2007, and Dec 13, 2012, 159 children with autism spectrum disorder (132 male, 27 female) and 77 with typical development (49 male, 28 female) underwent MRI scans. The autism spectrum disorder group had an average of 15Â·1% more extra-axial CSF than controls after accounting for differences in brain volume, weight, age, and sex (least-squares mean 116Â·74 cm3 [SE 3Â·33] in autism group vs 101Â·40 cm3 [3Â·93] in typical development group; p=0Â·007; Cohen's d = 0Â·39). Subgroups of normal-risk (n=132) and high-risk (n=27) children with autism spectrum disorder had nearly identical extra-axial CSF volumes (p=0Â·78), and both subgroups had significantly greater volumes than controls. Both extra-axial CSF volume (p=0Â·004) and brain volume (p<0Â·0001) uniquely contributed to enlarged head circumference in the autism spectrum disorder group (p=0Â·04). Increased extra-axial CSF volume was associated with greater sleep disturbances (p=0Â·03) and lower non-verbal ability (p=0Â·04). The machine learning algorithm correctly predicted autism spectrum disorder diagnosis with a positive predictive value of 83% (95% CI 76Â·2-88Â·3).InterpretationIncreased extra-axial CSF volume is a reliable brain anomaly that has now been found in three independent cohorts, comprising both high-risk and normal-risk children with autism spectrum disorder. Increased extra-axial CSF volume is detectable using conventional structural MRI scans from infancy through to age 3 years. These results suggest that increased extra-axial CSF volume could be an early stratification biomarker of a biologically based subtype of autism that might share a common underlying pathophysiology.FundingUS National Institutes of Health."
"VAN DER MEULEN, Talitha",Evidence for a Neogenic Niche at the Periphery of Pancreatic Islets,"We recently discovered a novel subset of beta cells that resemble immature beta cells during pancreas development. We named these ""virgin"" beta cells as they do not stem from existing mature beta cells. Virgin beta cells are found exclusively at the islet periphery in areas that we therefore designated as the ""neogenic niche."" As beta cells are our only source of insulin, their loss leads to diabetes. Islets also contain glucagon-producing alpha cells and somatostatin-producing delta cells, that are important for glucose homeostasis and form a mantle surrounding the beta cell core. This 3D architecture is important and determines access to blood flow and innervation. We propose that the distinctive islet architecture may also play an important, but hitherto unappreciated role in generation of new endocrine cells, including beta cells. We discuss several predictions to further test the contribution of the neogenic niche to beta cell regeneration."

Experts predict that vehicles could be fully automated by as early as 2025 or as late as 2035. Methods are needed to help the public and private sector understand automated vehicle technologies and their system-level effects. First, we explore the effects of automated vehicles using the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commissionâ€™s activity-based travel demand model (MTC-ABM). The simulation is unique in that it articulates the size and direction of change on travel for a wide range of automated vehicles scenarios. Second, we simulate the effects of the introduction of an automated taxi service on conventional personal vehicle and transit travel in the San Francisco Bay Area region and use new research on the costs of automated vehicles to represent plausible per mile automated taxi fares. We use an integrated model for the San Francisco Bay Area that includes the MTC-ABM combined with the agent-based MATSim model customized for the region. This model set uses baseline travel demand data from the regionâ€™s official activity-based travel model and dynamically assigns vehicles on road and transit networks by the time of day. Third, we use the MTC-ABM and the MATSim dynamic assignment model to simulate different â€œfirstâ€ mile transit access services, including ride-hailing (Uber and Lyft) and ridesharing (Uber Pool/Lyft Line and Via) with and without automated vehicles. The results provide insight into the relative benefits of each service and automated vehicle technology and the potential market for these services.<a href=""https://ncst.ucdavis.edu/project/automated-vehicle-scenarios-simulation-system-level-travel-effects/"">View the NCST Project Webpage"
"BRANDT, James D",Na-K-Cl cotransport regulates intracellular volume and monolayer permeability of trabecular meshwork cells,"The trabecular meshwork (TM) of the eye plays a critical role in modulating intraocular pressure (IOP) through regulation of aqueous humor outflow, although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Ethacrynic acid, an agent known to inhibit Na-K-Cl cotransport of a number of cell types, recently has been reported to increase aqueous outflow and lower IOP through an unknown effect on the TM. In vascular endothelial cells and a variety of ether cell types, the Na-K-Cl cotransporter functions to regulate intracellular volume. The present study was conducted to evaluate TM cells for the presence of Na-K-Cl cotransport activity and to test the hypothesis that modulation of cotransport activity alters intracellular volume and, consequently, permeability of the TM. We demonstrate here that bovine and human TM cells exhibit robust Na-K-Cl cotransport activity that is inhibited by bumetanide and by ethacrynic acid. Our studies also show that TM cell Na- K-Cl cotransport is modulated by a variety of hormones and neurotransmitters. Inhibition of the cotransporter either by bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, or inhibitory hormones reduces TM intracellular volume, whereas stimulatory hormones increase cell volume. In addition, shrinkage of the cells by hypertonic media stimulates cotransport activity and initiates a subsequent regulatory volume increase. Permeability of TM cell monolayers, assessed as transmonolayer flux of [14C]sucrose, is increased by hypertonicity-induced cell shrinkage and by bumetanide. These findings suggest that Na-K-Cl cotransport of TM cells is of central importance to regulation of intracellular volume and TM permeability. Defects of Na-K-Cl cotransport may underlie the pathophysiology of glaucoma."

Three internally consistent socioeconomic scenarios are used to value health benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation policies specifically derived from slowing climate change. Our projections suggest that climate change, exclusive of changes in air pollutant emissions, can significantly impact ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution across the U.S. and increase associated health effects. Climate policy can substantially reduce these impacts, and climate-related air pollution health benefits alone can offset a significant fraction of mitigation costs. We find that in contrast to cobenefits from reductions to coemitted pollutants, the climate-induced air quality benefits of policy increase with time and are largest between 2050 and 2100. Our projections also suggest that increasing climate policy stringency beyond a certain degree may lead to diminishing returns relative to its cost. However, our results indicate that the air quality impacts of climate change are substantial and should be considered by cost-benefit climate policy analyses."
"SMITH, Lucas R",Nuclear rupture at sites of high curvature compromises retention of DNA repair factors,"The nucleus is physically linked to the cytoskeleton, adhesions, and extracellular matrix-all of which sustain forces, but their relationships to DNA damage are obscure. We show that nuclear rupture with cytoplasmic mislocalization of multiple DNA repair factors correlates with high nuclear curvature imposed by an external probe or by cell attachment to either aligned collagen fibers or stiff matrix. Mislocalization is greatly enhanced by lamin A depletion, requires hours for nuclear reentry, and correlates with an increase in pan-nucleoplasmic foci of the DNA damage marker Î³H2AX. Excess DNA damage is rescued in ruptured nuclei by cooverexpression of multiple DNA repair factors as well as by soft matrix or inhibition of actomyosin tension. Increased contractility has the opposite effect, and stiff tumors with low lamin A indeed exhibit increased nuclear curvature, more frequent nuclear rupture, and excess DNA damage. Additional stresses likely play a role, but the data suggest high curvature promotes nuclear rupture, which compromises retention of DNA repair factors and favors sustained damage."
"SMITH, Lucas R","SIRPA-Inhibited, Marrow-Derived Macrophages Engorge, Accumulate, and Differentiate in Antibody-Targeted Regression of Solid Tumors","Marrow-derived macrophages are highly phagocytic, but whether they can also traffic into solid tumors and engulf cancer cells is questionable, given the well-known limitations of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Here, SIRPÎ± on macrophages from mouse and human marrow was inhibited to block recognition of its ligand, the ""marker of self"" CD47 on all other cells. These macrophages were then systemically injected into mice with fluorescent human tumors that had been antibody targeted. Within days, the tumors regressed, and single-cell fluorescence analyses showed that the more the macrophages engulfed, the more they accumulated within regressing tumors. Human-marrow-derived macrophages engorged on the human tumors, while TAMs were minimally phagocytic, even toward CD47-knockdown tumors. Past studies had opsonized tumors in&nbsp;situ with antibody and/or relied on&nbsp;mouse TAMs but had not injected SIRPÎ±-inhibited cells; also, unlike past injections of anti-CD47, blood parameters remained normal and safe. Consistent with&nbsp;tumor-selective engorge-and-accumulate processes in&nbsp;vivo, phagocytosis in&nbsp;vitro inhibited macrophage migration through micropores that mimic features of dense 3D tissue. Accumulation of SIRPÎ±-inhibited macrophages in tumors favored tumor regression for 1-2&nbsp;weeks, but donor macrophages quickly differentiated toward non-phagocytic, high-SIRPÎ± TAMs. Analyses of macrophages on soft (like marrow) or stiff (like solid tumors) collagenous gels demonstrated a stiffness-driven, retinoic-acid-modulated upregulation of SIRPÎ± and the mechanosensitive nuclear marker lamin-A. Mechanosensitive differentiation was similarly evident in&nbsp;vivo and likely limited the anti-tumor effects, as confirmed by re-initiation of tumor regression by fresh injections of SIRPÎ±-inhibited macrophages. Macrophage motility, phagocytosis, and differentiation in&nbsp;vivo are thus coupled."

"KELLY, Maggi","Remotely Sensed Data Characterization, Classification, and Accuracies","Remote sensing, what it is and what it can be used for, is laid out in various chapters of this comprehensive book. We may only state here that remote sensing has a short history-when compared to traditional disciplines such as mathematics or physics. Contrarily, we may state that it has a long history when we compare it to recent Internet-based technology like social media or, closer to our field, the tracking of people and moving objects by means of cell phone signals. Remote sensing has been a domain for specialists for many years and to some degree it still is. Similarly, geographic information system (GIS) has for years been a field where professionals worked on designated workstations while not being fully integrated in standard corporate information technology infrastructures. The latter changed more than a decade ago, while for remote sensing only recently, one may still witness remnants of historical developments of Remote Sensing (RS)-specific hardware and software. The dominant concept in remote sensing has been the pixel, while GIS functionality has always been somehow splintered into the raster and vector domains. Blaschke and Strobl (2001) provocatively raised the question â€œWhat's wrong with pixels?â€ having identified an increasing dissatisfaction with pixelby-pixel image analysis. Although this critique was not new (Cracknell 1998; see also Blaschke and Strobl 2001; Burnett and Blaschke 2003; Blaschke 2010; Blaschke et al. 2014 for a more thorough discussion), these authors described a need for applications beyond pixels and for specific methods and methodologies that support this (Figure 14.1)."

"MORRISON, John H",Estrogen Alters the Synaptic Distribution of Phospho-GluN2B in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex While Promoting Working Memory in Aged Rhesus Monkeys,"Age- and menopause-related deficits in working memory can be partially restored with estradiol replacement in women and female nonhuman primates. Working memory is a cognitive function reliant on persistent firing of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) neurons that requires the activation of GluN2B-containing glutamate NMDA receptors. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of phospho-Tyr1472-GluN2B (pGluN2B), a predominant form of GluN2B seen at the synapse, is sensitive to aging or estradiol treatment and coupled to working memory performance. First, ovariectomized young and aged rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) received long-term cyclic vehicle (V) or estradiol (E) treatment and were tested on the delayed response (DR) test of working memory. Then, serial section electron microscopic immunocytochemistry was performed to quantitatively assess the subcellular distribution of pGluN2B. While the densities of pGluN2B immunogold particles in dlPFC dendritic spines were not different across age or treatment groups, the percentage of gold particles located within the synaptic compartment was significantly lower in aged-E monkeys compared to young-E and aged-V monkeys. On the other hand, the percentage of pGluN2B gold particles in the spine cytoplasm was decreased with E treatment in young, but increased with E in aged monkeys. In aged monkeys, DR average accuracy inversely correlated with the percentage of synaptic pGluN2B, while it positively correlated with the percentage of cytoplasmic pGluN2B. Together, E replacement may promote cognitive health in aged monkeys, in part, by decreasing the relative representation of synaptic pGluN2B and potentially protecting the dlPFC from calcium toxicity."

We have previously shown that the 18-kDa mitochondrial translocator protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TSPO) can modulate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Experiments were designed to test the role of the TSPO in a murine pressure-overload model of HF induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Conditional, cardiac-specific TSPO knockout (KO) mice were generated using the Cre-loxP system. TSPO-KO and wild-type (WT) mice underwent TAC for 8 weeks. TAC-induced HF significantly increased TSPO expression in WT mice, associated with a marked reduction in systolic function, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, complex I activity and energetics. In contrast, TSPO-KO mice undergoing TAC had preserved ejection fraction, and exhibited fewer clinical signs of HF and fibrosis. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and energetics were restored in TSPO KO mice, associated with decreased ROS, improved complex I activity and preserved mitophagy. Thus, HF increases TSPO expression, while preventing this increase limits the progression of HF, preserves ATP production and decreases oxidative stress, thereby preventing metabolic failure. These findings suggest that pharmacological interventions directed at TSPO may provide novel therapeutics to prevent or treat HF."
"ROSHANRAVAN, Baback","Coenzyme Q10 dose-escalation study in hemodialysis patients: safety, tolerability, and effect on oxidative stress","BackgroundCoenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation improves mitochondrial coupling of respiration to oxidative phosphorylation, decreases superoxide production in endothelial cells, and may improve functional cardiac capacity in patients with congestive heart failure. There are no studies evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of varying doses of CoQ10 in chronic hemodialysis patients, a population subject to increased oxidative stress.MethodsWe performed a dose escalation study to test the hypothesis that CoQ10 therapy is safe, well-tolerated, and improves biomarkers of oxidative stress in patients receiving hemodialysis therapy. Plasma concentrations of F2-isoprostanes and isofurans were measured to assess systemic oxidative stress and plasma CoQ10 concentrations were measured to determine dose, concentration and response relationships.ResultsFifteen of the 20 subjects completed the entire dose escalation sequence. Mean CoQ10 levels increased in a linear fashion from 704 Â± 286 ng/mL at baseline to 4033 Â± 1637 ng/mL, and plasma isofuran concentrations decreased from 141 Â± 67.5 pg/mL at baseline to 72.2 Â± 37.5 pg/mL at the completion of the study (P = 0.003 vs. baseline and P < 0.001 for the effect of dose escalation on isofurans). Plasma F2-isoprostane concentrations did not change during the study.ConclusionsCoQ10 supplementation at doses as high as 1800 mg per day was safe in all subjects and well-tolerated in most. Short-term daily CoQ10 supplementation decreased plasma isofuran concentrations in a dose dependent manner. CoQ10 supplementation may improve mitochondrial function and decrease oxidative stress in patients receiving hemodialysis.Trial registrationThis clinical trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov [NCT00908297] on May 21, 2009."

"BRUST, Kelsey D",Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor in the Pelvic Limb of a Domestic Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus),"A 3-year-old, 4.0 kg, female, spayed Silver Marten cross rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was presented for evaluation of a suspected recurring spindle cell sarcoma following primary excision by the referring veterinarian. Physical examination revealed a large subcutaneous mass on the left metatarsus and a fine needle aspirate revealed suspected neoplastic spindle cells. Hematologic evaluation was unremarkable and a computed tomography scan revealed invasion of the mass into skeletal muscles but showed no evidence of metastatic disease. An amputation was performed, after which the patient recovered uneventfully. However, the rabbit was found suddenly dead at time of discharge from unknown cause. Gross, histologic, and immunohistochemical evaluation was performed, which diagnosed a peripheral nerve sheath tumor. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first detailed case report of a lagomorph peripheral nerve sheath tumor specifically confirmed with immunohistochemistry. Wide surgical excision is considered the treatment of choice and may be combined with radiation therapy. Further research is required to determine risk factors, the role of adjunctive therapy, as well as long-term prognoses for peripheral nerve sheath tumors in rabbits."

We demonstrate how this approach can be applied to examine associations between multiple time-varying exposures and subsequent health outcomes, where the former are recorded sparsely and irregularly in time, with emphasis on the utility of multiple longitudinal observations in the framework of dimension reduction techniques. In applications to children's growth data, we investigate archetypes of infant growth patterns and identify subgroups that are related to cognitive development in childhood. Specifically, ""Stunting"" and ""Faltering"" time-dynamic patterns of head circumference, body length and weight in the first 12 months are associated with lower levels of long-term cognitive development in comparison to ""Generally Large"" and ""Catch-up"" growth. Our findings provide evidence for the statistical association between multivariate growth patterns in infancy and long-term cognitive development."
"FIEHN, Oliver",Human-like hyperplastic prostate with low ZIP1 induced solely by Zn deficiency in rats,"Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in men over 50 years of age, and there is a characteristic marked decrease in Zn content in the malignant prostate cells. The cause and consequences of this loss have thus far been unknown. We found that in middle-aged rats a Zn-deficient diet reduces prostatic Zn levels (P = 0.025), increases cellular proliferation, and induces an inflammatory phenotype with COX-2 overexpression. This hyperplastic/inflammatory prostate has a human prostate cancer-like microRNA profile, with up-regulation of the Zn-homeostasis-regulating miR-183-96-182 cluster (fold change = 1.41-2.38; P = 0.029-0.0003) and down-regulation of the Zn importer ZIP1 (target of miR-182), leading to a reduction of prostatic Zn. This inverse relationship between miR-182 and ZIP1 also occurs in human prostate cancer tissue, which is known for Zn loss. The discovery that the Zn-depleted middle-aged rat prostate has a metabolic phenotype resembling that of human prostate cancer, with a 10-fold down-regulation of citric acid (P = 0.0003), links citrate reduction directly to prostatic Zn loss, providing the underlying mechanism linking dietary Zn deficiency with miR-183-96-182 overexpression, ZIP1 down-regulation, prostatic Zn loss, and the resultant citrate down-regulation, changes mimicking features of human prostate cancer. Thus, dietary Zn deficiency during rat middle age produces changes that mimic those of human prostate carcinoma and may increase the risk for prostate cancer, supporting the need for assessment of Zn supplementation in its prevention."
"SHIRURE, Venktesh S",Tumor-on-a-chip platform to investigate progression and drug sensitivity in cell lines and patient-derived organoids.,"Most cancer treatment strategies target cell proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and intravasation of tumor cells in an attempt to limit tumor growth and metastasis. An in vitro platform to assess tumor progression and drug sensitivity could provide avenues to enhance our understanding of tumor metastasis as well as precision medicine. We present a microfluidic platform that mimics biological mass transport near the arterial end of a capillary in the tumor microenvironment. A central feature is a quiescent perfused 3D microvascular network created prior to loading tumor cells or patient-derived tumor organoids in an adjacent compartment. The physiological delivery of nutrients and/or drugs to the tumor then occurs through the vascular network. We demonstrate the culture, growth, and treatment of tumor cell lines and patient-derived breast cancer organoids. The platform provides the opportunity to simultaneously and dynamically observe hallmark features of tumor progression including cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cell migration, and tumor cell intravasation. Additionally, primary breast tumor organoids are viable in the device for several weeks and induce robust sprouting angiogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our platform for drug discovery and personalized medicine by analyzing the response to chemo- and anti-angiogenic therapy. Precision medicine-based cancer treatments can only be realized if individual tumors can be rapidly assessed for therapeutic sensitivity in a clinically relevant timeframe (âª…14 days). Our platform indicates that this goal can be achieved and provides compelling opportunities to advance precision medicine for cancer."
"STEWART, Susan L",The Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking Project: Impact of Statewide Outreach Through Health Channels.,"IntroductionLittle is known about how incentives may encourage low income smokers to call for quitline services. This study evaluates the impact of outreach through health channels on California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) quitline caller characteristics, trends, and reach.Study designLongitudinal study.Setting/participantsMedi-Cal quitline callers.InterventionStatewide outreach was conducted with health providers, Medi-Cal plans (all-household mailings with tracking codes), and public health organizations (March 2012-July 2015). For incentives, Medi-Cal callers could ask for a $20 gift card; in September 2013, callers were offered free nicotine patches.Main outcome measuresCaller characteristics were compared with chi-square analyses, joinpoint analysis of call trends was performed accounting for Medi-Cal population growth, referral source among Medi-Cal and non-Medi-Cal callers was documented, and the annual percentage of the population reached who called the Helpline was calculated. Analyses were conducted 2016-2018.ResultsTotal Medi-Cal callers were 92,900, a 70% increase from prior annual averages: 12.4% asked for the financial incentive, 17.3% reported the mailing code, and 73.3% received nicotine patches while offered. Among the two thirds of callers who completed counseling, 15.5% asked for the financial incentive, and 13.6% reported the mailing code. A joinpoint analysis showed call trends increased 23% above expected for the Medi-Cal population growth after mailings to providers and members began, and decreased after outreach ended. Annual reach increased from 2.3% (95% CI=2.1, 2.6) in 2011 to peak at 4.5% (95% CI=3.6, 5.3) in 2014. Among subgroups with higher reach rates, some also had higher rates of asking for the financial incentive (African Americans, American Indian), reporting the tracking code (whites), or both (aged 45-64 years). Medi-Cal callers were more likely than non-Medi-Cal callers to report providers (32.3% vs 23.8%) and plans (19.7% vs 1.4%) as their referral source, and less likely to cite media (20.2% vs 44.4%, p<0.001).ConclusionsStatewide outreach through health channels incentivizing Medi-Cal members increased the utilization and reach of quitline services.Supplement informationThis article is part of a supplement entitled Advancing Smoking Cessation in California's Medicaid Population, which is sponsored by the California Department of Public Health."

"BELLONE, Rebecca R",Improved reference genome for the domestic horse increases assembly contiguity and composition,"Recent advances in genomic sequencing technology and computational assembly methods have allowed scientists to improve reference genome assemblies in terms of contiguity and composition. EquCab2, a reference genome for the domestic horse, was released in 2007. Although of equal or better quality compared to other first-generation Sanger assemblies, it had many of the shortcomings common to them. In 2014, the equine genomics research community began a project to improve the reference sequence for the horse, building upon the solid foundation of EquCab2 and incorporating new short-read data, long-read data, and proximity ligation data. Here, we present EquCab3. The count of non-N bases in the incorporated chromosomes is improved from 2.33â€‰Gb in EquCab2 to 2.41â€‰Gb in EquCab3. Contiguity has also been improved nearly 40-fold with a contig N50 of 4.5â€‰Mb and scaffold contiguity enhanced to where all but one of the 32 chromosomes is comprised of a single scaffold."

"ABOU NAJM, Majdi",Can groundwater vulnerability models assess seawater intrusion?,"This study examines the uncertainty associated with two commonly used GIS-based groundwater vulnerability models, DRASTIC and EPIK, in assessing seawater intrusion, a growing threat along coastal urban areas due to overexploitation of groundwater resources. For this purpose, concentrations of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in groundwater samples at three pilot areas along the Eastern Mediterranean were compared with mapped vulnerability predictions obtained through DRASTIC and EPIK. While field measurements demonstrated high levels of groundwater salinity depending on the density of urbanization, both vulnerability assessment methods exhibited a limited ability in capturing saltwater intrusion dynamics. In the three pilot areas, DRASTIC was only able to predict correctly between 8.3 and 55.6% of the salinity-based water quality ranges, while EPIK's predictions ranged between 11.7 and 77.8%. This emphasizing that conventional vulnerability models perform poorly when anthropogenic impacts induce lateral flow processes such as seawater intrusion caused primarily by vertical groundwater extraction."
"HEYER, Wolf D",Homologous Recombination and the Formation of Complex Genomic Rearrangements,"The maintenance of genome integrity involves multiple independent DNA damage avoidance and repair mechanisms. However, the origin and pathways of the focal chromosomal reshuffling phenomena collectively referred to as chromothripsis remain mechanistically obscure. We discuss here the role, mechanisms, and regulation of homologous recombination (HR) in the formation of simple and complex chromosomal rearrangements. We emphasize features of the recently characterized multi-invasion (MI)-induced rearrangement (MIR) pathway which uniquely amplifies the initial DNA damage. HR intermediates and cellular contexts that endanger genomic stability are discussed as well as the emerging roles of various classes of nucleases in the formation of genome rearrangements. Long-read sequencing and improved mapping of repeats should enable better appreciation of the significance of recombination in generating genomic rearrangements."

"BAUMLER, Andreas J",Colonocyte metabolism shapes the gut microbiota,"An imbalance in the colonic microbiota might underlie many human diseases, but the mechanisms that maintain homeostasis remain elusive. Recent insights suggest that colonocyte metabolism functions as a control switch, mediating a shift between homeostatic and dysbiotic communities. During homeostasis, colonocyte metabolism is directed toward oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in high epithelial oxygen consumption. The consequent epithelial hypoxia helps to maintain a microbial community dominated by obligate anaerobic bacteria, which provide benefit by converting fiber into fermentation products absorbed by the host. Conditions that alter the metabolism of the colonic epithelium increase epithelial oxygenation, thereby driving an expansion of facultative anaerobic bacteria, a hallmark of dysbiosis in the colon. Enteric pathogens subvert colonocyte metabolism to escape niche protection conferred by the gut microbiota. The reverse strategy, a metabolic reprogramming to restore colonocyte hypoxia, represents a promising new therapeutic approach for rebalancing the colonic microbiota in a broad spectrum of human diseases."
"DEJONG, Jason",A centrifuge study on the effects of soil gradation on liquefaction potential and dynamic response,"Well-graded, cohesionless alluvial soils are common in the foundations of embankment dams and pose a potential liquefaction risk. Current practice to characterize liquefaction potential uses standard or oversized penetrometers and case-history based relationships developed for clean sands. This assumes that a well-graded soil will behave in a similar manner to a clean sand when subjected to cyclic loading. A series of centrifuge tests on coarse-grained soil mixtures was conducted at the UC Davis Center for Geotechnical Modeling to study the effects of soil gradation on liquefaction potential and dynamic response. Four uniformly-graded soils with mean grain diameters (D50) ranging from 0.18 to 2.58 mm were used to construct five soil mixtures: two uniformly-graded, two gap-graded and one well-graded. All base soils were deposited in an alluvial environment and were not crushed during processing; thus, any variations in minerology or particle shape are assumed to be consistent with natural deposition. Centrifuge models of each mixture were prepared loose (relative density (DR) < 50%) and shaken with 15 sequential uniform sine wave loading events of varying peak base acceleration (PBA). High frequency dynamic measurements were obtained during loading to track the mixturesâ€™ dynamic response. Densification was tracked using both high frequency data and physical measurements. The high hydraulic conductivity of the coarsest, uniformly-graded mixture prevented significant excess pore pressure generation (i.e. Î”u â‰ˆ , defined as liquefaction); however, liquefaction was induced in all other mixtures despite variations in particle size due to lower hydraulic conductivity. Furthermore, the well-graded mixture exhibited a stronger dilative tendency than the clean sand due to its increased packing efficiency."

Dynamical Effects of Stellar Feedback in Low-mass Galaxies at z âˆ¼ 2,"We introduce the OSIRIS Lens-Amplified Survey (OLAS), a kinematic survey of gravitationally lensed galaxies at cosmic noon taken with Keck adaptive optics. In this paper, we present spatially resolved spectroscopy and nebular emission kinematic maps for 17 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses 8 < log(M âˆ—/M o) < 9.8 and redshifts 1.2 < z < 2.3. OLAS is designed to probe the stellar mass (M âˆ—) and specific star formation rate (sSFR) range where simulations suggest that stellar feedback is most effective at driving gaseous outflows that create galaxy-wide potential fluctuations, which can generate dark matter cores. We compare our kinematic data with the trend among sSFR, M âˆ—, and HÎ± velocity dispersion, Ïƒ, from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. Our observations reveal a correlation between sSFR and Ïƒ at fixed M âˆ— that is similar to the trend predicted by simulations: feedback from star formation drives star-forming gas and newly formed stars into more dispersion-dominated orbits. The observed magnitude of this effect is in good agreement with the FIRE simulations, in which feedback alters the central density profiles of low-mass galaxies, converting dark matter cusps into cores over time. Our data support the scenario that stellar feedback drives gaseous outflows and potential fluctuations, which in turn drive dark matter core formation in dwarf galaxies."

As a result, reducing GHG emissions are essential for mitigating some of the most damaging potential impacts associated with climate change and because of the importance and relative size of the transportation sector, it would need to contribute a significant amount of emissions reduction.This report describes the development and use of an U.S. energy system optimization model (US-TIMES) in order to analyze the reductions in GHG emissions that can come about through policy targets.Â  These policy targets induce technology investments and operation in order to satisfy the demand for energy services and environmental policy constraints (notably GHG emission targets).The model development focused on two key areas within the transportation sector, light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles.Â  In the light-duty space, we incorporated consumer choice elements into the energy system optimization framework through increasing consumer heterogeneity and adding non-monetary decision factors such as risk and fueling inconvenience.Â  For heavy-duty vehicles, we adopt a segmentation approach and update vehicle cost and performance assumptions from our recent work. The model is used to project scenarios for low carbon futures from a reference scenario all the way to an 80% GHG reduction target.<a href=""https://ncst.ucdavis.edu/project/development-of-integrated-vehicle-and-fuel-scenarios-for-low-carbon-us-transportation-futures/"">View the NCST Project Webpage"
"HARDMAN, Scott J",A First Look at Vehicle Miles Travelled in Partially-Automated Vehicles,"This paper contributes to research investigating the impact of automated and partially automated vehicles on travel behavior. This contribution comes from taking a first look at the impact of partially/semi-automated (SAE Level 2) vehicles on travel behavior and potential correlations with vehicle miles travelled (VMT). The results of this study are taken from a questionnaire survey of 3,001 plug-in electric (PEV) owners in the USA, of which 347 own a partially-automated vehicle (e.g Tesla Model S with Autopilot). This study looks at the VMT of different vehicle types in the survey including plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and semi-automated BEVs. This comparison reveals that semi-automated BEVs have significantly higher VMT compared to other vehicle types. Least squares regression is used to understand VMT in semi-automated BEVs further. This reveals a significant relationship between commute distance, age, household income, house type, and the frequency of autopilot use, and annual VMT. It is possible that the results are showing a self-selection causality as owners of these vehicles already drove more prior to them selecting a semi-automated BEV. Nevertheless, this model indicates that as the frequency of autopilot use increases, so does annual VMT. Due to the potential for two ways causality this study cannot determine whether there is a causal relationship between the use of semi-automated vehicle technology and additional VMT. It is hoped that this first look at the impact of partially-automated BEVs will encourage more research and debate in this area with the aim of improving policy responses to partially and fully automated vehicles."

"THORNE, James H",A Reference Manual for Caltrans Staff on Regional Advance Mitigation Impact Assessment Methods,"This manual reviews the motivations and methods for transportation project impact assessment under the Regional Advance Mitigation Planning (RAMP) framework. RAMP is a process that creates an inventory of expected environmental impacts from multiple transportation (or other development) projects within a region (Thorne et al. 2009; Thorne et al. 2014). When conducted early in the lifecycle of the projects, such as after projects are identified on long-range transportation plans but prior to being programmed, proposed mitigation can be developed earlier, resulting in efficiencies for both project delivery and budget, and effectiveness of the mitigation developed. The RAMP approach can help avoid the cost of delays and over-runs due to late and fragmented project-by-project environmental planning and mitigation, which in California has been estimated by Caltrans internal reports at $59 million per year (Byrne 2005)."

"VAN DEYNZE, Allen","De novo assembly of the pepper transcriptome (Capsicum annuum): a benchmark for in silico discovery of SNPs, SSRs and candidate genes","Abstract Background Molecular breeding of pepper (Capsicum spp.) can be accelerated by developing DNA markers associated with transcriptomes in breeding germplasm. Before the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the majority of sequencing data were generated by the Sanger sequencing method. By leveraging Sanger EST data, we have generated a wealth of genetic information for pepper including thousands of SNPs and Single Position Polymorphic (SPP) markers. To complement and enhance these resources, we applied NGS to three pepper genotypes: Maor, Early JalapeÃ±o and Criollo de Morelos-334 (CM334) to identify SNPs and SSRs in the assembly of these three genotypes. Results Two pepper transcriptome assemblies were developed with different purposes. The first reference sequence, assembled by CAP3 software, comprises 31,196 contigs from >125,000 Sanger-EST sequences that were mainly derived from a Korean F1-hybrid line, Bukang. Overlapping probes were designed for 30,815 unigenes to construct a pepper Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® microarray for whole genome analyses. In addition, custom Python scripts were used to identify 4,236 SNPs in contigs of the assembly. A total of 2,489 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified from the assembly, and primers were designed for the SSRs. Annotation of contigs using Blast2GO software resulted in information for 60% of the unigenes in the assembly. The second transcriptome assembly was constructed from more than 200 million Illumina Genome Analyzer II reads (80â€“120 nt) using a combination of Velvet, CLC workbench and CAP3 software packages. BWA, SAMtools and in-house Perl scripts were used to identify SNPs among three pepper genotypes. The SNPs were filtered to be at least 50 bp from any intron-exon junctions as well as flanking SNPs. More than 22,000 high-quality putative SNPs were identified. Using the MISA software, 10,398 SSR markers were also identified within the Illumina transcriptome assembly and primers were designed for the identified markers. The assembly was annotated by Blast2GO and 14,740 (12%) of annotated contigs were associated with functional proteins. Conclusions Before availability of pepper genome sequence, assembling transcriptomes of this economically important crop was required to generate thousands of high-quality molecular markers that could be used in breeding programs. In order to have a better understanding of the assembled sequences and to identify candidate genes underlying QTLs, we annotated the contigs of Sanger-EST and Illumina transcriptome assemblies. These and other information have been curated in a database that we have dedicated for pepper project."

FMRP is an RNA carrier protein that controls the translation of several other genes that regulate synaptic development and plasticity. Autism occurs in approximately 30% of FXS cases, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) occurs in an additional 30% of cases. Premutation repeat expansions (55 to 200 CGG repeats) may also give rise to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including both autism and PDD-NOS, through a different molecular mechanism that involves a direct toxic effect of the expanded CGG repeat FMR1 mRNA. RNA toxicity can also lead to aging effects including tremor, ataxia and cognitive decline, termed fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), in premutation carriers in late life. In studies of mice bearing premutation expansions, there is evidence of early postnatal neuronal cell toxicity, presenting as reduced cell longevity, decreased dendritic arborization and altered synaptic morphology. There is also evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in premutation carriers. Many of the problems with cellular dysregulation in both premutation and full mutation neurons also parallel the cellular abnormalities that have been documented in autism without fragile X mutations. Research regarding dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems in FXS, including the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)1/5 pathway and Î³ aminobutyric acid (GABA)A pathways, have led to new targeted treatments for FXS. Preliminary evidence suggests that these new targeted treatments will also be beneficial in non-fragile X forms of autism."

Studying the effects of forecasting methods on potential biases may help modelers, planners and policy makers better use the forecasting tools. This paper addresses overestimation of telecommuting as a travel demand management (TDM) policy. The research hypothesis underlying this study posits that overestimates are virtually inevitable in forecasting the effect of new policies that aim to change travel behavior, but these biases eventually decline over time. The sources of overestimated forecast are the prediction tools used, and the ways in which modelers use these tools. The sources of the reduction in overestimation are the changes made to the modeling tools results from knowledge and data gained over time."

We apply the Rausser-Simon multilateral bargaining model to a specific negotiation process involving water storage capacity and use in the upper Adour Basin in southwestern France. We focus on a coalition of three stakeholder groups with aligned but distinct interests. In addition to the standard indices of bargaining power-the distribution of political weights (""access"") and players' utilities if an agreement is not reached, our analysis identifi es other less obvious sources of power. First, a coalition member may benefit when his access is reduced if the redistribution increases the access of another coalition member who has a more favorable ""strategic location."" Second, the interests of the coalition as a whole will usually, but not always, be advanced if its members cede access to a ""spokesman"" representing their common interests. However, some members may be adversely affected. Third, restricting the extent to which coalition members can make proposals that further their own individual interests at the expense of other coalition members will usually, but not always, harm the coalition as a whole."

Retinal expression of CCL2 increased just prior to a transient period of CCR2+ cell extravasation from the retinal vasculature. Proliferation of microglia and monocytes occurred concurrently; however, there was no indication of proliferation in either population until 72-96&nbsp;h after neurodegeneration began. Eliminating CCL2-CCR2 signaling blocked monocyte recruitment, but did not alter the extent of retinal degeneration.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that the immune response to photoreceptor degeneration includes both resident microglia and monocytes, even at very early times. Surprisingly, preventing monocyte infiltration did not block neurodegeneration, suggesting that in this model, degeneration is limited by cell clearance from other phagocytes or by the timing of intrinsic cell death programs. These results show monocyte involvement is not limited to disease states that overwhelm or deplete the resident microglial population and that interventions focused on modulating the peripheral immune system are not universally beneficial for staving off degeneration."

"RANGAMANI, Mukund",The Holographic Entropy Arrangement,"We develop a convenient framework for characterizing multipartite entanglement in composite systems, based on relations between entropies of various subsystems. This continues the program initiated in [1], of using holography to effectively recast the geometric problem into an algebraic one. We prove that, for an arbitrary number of parties, our procedure identifies a finite set of entropic information quantities that we conveniently represent geometrically in the form of an arrangement of hyperplanes. This leads us to define the holographic entropy arrangement, whose algebraic and combinatorial aspects we explore in detail. Using the framework, we derive three new information quantities for four parties, as well as a new infinite family for any number of parties. A natural construct from the arrangement is the holographic entropy polyhedron which captures holographic entropy inequalities describing the physically allowed region of entropy space. We illustrate how to obtain the polyhedron by winnowing down the arrangement through a sieve to pick out candidate sign-definite information quantities. Comparing the polyhedron with the holographic entropy cone, we find perfect agreement for 4 parties and corroborating evidence for the conjectured 5-party entropy cone. We work with explicit configurations in arbitrary (time-dependent) states leading to both simple derivations and an intuitive picture of the entanglement&nbsp;pattern."
"SHAHLAIE, Kiarash",Clinically indicated electrical stimulation strategies to treat patients with medically refractory epilepsy,"Focal epilepsies represent approximately half of all diagnoses, and more than one-third of these patients are refractory to pharmacologic treatment. Although resection can result in seizure freedom, many patients do not meet surgical criteria, as seizures may be multifocal in origin or have a focus in an eloquent region of the brain. For these individuals, several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved electrical stimulation paradigms serve as alternative options, including vagus nerve stimulation, responsive neurostimulation, and stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. All of these are safe, flexible, and lead to progressive seizure control over time when used as an adjunctive therapy to antiepileptic drugs. Focal epilepsies frequently involve significant comorbidities such as cognitive decline. Similar to antiepilepsy medications and surgical resection, current stimulation targets and parameters have yet to address cognitive impairments directly, with patients reporting persistent comorbidities associated with focal epilepsy despite a significant reduction in the number of their seizures. Although low-frequency theta oscillations of the septohippocampal network are critical for modulating cellular activity and, in turn, cognitive processing, the coordination of neural excitability is also imperative for preventing seizures. In this review, we summarize current FDA-approved electrical stimulation paradigms and propose that theta oscillations of the medial septal nucleus represent a novel neuromodulation target for concurrent seizure reduction and cognitive improvement in epilepsy. Ultimately, further advancements in clinical neurostimulation strategies will allow for the efficient treatment of both seizures and comorbidities, thereby improving overall quality of life for patients with epilepsy."
"GILBERT, Matthew E",Root and shoot variation in relation to potential intermittent drought adaptation of Mesoamerican wild common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.),"BackgroundWild crop relatives have been potentially subjected to stresses on an evolutionary time scale prior to domestication. Among these stresses, drought is one of the main factors limiting crop productivity and its impact is likely to increase under current scenarios of global climate change. We sought to determine to what extent wild common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) exhibited adaptation to drought stress, whether this potential adaptation is dependent on the climatic conditions of the location of origin of individual populations, and to what extent domesticated common bean reflects potential drought adaptation.MethodsAn extensive and diverse set of wild beans from across Mesoamerica, along with a set of reference Mesoamerican domesticated cultivars, were evaluated for root and shoot traits related to drought adaptation. A water deficit experiment was conducted by growing each genotype in a long transparent tube in greenhouse conditions so that root growth, in addition to shoot growth, could be monitored.ResultsPhenotypic and landscape genomic analyses, based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms, suggested that beans originating from central and north-west Mexico and Oaxaca, in the driest parts of their distribution, produced more biomass and were deeper-rooted. Nevertheless, deeper rooting was correlated with less root biomass production relative to total biomass. Compared with wild types, domesticated types showed a stronger reduction and delay in growth and development in response to drought stress. Specific genomic regions were associated with root depth, biomass productivity and drought response, some of which showed signals of selection and were previously related to productivity and drought tolerance.ConclusionsThe drought tolerance of wild beans consists in its stronger ability, compared with domesticated types, to continue growth in spite of water-limited conditions. This study is the first to relate bean response to drought to environment of origin for a diverse selection of wild beans. It provides information that needs to be corroborated in crosses between wild and domesticated beans to make it applicable to breeding programmes."

Risk of disease progression (39% vs 17.5%, p&nbsp;= 0.02) and alienating patients (17.5% vs 8.8%, p&nbsp;= 0.04) were very important considerations of those who do not require smoking cessation versus those who do. Only 19 (9.5%) always refer to a smoking cessation program and prescribe nicotine replacement therapy and even fewer, 9 (4.5%), always refer to a program and prescribe medical therapy.ConclusionsThoracic surgeons are divided on their beliefs and practices regarding smoking cessation before lung resection. Most believe patient factors are the main barrier to quitting and have concerns about disease progression while awaiting cessation. Very few surgeons refer to a smoking cessation program and prescribe nicotine replacement therapy or medical therapy."

"BURNS, Marie E",Novel window for cancer nanotheranostics: non-invasive ocular assessments of tumor growth and nanotherapeutic treatment efficacy in vivo.,"In cancer research there is a fundamental need for animal models that allow the in vivo longitudinal visualization and quantification of tumor development, nanotherapeutic delivery, the tumor microenvironment including blood vessels, macrophages, fibroblasts, immune cells, and extracellular matrix, and the tissue response to treatment. To address this need, we developed a novel mouse ocular xenograft model. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing human glioblastoma cells (between 500 and 10,000) were implanted into the subretinal space of immunodeficient mice (56 eyes). The resultant xenografts were imaged in vivo non-invasively with combined fluorescence scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and volumetric optical coherence tomography (OCT) for a period up to several months. Most xenografts exhibited a latent phase followed by a stable or rapidly increasing volume, but about 1/3 underwent spontaneous remission. After prescribed growth, a population of tumors was treated with intravenously delivered doxorubicin-containing porphyrin and cholic acid-based nanoparticles (""nanodox""). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) emission (doxorubicin â†’ porphyrin) was used to localize nanodox in the xenografts, and 690 nm light exposure to activate it. Such photo-nanotherapy was highly effective in reducing tumor volume. Histopathology and flow cytometry revealed CD4 + and CD8 + immune cell infiltration of xenografts. Overall, the ocular model shows potential for examining the relationships between neoplastic growth, neovascularization and other features of the immune microenvironment, and for evaluating treatment response longitudinally in vivo."

All dogs were administered a dose of 30â€‰mg/m2 by intravenous infusion and serum samples were collected at 5, 45 and 60 minutes post-infusion. DOX and its major metabolite, doxorubicinol (doxol), were quantified in serum samples using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. Wide interpatient variability was observed in the predicted DOX AUC with a coefficient of variation of 34%. A significant relationship was found between DOX AUC and absolute white blood cell count (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003), absolute neutrophil count (ANC; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) and surviving fraction of neutrophils (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) approximately 1 week after dosing (nadir). No changes in other hematologic parameters (red blood cells, platelets, lymphocytes, haemoglobin) were found to correlate with DOX AUC. The absolute dose (mg) and the dose per unit body weight (mg/kg) were not significantly correlated with nadir ANC. No relationships were found between maximum serum doxol concentration and myelosuppression. Baseline ANC was also significantly correlated to nadir ANC and a model was constructed using baseline ANC and DOX AUC that significantly described the nadir ANC. These findings demonstrate the important relationship between systemic DOX exposure and degree of neutropenia in dogs, and suggest a potential for individualized, pharmacokinetically-guided DOX dosing in dogs."

The 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced murine oral and esophageal cancer model is frequently used to assess the effects of preventive and/or therapeutic agents. We used this model to assess the impact of the microbiome on tumorigenesis using axenic (germ-free) and conventionally housed mice. Increased toxicity was observed in germ-free mice, however, no difference in tumor incidence, multiplicity, and size was observed. Transcriptional profiling of liver tissue from germ-free and conventionally housed mice identified 254 differentially expressed genes including ten cytochrome p450 enzymes, the largest family of phase-1 drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver. Gene ontology revealed that differentially expressed genes were enriched for liver steatosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in livers of germ-free mice. Our observations emphasize the importance of the microbiome in mediating chemical toxicity at least in part by altering host gene expression. Studies on the role of the microbiome in chemical-induced cancer using germ-free animal models should consider the potential difference in dose due to the microbiome-mediated changes in host metabolizing capacity, which might influence the ability to draw conclusions especially for tumor induction models that are dose dependent."
"SCHMIDT, Rebecca J",Polychlorinated biphenyls influence on autism spectrum disorder risk in the MARBLES cohort,"BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is suspected to have environmental and genetic contributions. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental risk factors of interest due to their potential as neurodevelopmental toxicants and environmental persistence despite a US production ban in the 1970s.MethodsParticipants were mother-child pairs from MARBLES, a high-risk pregnancy cohort that enrolls families who have one child diagnosed with ASD and are planning to have another child. PCB concentrations were measured in maternal blood at each trimester of pregnancy using gas chromatography coupled with triple quadruple mass spectrometry. Concentrations were summed into total PCB and two categories based on function/mechanisms of action: dioxin-like (DL), and ryanodine receptor (RyR)-activating PCBs. Multinomial logistic regression assessed risk of clinical outcome classification of ASD and non-typical development (Non-TD) compared to typically developing (TD) in the children at 3 years old.ResultsA total of 104 mother-child pairs were included. There were no significant associations for total PCB; however, there were borderline significant associations between DL-PCBs and decreased risk for Non-TD outcome classification (adjusted OR: 0.41 (95% CI 0.15-1.14)) and between RyR-activating PCBs and increased risk for ASD outcome classification (adjusted OR: 2.63 (95% CI 0.87-7.97)).ConclusionThis study does not provide strong supporting evidence that PCBs are risk factors for ASD or Non-TD. However, these analyses suggest the need to explore more deeply into subsets of PCBs as risk factors based on their function and structure in larger cohort studies where non-monotonic dose-response patterns can be better evaluated."
"CHEN, Xi",Regioselective One-Pot Multienzyme (OPME) Chemoenzymatic Strategies for Systematic Synthesis of Sialyl Core 2 Glycans,"O-GalNAc glycans or mucin-type glycans are common protein post-translational modifications in eukaryotes. Core 2 O-GalNAc glycans are branched structures that are broadly distributed in glycoproteins and mucins of all types of cells. To better understand their biological roles, it is important to obtain structurally defined Core 2 O-GalNAc glycans. We present here regioselective one-pot multienzyme (OPME) chemoenzymatic strategies to systematically access a diverse array of sialyl Core 2 glycans. Regioselectivity can be achieved by using OPME systems containing a glycosyltransferase with restricted acceptor specificity or by differentiating the branches using altered glycosylation sequences. This work provides a general regioselective strategy to access diverse Core 2 O-GalNAc glycans which can be extended for the synthesis of other complex branched glycans."

"BECKLES, Diane M",Dynamic changes in the starch-sugar interconversion within plant source and sink tissues promote a better abiotic stress response,"Starch is a significant store of sugars, and the starch-sugar interconversion in source and sink tissues plays a profound physiological role in all plants. In this review, we discuss how changes in starch metabolism can facilitate adaptive changes in source-sink carbon allocation for protection against environmental stresses. The stress-related roles of starch are described, and published mechanisms by which starch metabolism responds to short- or long-term water deficit, salinity, or extreme temperatures are discussed. Numerous examples of starch metabolism as a stress response are also provided, focusing on studies where carbohydrates and cognate enzymes were assayed in source, sink, or both. We develop a model that integrates these findings with the theoretical and known roles of sugars and starch in various species, tissues, and developmental stages. In this model, localized starch degradation into sugars is vital to the plant cold stress response, with the sugars produced providing osmoprotection. In contrast, high starch accumulation is prominent under salinity stress, and is associated with higher assimilate allocation from source to sink. Our model explains how starch-sugar interconversion can be a convergent point for regulating carbon use in stress tolerance at the whole-plant level."
"BENNETT, Deborah",Consensus Modeling of Median Chemical Intake for the U.S. Population Based on Predictions of Exposure Pathways,"Prioritizing the potential risk posed to human health by chemicals requires tools that can estimate exposure from limited information. In this study, chemical structure and physicochemical properties were used to predict the probability that a chemical might be associated with any of four exposure pathways leading from sources-consumer (near-field), dietary, far-field industrial, and far-field pesticide-to the general population. The balanced accuracies of these source-based exposure pathway models range from 73 to 81%, with the error rate for identifying positive chemicals ranging from 17 to 36%. We then used exposure pathways to organize predictions from 13 different exposure models as well as other predictors of human intake rates. We created a consensus, meta-model using the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models framework in which the predictors of exposure were combined by pathway and weighted according to predictive ability for chemical intake rates inferred from human biomonitoring data for 114 chemicals. The consensus model yields an R2 of âˆ¼0.8. We extrapolate to predict relevant pathway(s), median intake rate, and credible interval for 479â€¯926 chemicals, mostly with minimal exposure information. This approach identifies 1880 chemicals for which the median population intake rates may exceed 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight/day, while there is 95% confidence that the median intake rate is below 1 Î¼g/kg BW/day for&nbsp;474572&nbsp;compounds."
"BLOOM, Gina",Gaming the Stage,"Rich connections between gaming and theater stretch back to the 16th and 17th centuries, when England's first commercial theaters appeared right next door to gaming houses and blood-sport arenas. In the first book-length exploration of gaming in the early modern period, Gina Bloom shows that theaters succeeded in London's new entertainment marketplace largely because watching a play and playing a game were similar experiences. Audiences did not just see a play; they were encouraged to play the play, and knowledge of gaming helped them become better theatergoers. Examining dramas written for these theaters alongside evidence of analog games popular then and today, Bloom argues for games as theatrical media and theater as an interactive gaming technology.Gaming the StageÂ also introduces a new archive for game studies: scenes of onstage gaming, which appear at climactic moments in dramatic literature. Bloom reveals plays to be systems of information for theater spectators: games of withholding, divulging, speculating, and wagering on knowledge. Her book breaks new ground through examinations of plays such asÂ The Tempest, Arden of Faversham,Â A Woman Killed with Kindness, andÂ A Game at Chess; the histories of familiar games such as cards, backgammon, and chess; less familiar ones, likeÂ Game of the Goose; and even a mixed-reality theater videogame."

Medical records were searched for a diagnosis of Candida and animals with culture-confirmed candiduria were enrolled. Controls had bacterial cystitis (dogs and cats) or cutaneous Malassezia infection (dogs only).ResultsAdministration of antibacterial drugs in the 30â€‰days before diagnosis was associated with candiduria in dogs compared to controls with bacterial cystitis (OR 14.5; 95% CI 3.1-66.9) or with Malassezia infection (OR 26.4; 95% CI 3.4-206.7). Antecedent antibacterial drug administration was associated with candiduria in cats (OR 15.7; 95% CI 1.9-132.3). Immunosuppression was associated with candiduria in dogs when compared to controls with Malassezia infection (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.4-12.8), but not significantly when compared to dogs with bacterial cystitis (OR 2.7, 95% CI 0.9-8.0). Lower urinary tract diseases other than infection were associated with candiduria in cats (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.6-27.9), but not significantly in dogs (OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.7-8.7). Neither diabetes mellitus nor history of hospitalization was significantly associated with candiduria in either species.Conclusions and clinical importanceThe recent administration of antibacterial drug therapy is a potential risk factor for development of candiduria in dogs and cats. Judicious use of antibacterial drugs might help to prevent candiduria."
"YAROV-YAROVOY, Vladimir",Antibodies and venom peptides: new modalities for ion channels,"Ion channels play fundamental roles in both excitable and non-excitable tissues and therefore constitute attractive drug targets for myriad neurological, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases as well as for cancer and immunomodulation. However, achieving selectivity for specific ion channel subtypes with small-molecule drugs has been challenging, and there currently is a growing trend to target ion channels with biologics. One approach is to improve the pharmacokinetics of existing or novel venom-derived peptides. In parallel, after initial studies with polyclonal antibodies demonstrated the technical feasibility of inhibiting channel function with antibodies, multiple preclinical programmes are now using the full spectrum of available technologies to generate conventional monoclonal and engineered antibodies or nanobodies against extracellular loops of ion channels. After a summary of the current state of ion channel drug discovery, this Review discusses recent developments using the purinergic receptor channel P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7), the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.3 and the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 as examples of targeting ion channels with biologics."

The number of eligible professionals attesting was determined using the attestation data for each year and stage of the program. The proportion of attestations by EHR vendor was calculated using all attestations for each vendor.Main outcome measuresNumbers of ophthalmologists attesting by year and stage of the Medicare EHR Incentive Program, incentive payments, and number of attestations by EHR vendor.ResultsIn the peak year of participation, 51.6% of ophthalmologists successfully attested to MU, compared with 37.1% of optometrists, 50.2% of dermatologists, 54.5% of otolaryngologists, and 64.4% of urologists. Across the 6 years of the program, ophthalmologists received an average of $17â€‰942 in incentive payments compared with $11â€‰105 for optometrists, $16â€‰617 for dermatologists, $20â€‰203 for otolaryngologists, and $23â€‰821 for urologists.

Nonetheless, it has long been known that normal speech also yields large quantities of particles that are too small to see by eye, but are large enough to carry a variety of communicable respiratory pathogens. Here we show that the rate of particle emission during normal human speech is positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude) of vocalization, ranging from approximately 1 to 50 particles per second (0.06 to 3 particles per cm3) for low to high amplitudes, regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic). Furthermore, a small fraction of individuals behaves as ""speech superemitters,"" consistently releasing an order of magnitude more particles than their peers. Our data demonstrate that the phenomenon of speech superemission cannot be fully explained either by the phonic structures or the amplitude of the speech. These results suggest that other unknown physiological factors, varying dramatically among individuals, could affect the probability of respiratory infectious disease transmission, and also help explain the existence of superspreaders who are disproportionately responsible for outbreaks of airborne infectious disease."

Spatial memory measures are promising candidates because they are based on 'visual' or 'non-verbal' cognition, and are commonly tested in both animals and humans. Here, we consider the suitability of spatial memory for strengthening translational links between animals and humans in HD research and clinical trials. We describe findings of spatial memory impairments in human HD and mouse models, including which aspects of spatial memory are most affected and at which time points in disease progression. We also describe the neural systems that underlie spatial memory and link spatial memory impairments to HD neuropathology, focussing on striatal and hippocampal systems. We provide a critical analysis of the literature in terms of the suitability of spatial memory for bridging the translational gap between species. Finally, we discuss possible neural mechanisms that might explain the spatial memory impairments seen in HD, and their relevance to potential treatments."

However, the classical laboratory inbred mouse strains (Mus musculus domesticus), commonly used to test Toxoplasma strain differences in virulence, do not capture the genetic diversity within Mus musculus. Thus, it is possible that Toxoplasma strains that are severely virulent in laboratory inbred mice are avirulent in some other mouse sub-species. Here, we present insight into the responses of individual mouse strains, representing strains of the genetically divergent Mus musculus musculus, Mus musculus castaneus and Mus musculus domesticus, to infection with individual clonal and atypical Toxoplasma strains. We observed that, unlike M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus are resistant to the clonal Toxoplasma strains. For M. m. musculus, we show that this is due to a locus on chromosome 11 that includes the genes that encode the interferon gamma (IFNG)-inducible immunity-related GTPases (Irgs) that can kill the parasite by localising and subsequently vesiculating the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. However, despite the localization of known effector Irgs to the Toxoplasma parasitophorous vacuole membrane, we observed that some atypical Toxoplasma strains are virulent in all the mouse strains tested. The virulence of these atypical strains in M. m. musculus could not be attributed to individual rhoptry protein 5 (ROP5) alleles, a secreted parasite pseudokinase that antagonises the canonical effector Irgs and is indispensable for parasite virulence in laboratory inbred mice (M. m. domesticus). We conclude that murine resistance to Toxoplasma is modulated by complex interactions between host and parasite genotypes and may be independent of known effector Irgs on murine chromosome 11."

We compared the distributional characteristics and Q-Q plots from the standardized scores with the deviation z-scores. Additionally, we examined the relationship between both scoring methods and multiple criterion measures.ResultsWe found evidence that substantial and meaningful variation in cognitive ability on standardized IQ tests among individuals with ID is lost when converting raw scores to standardized scaled, index and IQ scores. Use of the deviation z- score method rectifies this problem, and accounts for significant additional variance in criterion validation measures, above and beyond the usual IQ scores. Additionally, individual and group-level cognitive strengths and weaknesses are recovered using deviation scores.ConclusionTraditional methods for generating IQ scores in lower functioning individuals with ID are inaccurate and inadequate, leading to erroneously flat profiles. However assessment of cognitive abilities is substantially improved by measuring true deviation in performance from standardization sample norms. This work has important implications for standardized test development, clinical assessment, and research for which IQ is an important measure of interest in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and other forms of cognitive impairment."

to understanding the organization and functioning of large-scale, complex
systems. We demonstrate three modalities of information flow from time series X
to time series Y. Intrinsic information flow exists when the past of X is
individually predictive of the present of Y, independent of Y's past; this is
most commonly considered information flow. Shared information flow exists when
X's past is predictive of Y's present in the same manner as Y's past; this
occurs due to synchronization or common driving, for example. Finally,
synergistic information flow occurs when neither X's nor Y's pasts are
predictive of Y's present on their own, but taken together they are. The two
most broadly-employed information-theoretic methods of quantifying information
flow---time-delayed mutual information and transfer entropy---are both
sensitive to a pair of these modalities: time-delayed mutual information to
both intrinsic and shared flow, and transfer entropy to both intrinsic and
synergistic flow. To quantify each mode individually we introduce our
cryptographic flow ansatz, positing that intrinsic flow is synonymous with
secret key agreement between X and Y. Based on this, we employ an
easily-computed secret-key-agreement bound---intrinsic mutual

"WULFF, Heike",Radiation Increases Functional KCa3.1 Expression and Invasiveness in Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly brain tumor, with fast recurrence even after surgical intervention, radio- and chemotherapies. One of the reasons for relapse is the early invasion of surrounding brain parenchyma by GBM, rendering tumor eradication difficult. Recent studies demonstrate that, in addition to eliminate possible residual tumoral cells after surgery, radiation stimulates the infiltrative behavior of GBM cells. The intermediate conductance of Ca2+-activated potassium channels (KCa3.1) play an important role in regulating the migration of GBM. Here, we show that high dose radiation of patient-derived GBM cells increases their invasion, and induces the transcription of key genes related to these functions, including the IL-4/IL-4R pair. In addition, we demonstrate that radiation increases the expression of KCa3.1 channels, and that their pharmacological inhibition counteracts the pro-invasive phenotype induced by radiation in tumor cells. Our data describe a possible approach to treat tumor resistance that follows radiation therapy in GBM patients."

"HACKMANN, Timothy J",Maximizing efficiency of rumen microbial protein production,"Rumen microbes produce cellular protein inefficiently partly because they do not direct all ATP toward growth. They direct some ATP toward maintenance functions, as long-recognized, but they also direct ATP toward reserve carbohydrate synthesis and energy spilling (futile cycles that dissipate heat). Rumen microbes expend ATP by vacillating between (1) accumulation of reserve carbohydrate after feeding (during carbohydrate excess) and (2) mobilization of that carbohydrate thereafter (during carbohydrate limitation). Protozoa account for most accumulation of reserve carbohydrate, and in competition experiments, protozoa accumulated nearly 35-fold more reserve carbohydrate than bacteria. Some pure cultures of bacteria spill energy, but only recently have mixed rumen communities been recognized as capable of the same. When these communities were dosed glucose in vitro, energy spilling could account for nearly 40% of heat production. We suspect that cycling of glycogen (a major reserve carbohydrate) is a major mechanism of spilling; such cycling has already been observed in single-species cultures of protozoa and bacteria. Interconversions of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) may also expend ATP and depress efficiency of microbial protein production. These interconversions may involve extensive cycling of intermediates, such as cycling of acetate during butyrate production in certain butyrivibrios. We speculate this cycling may expend ATP directly or indirectly. By further quantifying the impact of reserve carbohydrate accumulation, energy spilling, and SCFA interconversions on growth efficiency, we can improve prediction of microbial protein production and guide efforts to improve efficiency of microbial protein production in the rumen."

It invariably involves specific and detailed sequences of data analysis and simulation, often with multiple tools and datasets, and the community recognizes improved modularity, reuse, reproducibility, portability and scalability as critical unmet needs in this area. Scientific workflows are a well-recognized strategy for addressing these needs in scientific computing. While there are good examples if the use of scientific workflows in bioinformatics, medical informatics, biomedical imaging and data analysis, there are fewer examples in multi-scale computational modeling in general and cardiac electrophysiology in particular. Cardiac electrophysiology simulation is a mature area of multi-scale computational biology that serves as an excellent use case for developing and testing new scientific workflows. In this article, we develop, describe and test a computational workflow that serves as a proof of concept of a platform for the robust integration and implementation of a reusable and reproducible multi-scale cardiac cell and tissue model that is expandable, modular and portable. The workflow described leverages Python and Kepler-Python actor for plotting and pre/post-processing.

"FARIS, Robert W",Cyberbullying in Children and Youth: Implications for Health and Clinical Practice,"We review the recent literature on cyberbullying and its effects on victimised youth, identifying key points. We conclude that cyberbullying, while following many of the underlying dynamics of more traditional forms of bullying, features some unique qualities that can both magnify the damage caused and make it more difficult to detect. These features include the pervasive, never-ending nature of cyberbullying and the ability to quickly reach large audiences. The potential for anonymity and the related distance afforded by screens and devices compared to in-person interaction allow the cruelty of cyberbullying to go unchecked. Despite the perceived anonymity of cyberbullying, cyberbullying can be perpetrated by friends, who often have intimate knowledge about the victimised youth that can be devastating when made public. Given the difficulty schools face in preventing or even detecting cyberbullying, health care providers are an important ally, due to their knowledge of the youth, the sense of trust they bring to youth, and their independence from the school setting. We conclude by calling for routine screening of bullying by health care providers who deal with paediatric populations."

With highly varied phenotypes and a lack of biomarkers for the different clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment can be difficult.ObjectiveThe aim of the present study was to analyze serum metabolomics profiles of patients with Wilson disease compared to healthy subjects, with the goal of identifying differentially abundant metabolites as potential biomarkers for this condition.MethodsHydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry was used to evaluate the untargeted serum metabolome of 61 patients with WD (26 hepatic and 25 neurologic subtypes, 10 preclinical) compared to 15 healthy subjects. We conducted analysis of covariance with potential confounders (body mass index, age, sex) as covariates and partial least-squares analysis.ResultsAfter adjusting for clinical covariates and multiple testing, we identified 99 significantly different metabolites (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05) between WD and healthy subjects. Subtype comparisons also revealed significantly different metabolites compared to healthy subjects: WD hepatic subtype (67), WD neurologic subtype (57), WD hepatic-neurologic combined (77), and preclinical (36). Pathway analysis revealed these metabolites are involved in amino acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, choline metabolism, and oxidative stress.ConclusionsPatients with WD are characterized by a distinct metabolomics profile providing new insights into WD pathogenesis and identifying new potential diagnostic biomarkers."

The results show that the alloy has the maximum value of strength after peak-aged. The over-aged alloy has the best corrosion resistance, and the under-aged alloy has the best elongation. The sensitivities order of the intergranular corrosion and the exfoliation corrosion from high to low is under-aged, peak-aged and over-aged. This is because that after over-aging, the electrode potential of matrix is increased with a lot of precipitations precipitates from intragranular, meanwhile there are sparsely distributed precipitates and narrow precipitate free zone (PFZ) along grain boundaries, which decrease the anode channel of intergranular corrosion."

Evidence regarding perceptions of PDMPs from different primary care providers, which may impact PDMP utilization for women, is unavailable.ObjectiveTo examine perceived PDMP effectiveness among obstetrician-gynecologists (OB/GYNs) compared to primary care physicians (PCPs).MethodsIndependent surveys of PDMP users in Florida, Kentucky, and California were evaluated based on a Likert-type item to assess perception of PDMP effectiveness in reducing prescription drug abuse and diversion. Response distributions of OB/GYNs versus PCPs were compared using chi-square tests.ResultsIn Florida, there were 41 OB/GYN and 511 PCP respondents; Kentucky, 46 OB/GYNs and 265 PCPs; and California, 41 OB/GYNs and 162 PCPs. In each state OB/GYNs viewed PDMPs as less effective, positive, or useful compared to PCPs (pâ€¯â‰¤â€¯0.01, all states): Florida: 64.1% OB/GYN vs. 83.7% PCP ""agree positive impact""; Kentucky: 45.0% OB/GYN vs. 68.5% PCP ""effective"". California: 73.2% OB/GYN vs. 86.4% PCP ""useful"".ConclusionsThese results suggest OB/GYNs view their state's PDMP as less effective than do PCPs, which may present barriers to PDMP utilization and decrease opportunities for SUD interventions. Engagement of all healthcare team members is needed to inform future strategies and policies to increase PDMP effectiveness."

Having a better understanding of the beliefs and practices of trauma and acute care surgeons regarding discharge pain management may offer potential targets for interventions beyond fixed legal mandates.MethodsAn Institutional Review Board-approved electronic survey was sent to trauma and acute care surgeons who are members of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, and trauma and acute care surgeons and nurse practitioners at a Level 1 trauma center in February 2018. The survey included four case-based scenarios and questions about discharge prescription practices and beliefs.ResultsOf 66 respondents, most (88.1%) were at academic institutions. Mean number of opioid tablets prescribed was 20-30 (range 5-90), with the fewest tablets prescribed for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the most for rib fractures. Few prescribed both opioid and non-opioid medications (22.4% to 31.4 %). Most would not change the number/strength of medications (69.2%), dose (53.9%), or number of tablets of opioids (83.1%) prescribed if patients used opioids regularly prior to their operation. The most common factors that made providers more likely to prescribe opioids were high inpatient opioid use (32.4%), history of opioid use/abuse (24.5%), and if the patient lives far from the hospital (12.9%). Most providers in practice >5 years reported a decrease in opioids (71.9%) prescribed at discharge.ConclusionTrauma and acute care surgeons and nurse practitioners reported decreasing the number/amount of opioids prescribed over time. Patients with high opioid use in the hospital, history of opioid use/abuse, or who live far from the provider may be prescribed more opioids at discharge.Level of evidenceLevel IV."

"RANGANATH, Charan",Stress and the medial temporal lobe at rest: Functional connectivity is associated with both memory and cortisol,"When acute stress is experienced immediately after memory encoding (i.e., post-encoding stress) it can significantly impact subsequent memory for that event. For example, recent work has suggested that post-encoding stress occurring in a different context from encoding impairs memory. However, the neural processes underlying these effects are poorly understood. We aimed to expand this understanding by conducting an analysis of resting functional connectivity in the period following post-encoding stress that occurred in a different context than encoding, using seed regions in the medial temporal lobes known for their roles in memory. In the current study of 44 males randomized to stress (nâ€‰=â€‰23) or control (nâ€‰=â€‰21) groups, we found that stress increased cortisol, impaired recollection of neutral materials, and altered functional connectivity with medial temporal lobe regions. Although stress did not significantly alter hippocampus-amygdala functional connectivity, relative to participants in the control group, participants in the post-encoding stress group showed lower functional connectivity between the hippocampus and a region with a peak in the superior temporal gyrus. Across participants in both groups, functional connectivity between these regions was related to greater increases in cortisol, and it was also inversely related to recollection of neutral materials. In contrast, the stress group showed greater parahippocampal cortex functional connectivity with a region in the left middle temporal gyrus than the control group. Moreover, greater functional connectivity between the parahippocampal cortex and the observed cluster in the middle temporal gyrus was associated with greater cortisol changes from pre- to post-manipulation, but was not related to differences in memory. The results show that post-encoding stress can alter the resting-state functional connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and neocortex, which may help explain how stress impacts memory."

Although nitrene generation by exhaustive deoxygenation is widely accepted as the operating mechanism in the reductive cyclization of nitroaromatics, non-nitrene pathways have only been theorized previously. Here, 2 H-indazole N-oxides were synthesized through an interrupted Cadogan/Davis-Beirut reaction and are presented as direct evidence of competent oxygenated intermediates; mechanistic implications for both reactions are discussed.

All horses received a hay diet and were randomized into 3 treatment groups: pelleted feed combination (PF), pelleted feed combination with magnesium (M), and pelleted feed combination with magnesium-boron (MB) with a week washout of hay only between treatments. Headshaking behavior and biochemical blood variables were assessed at baseline (hay only) and then after each week of supplementation.ResultsAll 3 diet interventions increased blood ionized and total magnesium. Groups M and MB further increased Mg2+ when compared to PF. Horses receiving treatments had a significant reduction in headshaking behavior, as measured by incidence rate ratio (IRR), when compared to unsupplemented hay diet (44% for PF, IRR, 0.558; CI, 0.44, 0.72; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001; 52% for M, IRR, 0.476; CI, 0.37, 0.62; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001; and 64% for MB, IRR, 0.358; CI, 0.27, 0.48; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001).Conclusions and clinical importanceMagnesium in combination with boron had the greatest decrease in headshaking.

"DECARLI, Charles",Cerebral white matter free water: A sensitive biomarker of cognition and function.,"ObjectiveTo determine whether free water (FW) content, initially developed to correct metrics derived from diffusion tensor imaging and recently found to be strongly associated with vascular risk factors, may constitute a sensitive biomarker of white matter (WM) microstructural differences associated with cognitive performance but remains unknown.MethodsFive hundred thirty-six cognitively diverse individuals, aged 77 Â± 8 years, received yearly comprehensive clinical evaluations and a baseline MRI examination of whom 224 underwent follow-up MRI. WM microstructural measures, including FW, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity corrected for FW and WM hyperintensity burden were computed within WM voxels of each individual. Baseline and change in MRI metrics were then used as independent variables to explain baseline and change in episodic memory (EM), executive function (EF), and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores using linear, logistic, and Cox proportional-hazards regressions.ResultsHigher baseline FW and WM hyperintensity were associated with lower baseline EM and EF, higher baseline CDR, accelerated EF and EM decline, and higher probability to transition to a more severe CDR stage (p values <0.01). Annual change in FW was also found to be associated with concomitant change in cognitive and functional performance (p values <0.01).ConclusionsThis study finds cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between FW content and trajectory of cognitive and functional performance in a large sample of cognitively diverse individuals. It supports the need to investigate the pathophysiologic process that manifests increased FW, potentially leading to more severe WM territory injury and promoting cognitive and functional decline."
"CARTER, Cameron S",Preliminary evidence of increased striatal dopamine in a nonhuman primate model of maternal immune activation,"Women exposed to a variety of viral and bacterial infections during pregnancy have an increased risk of giving birth to a child with autism, schizophrenia or other neurodevelopmental disorders. Preclinical maternal immune activation (MIA) models are powerful translational tools to investigate mechanisms underlying epidemiological links between infection during pregnancy and offspring neurodevelopmental disorders. Our previous studies documenting the emergence of aberrant behavior in rhesus monkey offspring born to MIA-treated dams extends the rodent MIA model into a species more closely related to humans. Here we present novel neuroimaging data from these animals to further explore the translational potential of the nonhuman primate MIA model. Nine male MIA-treated offspring and 4 controls from our original cohort underwent in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) scanning at approximately 3.5-years of age using [18F] fluoro-l-m-tyrosine (FMT) to measure presynaptic dopamine levels in the striatum, which are consistently elevated in individuals with schizophrenia. Analysis of [18F]FMT signal in the striatum of these nonhuman primates showed that MIA animals had significantly higher [18F]FMT index of influx compared to control animals. In spite of the modest sample size, this group difference reflects a large effect size (Cohen's dâ€‰=â€‰0.998). Nonhuman primates born to MIA-treated dams exhibited increased striatal dopamine in late adolescence-a hallmark molecular biomarker of schizophrenia. These results validate the MIA model in a species more closely related to humans and open up new avenues for understanding the neurodevelopmental biology of schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders associated with prenatal immune challenge."

Recently, Goto et al. reported (Joule, 2018, 2(3), 509-520) that Al-doped SrTiO3 microparticles, followed by modification with Rh2-yCryO3 support overall water splitting with 0.4% solar to hydrogen efficiency and with 56% apparent quantum yield at 365 nm. Earlier, based on transient IR spectroscopy results, the improved activity of Al:SrTiO3 had been attributed to the removal of Ti3+ deep recombination sites by the Al3+ ions. Here we use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to show that Al3+ incorporation not only reduces the Ti3+ concentration but also diminishes the n-type character of SrTiO3 and shifts the Fermi level to more oxidizing potentials. According to DFT, the electronic structure of Al-doped SrTiO3 depends sensitively on the relative locations of Al3+ and oxygen vacancies sites, with Al3+ ions next to the oxygen vacancies being most effective at suppressing the sub-band gap states. Reduced hole and electron trapping resulting from the elimination of Ti3+ states is confirmed by surface photovoltage spectroscopy and electrochemical scans. These findings not only provide an experimental basis for the superior water splitting activity of Al-doped SrTiO3, under ultraviolet and solar irradiation, but they also suggest that aliovalent doping may be a general method to improve the solar energy conversion properties of metal oxides. Additionally, overall water splitting with a type 1 single bed particle suspension 'baggie' reactor under direct sunlight illumination with 0.11% solar to hydrogen efficiency is also demonstrated for the first time.

All ES is likely metastatic at diagnosis although our methods of detection and classification may not account for this. Progressive disease may arise via a combination of: (1) selection of chemotherapy-resistant clones in primary tumor, (2) signaling from bone or lung microenvironments that may attract tumor cells to distant locations, and/or (3) genetic changes within the ES cells themselves due to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents or other ""hits.""

"YU, Hai",Differential Recognition of Diet-Derived Neu5Gc-Neoantigens on Glycan Microarrays by Carbohydrate-Specific Pooled Human IgG and IgA Antibodies,"Sialic acids (Sias) cover vertebrate cell surface glycans. N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and its hydroxylated form N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are common Sia in mammals. Humans cannot synthesize Neu5Gc but accumulate it on cells through red-meat rich diets, generating numerous immunogenic Neu5Gc-neoantigens. Consequently, humans have diverse anti-Neu5Gc antibodies affecting xenotransplantation, cancer, atherosclerosis, and infertility. Anti-Neu5Gc antibodies circulate as IgG, IgM, and IgA isotypes; however, repertoires of the different isotypes in a large population have not been studied yet. Here, we used glycan microarrays to investigate anti-Neu5Gc IgGs and IgAs in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or pooled human IgA, respectively. Binding patterns on microarrays fabricated with Neu5Gc- and Neu5Ac-glycans, together with inhibition assays, revealed that different IVIG preparations have highly specific anti-Neu5Gc IgG reactivity with closely related repertoires, while IgAs show cross-reactivity against several Neu5Ac-glycans. Such different anti-Neu5Gc IgG/IgA repertoires in individuals could possibly mediate distinctive effects on human diseases."

We examined neonatal vitamin D in relation to the child's later diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay (DD). Children aged 24-60â€‰months enrolled in the population-based CHARGE case-control study were evaluated clinically for ASD (nâ€‰=â€‰357), DD (nâ€‰=â€‰134), or typical development (TD, nâ€‰=â€‰234) at the MIND Institute (Sacramento, CA) using standardized assessments. Total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) was measured using sensitive isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in archived dried blood spots collected for the California Department of Public Health's Newborn Screening Program. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate ORs as measures of the associations between 25â€‰nmol/L change in 25(OH)D and ASD and DD. Associations between 25(OH)D and scores on Mullen Scales of Early Learning and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales were assessed using robust linear regression. Effect modification was examined using stratified models and interaction product terms. Unadjusted mean (SD) 25(OH)D was lower for DD (73.2 [37.6]) than for TD (82.7 [39.3]) and ASD (80.1 [37.4]). After adjustment for maternal prepregnancy body mass index and education, a 25â€‰nmol/L increase in total 25(OH)D was not associated with ASD (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.97; CI: 0.87-1.08) or DD (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.91; 95% CI: 0.78-1.06).

We examined neonatal total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) measured in dried blood spots in relation to later diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay (DD) and related assessment scores. Higher neonatal 25(OH)D was associated with a 26% reduction in the odds for ASD only in females. After taking into account factors that could contribute to vitamin D status, a significant association with 21% reduced odds for DD was found only in non-Hispanic white children.

"GRANDI, Eleonora",Antiarrhythmic mechanisms of beta blocker therapy,"Sympathetic activity plays an important role in modulation of cardiac rhythm. Indeed, while exerting positive tropic effects in response to physiologic and pathologic stressors, Î²-adrenergic stimulation influences cardiac electrophysiology and can lead to disturbances of the heart rhythm and potentially lethal arrhythmias, particularly in pathological settings. For this reason, Î²-blockers are widely utilized clinically as antiarrhythmics. In this review, the molecular mechanisms of Î²-adrenergic action in the heart, the cellular and tissue level cardiac responses to Î²-adrenergic stimulation, and the clinical use of Î²-blockers as antiarrhythmic agents are reviewed. We emphasize the complex interaction between cardiomyocyte signaling, contraction, and electrophysiology occurring over multiple time- and spatial-scales during pathophysiological responses to Î²-adrenergic stimulation. An integrated understanding of this complex system is essential for optimizing therapies aimed at preventing arrhythmias."

The study objective was to document case management of ECoV in adult horses presented to a referral hospital and compare to a cohort of horses that tested negative for ECoV. A retrospective case series was performed based on positive real-time quantitative PCR results for ECoV on faeces from horses treated at the UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital from 1 March 2012 to 31 March 2018. Horses negative for ECoV were matched to the ECoV-positive group as controls. Data collected included signalment, history, exam findings, diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up. Thirty-three horses (median age, 11â€‰years; range, 2-37 years) tested ECoV-positive, including three horses with co-infections. Presenting complaints for ECoV-infected horses included historic fevers (nâ€‰=â€‰25/30; 83%), anorexia (nâ€‰=â€‰14/30; 47%), and colic (nâ€‰=â€‰13/30; 43%). ECoV-positive horses had significantly lower white blood cell (median, 3.0â€‰Ã—â€‰109/L; range, 0.68-16.2â€‰Ã—â€‰109/L), neutrophil (median, 1.26â€‰Ã—â€‰109/L; range, 0.15-14.4â€‰Ã—â€‰109/L), and lymphocyte (median, 0.86â€‰Ã—â€‰109/L; range, 0.42-3.47â€‰Ã—â€‰109/L) counts than ECoV-negative horses. Electrolyte and metabolic derangements and scant faeces were common. Twenty-seven horses were hospitalised for a median of 5 days (range, 0.5-14 days), with 26/27 (96%) horses surviving to discharge. ECoV infection should be a differential diagnosis for adult horses with fever, colic, anorexia, and leukopenia.

The formation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into three-dimensional spheroids enhances their survival, trophic factor secretion, and tissue-forming potential compared to monodisperse cells (1). Moreover, cell-secreted ECM represents a more complex platform to recapitulate the cues to guide stem cell fate versus individual matrix proteins or functional motifs (2). We previously demonstrated that MSC-secreted ECM increased progenitor cell osteogenic differentiation of diverse origins and donor populations (2). Therefore, we hypothesized that the formation of MSC spheroids enriched with cell-secreted ECM would enhance MSC viability, proliferation and differentiation potential."

"SHAIKH, Ulfat",A three-year multifaceted intervention to prevent obesity in children of Mexican-heritage,"BackgroundObesity and overweight have increased dramatically in the United States over the last decades. The complexity of interrelated causal factors that result in obesity needs to be addressed within the cultural dynamic of sub-populations. In this study, we sought to estimate the effects of a multifaceted, community-based intervention on body mass index (BMI) among Mexican-heritage children.MethodsNiÃ±os Sanos, Familia Sana (Healthy Children, Healthy Family) was a quasi-experimental intervention study designed to reduce the rate of BMI growth among Mexican-heritage children in California's Central Valley. Two rural communities were matched based on demographic and environmental characteristics and were assigned as the intervention or comparison community. The three-year intervention included parent workshops on nutrition and physical activity; school-based nutrition lessons and enhanced physical education program for children; and a monthly voucher for fruits and vegetables. Eligible children were between 3 and 8â€‰years old at baseline. Intent-to-treat analyses were estimated using linear mixed-effect models with random intercepts. We ran a series of models for each gender where predictors were fixed except interactions between age groups and obesity status at baseline with intervention to determine the magnitude of impact on BMI.ResultsAt baseline, mean (SD) BMI z-score (zBMI) was 0.97 (0.98) in the intervention group (n&nbsp;=â€‰387) and 0.98 (1.02) in the comparison group (n&nbsp;=â€‰313) (NS). The intervention was significantly associated with log-transformed BMI (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.04 (0.02), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) and zBMI (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.25 (0.12), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04) among boys and log-transformed BMI among obese girls (Î²â€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.04 (0.02), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). The intervention was significantly and inversely associated with BMI in obese boys and girls across all age groups and normal weight boys in the oldest group (over 6â€‰years) relative to their counterparts in the comparison community.ConclusionsA community-based, multifaceted intervention was effective at slowing the rate of BMI growth among Mexican-heritage children. Our findings suggest that practitioners should consider strategies that address gender disparities and work with a variety of stakeholders to target childhood obesity.Trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01900613 .

"GHETTI, Simona",Neural specificity of scene representations is related to memory performance in childhood.,"Successful memory encoding is supported by medial temporal, retrosplenial, and occipital regions, which show developmental differences in recruitment from childhood to adulthood. However, little is known about the extent to which neural specificity in these brain regions, or the distinctiveness with which sensory information is represented, continues to develop during middle childhood and how it contributes to memory performance. The present study used multivariate pattern analysis to examine the distinctiveness of different scene representations in 169 children and 31 adults, and its relation to memory performance. Most children provided data over up to three measurement occasions between 8 and 15 years (267 total scans), allowing us to examine changes in memory and neural specificity over time. Memory performance was lower in children than in adults, and increased in children over time. Different scenes presented during memory encoding could be reliably decoded from parahippocampal, lateral occipital, and retrosplenial regions in children and adults. Neural specificity in children was similar to adults, and did not change reliably over time. Among children, higher neural specificity in scene-processing regions was associated with better memory concurrently. These results suggest that the distinctiveness with which incoming information is represented is important for memory performance in childhood, but other processes operating on these representations support developmental improvements in memory performance over time."

"LAM, Kit",High-affinity peptide ligand LXY30 for targeting Î±3Î²1 integrin in non-small cell lung cancer,"BackgroundÎ±3Î²1 integrin is a promising cancer biomarker and drug target. We previously identified a 9-amino-acid cyclic peptide LXY30 for detecting Î±3Î²1 integrin on the surface of live tumor cells. This study was undertaken to characterize LXY30 in the detection, cellular function, imaging, and targeted delivery of in vitro and in vivo non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models.MethodsThe whole-cell binding assay was performed by incubating NSCLC cells, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with TentaGel resin beads coated with LXY30. In this study, we defined the nanosize EVs as exosomes, which were characterized by flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and Western blots. The function of LXY30 was determined by modulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway by growth inhibition and Western blots. For in vivo biodistribution, mice bearing subcutaneous and intracranial NSCLC xenograft tumors were administrated intraveneously with LXY30-biotin/streptavidin-Cy5.5 complex and then analyzed for in vivo and ex vivo optical imaging and histopathology.ResultsWe showed that LXY30 specifically and sensitively detected Î±3Î²1 integrin-expressing NSCLC cells and tumor-derived exosomes. Tumor DNA isolated from LXY30-enriched plasma exosomes might be used to detect driver oncogenic mutations in patients with metastatic NSCLC. LXY30 only enriches tumor cells but not neutrophils, macrophages, or monocytes in the malignant pleural effusion of NSCLC patients for detecting genomic alterations by next-generation sequencing. LXY30 detected increased Î±3Î²1 integrin expression on the EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to erlotinib compared to parental erlotinib-sensitive EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. We further showed that LXY30 modulated the EGFR signaling pathway independently from another peptide ligand LXW64 targeting Î±vÎ²3 integrin in erlotinib-resistant, EGFR-mutant H1975 cells. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed high Î±3 integrin expression was associated with poor prognosis in lung squamous cell carcinoma. LXY30-biotin/streptavidin-Cy5.5 complex had higher uptakes in the subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts of various Î±3Î²1 integrin-expressing lung adenocarcinoma and patient-derived lung squamous cell carcinoma xenografts while sparing the surrounding normal tissues.ConclusionLXY30 is a promising peptide for the cancer diagnosis and in vivo targeted delivery of imaging agents and cancer drugs in NSCLC, independent of histology and tumor genotype."
"ENGLE-STONE, Reina",A New Statistical Method for Estimating Usual Intakes of Nearly-Daily Consumed Foods and Nutrients Through Use of Only One 24-hour Dietary Recall,"BackgroundTo estimate usual intake distributions of dietary components, collection of nonconsecutive repeated 24-h dietary recalls is recommended, but resource limitations sometimes restrict data collection to single-day dietary data per person.ObjectivesWe developed a new statistical method, the NCI 1-d method, which uses single-day dietary data and an external within-person to between-person variance ratio to estimate population distributions of usual intake of nearly-daily consumed foods and nutrients.MethodsWe used NHANES 2011-2014 data for men (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4938 and n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4293 for the first and second 24-h recalls) to compare nutrient intake distributions of vitamin A, magnesium, folate, and vitamin E generated by the 1-d method (with use of only the first recall per person) with those from the NCI amount-only method (with use of all days of dietary intake per person). The within-person to between-person variance ratio from the amount-only model was used as the unbiased ""external"" estimate for the 1-d method. We also examined the effect of mis-specification of variance ratios on usual intake distributions.ResultsThe amount-only and 1-d methods estimated statistically equivalent median (25p, 75p): 647 (459, 890) compared with 648 (461, 886) Âµg retinol activity equivalents/d, 338 (268, 420) compared with 334 (266, 417) mg magnesium/d, 595 (458, 762) compared with 589 (456, 758) Âµg dietary folate equivalents/d, and 9.7 (7.3, 12.6) compared with 9.6 (7.3, 12.7) mg vitamin E/d. As the external variance ratios increased from 25% to 200% of the unbiased ratios, the prevalence of inadequate intake ranged from 53% to 43% for vitamin A, 57% to 55% for magnesium, 16% to 2% for folate, and 70% to 73% for vitamin E.ConclusionsThe 1-d method is a viable statistical method for estimating usual intakes of nearly-daily consumed dietary components when the variance ratio is unbiased. Results are sensitive to variance ratio selection, so researchers should still collect replicate data where possible."

In this paper, we propose an algorithm, DCG++ that generates such a similarity measure that is data-driven and ultrametric. DCG++ uses Markov Chain Random Walks to capture the intrinsic geometry of data, scans possible scales, and combines all this information using a simple procedure that is shown to generate an ultrametric. We validate the effectiveness of this similarity measure within the context of clustering on synthetic data with complex geometry, on a real-world data set containing segmented audio records of frog calls described by mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, as well as on an image segmentation problem. The experimental results show a significant improvement on performance with the DCG-based ultrametric compared to using an empirical distance measure."

An extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulse populates the autoionizing Rydberg series converging to O2+cÏ‚u-4, and a femtosecond near-infrared (IR) pulse was used to photoionize these states as they dissociate. Monitoring the differential photoelectron spectra as a function of time delay allowed us to obtain the relaxation lifetimes of these Rydberg states. We observed a photoelectron signal corresponding to the formation of a 4p excited atomic oxygen fragment, which is not an expected dissociation product of the (O2+cÏ‚u-4)nlÏƒg Rydberg series. Analysis of the time-dependent photoelectron spectra and photoionization calculations indicate that this fragment results from a previously unexplored (O2+Î g4)4p repulsive state and that, contrary to expectations, this multielectron excitation pathway presents a substantial cross section. Our study demonstrates that two-color time-resolved differential photoelectron spectroscopy is an excellent tool to study the fragmentation dynamics of such multielectron excited states, which are not easily probed by other means."
"MUNGAS, Dan M",Neuropsychological Test Performance and MRI Markers of Dementia Risk,"BackgroundTo use neuropsychological assessments for studying the underlying disease processes contributing to dementia, it is crucial that they correspond to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measures of dementia, regardless of educational level.MethodsFrench 3-City Dijon MRI study cohort members (n=1782) with assessments of white matter lesion volume (WMLV), hippocampal volume (HCV), and cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSFV), and 6 waves of neuropsychological assessments over 11 years, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), plus 5 other tests combined using a Z-score or item-response theory (IRT-cognition) comprised the study cohort. We evaluated, testing interactions, whether education modified associations of MRI markers with intercept or rate of change of MMSE, Z-score composite, or IRT-cognition.ResultsIn linear models, education modified the associations of WMLV and CSFV with MMSE and CSFV and Z-score composite. In mixed models, education modified the associations of WMLV and CSFV with level of MMSE and the association of HCV with slope of MMSE. Education also modified the association with CSFV and slope of Z-score composite decline. There was no evidence that education modified associations between MRI measures and level or slope of IRT-cognition.ConclusionsLongitudinal analysis of correctly scaled neuropsychological assessments may provide unbiased proxies for MRI-based measures of dementia risk."

The use of ANS is expanding to include new indications and gestational ages, although the recommended dosing was never optimized. The most widely used treatment is two intramuscular doses of a 1:1 mixture of betamethasone-phosphate (Beta-P) and betamethasone-acetate (Beta-Ac) - the clinical drug. We tested in a primate model the efficacy of the slow release Beta-Ac alone for enhancing fetal lung maturation and to reduce fetal corticosteroid exposure and potential toxic effects. Pregnant rhesus macaques at 127 days of gestation (80% of term) were treated with either the clinical drug (0.25â€‰mg/kg) or Beta-Ac (0.125â€‰mg/kg). Beta-Ac alone increased lung compliance and surfactant concentration in the fetal lung equivalently to the clinical drug. By transcriptome analyses the early suppression of genes associated with immune responses and developmental pathways were less affected by Beta-Ac than the clinical drug. Promoter and regulatory analysis prediction identified differentially expressed genes targeted by the glucocorticoid receptor in the lung. At 5 days the clinical drug suppressed genes associated with neuronal development and differentiation in the fetal hippocampus compared to control, while low dose Beta-Ac alone did not. A low dose ANS treatment with Beta-Ac should be assessed for efficacy in human trials."
"SHANKAR, Suma","Costello syndrome: Clinical phenotype, genotype, and management guidelines.","Costello syndrome (CS) is a RASopathy caused by activating germline mutations in HRAS.

Individuals with CS may have distinctive craniofacial features, cardiac anomalies, growth and developmental delays, as well as dermatological, orthopedic, ocular, and neurological issues; however, considerable overlap with other RASopathies exists. Medical evaluation requires an understanding of the multifaceted phenotype. Subspecialists may have limited experience in caring for these individuals because of the rarity of CS. Furthermore, the phenotypic presentation may vary with the underlying genotype. These guidelines were developed by an interdisciplinary team of experts in order to encourage timely health care practices and provide medical management guidelines for the primary and specialty care provider, as well as for the families and affected individuals across their lifespan. These guidelines are based on expert opinion and do not represent evidence-based guidelines due to the lack of data for this rare condition."

"YU, Aiming",Bioengineering of a single long noncoding RNA molecule that carries multiple small RNAs,"Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), regulate target gene expression and can be used as tools for understanding biological processes and identifying new therapeutic targets. Currently, ncRNA molecules for research and therapeutic use are limited to ncRNA mimics made by chemical synthesis. We have recently established a high-yield and cost-effective method of producing bioengineered or biologic ncRNA agents (BERAs) through bacterial fermentation, which is based on a stable tRNA/pre-miR-34a carrier (~â€‰180&nbsp;nt) that accommodates target small RNAs. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to heterogeneously express longer ncRNAs (e.g., >â€‰260&nbsp;nt), and it is unknown if single BERA may carry multiple small RNAs. To address this issue, we hypothesized that an additional human pre-miR-34a could be attached to the tRNA/pre-miR-34a scaffold to offer a new tRNA/pre-miR-34a/pre-miR-34a carrier (~â€‰296&nbsp;nt) for the accommodation of multiple small RNAs. We thus designed ten different combinatorial BERAs (CO-BERAs) that include different combinations of miRNAs, siRNAs, and antagomirs. Our data showed that all target CO-BERAs were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli at high levels, greater than 40% in total bacterial RNAs. Furthermore, recombinant CO-BERAs were purified to a high degree of homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography methods. In addition, CO-BERAs exhibited strong anti-proliferative activities against a variety of human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. These results support the production of long ncRNA molecules carrying different warhead small RNAs for multi-targeting which may open avenues for developing new biologic RNAs as experimental, diagnostic, and therapeutic tools."

"HAVEL, Peter J",Galectin-12,"Galectin-12, a member of the galectin family of animal lectins, is preferentially expressed in adipocytes. We recently reported that this galectin is localized on lipid droplets, specialized organelles for fat storage. Galectin-12 regulates lipid degradation (lipolysis) by modulating lipolytic protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. Mice deficient in galectin-12 exhibit enhanced adipocyte lipolysis, increased mitochondria respiration, reduced adiposity and ameliorated insulin resistance associated with weight gain. The results suggest that galectin-12 may be a useful target for treatment of obesity-related metabolic conditions, such as insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Most previously described galectins largely reside in the cytosol, although they can also be induced to become associated with membrane-containing structures. Along with an in-depth characterization of galectin-12, this mini-review comments on this first report of a galectin normally localized specifically in an organelle that performs an important intracellular function. Further studies will help shed light on how this protein regulates cellular homeostasis, especially energy homeostasis, and provide additional insight into the intracellular functions of galectins."
"KEIM, Nancy L",Effects of Fructose or Glucose on Circulating ApoCIII and Triglyceride and Cholesterol Content of Lipoprotein Subfractions in Humans,"ApoCIII and triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TRL), particularly, large TG-rich lipoproteins particles, have been described as important mediators of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The effects of sustained consumption of dietary fructose compared with those of sustained glucose consumption on circulating apoCIII and large TRL particles have not been reported. We measured apoCIII concentrations and the TG and cholesterol content of lipoprotein subfractions separated by size in fasting and postprandial plasma collected from men and women (age: 54 Â± 8 years) before and after they consumed glucose- or fructose-sweetened beverages for 10 weeks. The subjects consuming fructose exhibited higher fasting and postprandial plasma apoCIII concentrations than the subjects consuming glucose (p < 0.05 for both). They also had higher concentrations of postprandial TG in all TRL subfractions (p < 0.05, effect of sugar), with the highest increases occurring in the largest TRL particles (p < 0.0001 for fructose linear trend). Compared to glucose consumption, fructose consumption increased postprandial TG in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles (p < 0.05, effect of sugar), especially in the smaller particles (p < 0.0001 for fructose linear trend). The increases of both postprandial apoCIII and TG in large TRL subfractions were associated with fructose-induced increases of fasting cholesterol in the smaller LDL particles. In conclusion, 10 weeks of fructose consumption increased the circulating apoCIII and postprandial concentrations of large TRL particles compared with glucose consumption."
"TURELLI, Michael",Wolbachia Acquisition by Drosophila yakuba-Clade Hosts and Transfer of Incompatibility Loci Between Distantly Related Wolbachia,"Maternally transmitted Wolbachia infect about half of insect species, yet the predominant mode(s) of Wolbachia acquisition remains uncertain. Species-specific associations could be old, with Wolbachia and hosts codiversifying (i.e., cladogenic acquisition), or relatively young and acquired by horizontal transfer or introgression. The three Drosophila yakuba-clade hosts [(D. santomea, D. yakuba) D. teissieri] diverged âˆ¼3 MYA and currently hybridize on the West African islands Bioko and SÃ£o TomÃ©. Each species is polymorphic for nearly identical Wolbachia that cause weak cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI)-reduced egg hatch when uninfected females mate with infected males. D. yakuba-clade Wolbachia are closely related to wMel, globally polymorphic in D. melanogaster We use draft Wolbachia and mitochondrial genomes to demonstrate that D. yakuba-clade phylogenies for Wolbachia and mitochondria tend to follow host nuclear phylogenies. However, roughly half of D. santomea individuals, sampled both inside and outside of the SÃ£o TomÃ© hybrid zone, have introgressed D. yakuba mitochondria. Both mitochondria and Wolbachia possess far more recent common ancestors than the bulk of the host nuclear genomes, precluding cladogenic Wolbachia acquisition. General concordance of Wolbachia and mitochondrial phylogenies suggests that horizontal transmission is rare, but varying relative rates of molecular divergence complicate chronogram-based statistical tests. Loci that cause CI in wMel are disrupted in D. yakuba-clade Wolbachia; but a second set of loci predicted to cause CI are located in the same WO prophage region. These alternative CI loci seem to have been acquired horizontally from distantly related Wolbachia, with transfer mediated by flanking Wolbachia-specific ISWpi1 transposons."

We examined gill transcriptome responses to salinity in wild-caught juveniles from two populations of Sacramento splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus), a species of conservation concern that is endemic to the San Francisco Estuary, USA, and the lower reaches of its tributaries. Recent extreme droughts have led to salinities above the tolerance limits for this species, creating a migration barrier between these populations, which potentially contributed to population divergence. We identified transcripts involved in a conserved response to salinity; however, the more salinity-tolerant San Pablo population had greater transcriptome plasticity (3.6-fold more transcripts responded than the Central Valley population) and a response consistent with gill remodeling after 168&nbsp;hr of exposure to elevated salinity. The reorganization of the gill in response to changing osmotic gradients is a process critical for acclimation and would facilitate enhanced salinity tolerance. We detected an upregulation of receptors that control the Wnt (wingless-type) cell signaling pathway that may be required for an adaptive response to increases in salinity, patterns not observed in the relatively salinity-sensitive Central Valley population. We detected 62 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding regions of 26 transcripts that differed between the populations. Eight transcripts that contained SNPs were associated with immune responses, highlighting the importance of diversity in immune gene sequences as a defining characteristic of genomic divergence between these populations. Our data demonstrate that these populations have divergent transcriptomic responses to salinity, which is consistent with observed physiological differences in salinity tolerance."

RESULTS:The coverage probability technique showed â‰¥0.90 probability for an acceptable 3TUG difference of â‰¤0.2, indicating that it is reproducible in LEM patients. The correlation between 3TUG times and lower extremity function scores was significant in subjects who continued and in those who were withdrawn from 3,4-diaminopyridine free base. Worsening patient-reported Weakness Self-Assessment Scale and Investigator Assessment of Treatment Effect scores corresponded with prolongation of 3TUG times.

These findings, along with prior reliability studies, indicate 3TUG is a valid measure of disease severity in LEM."
"HAGERMAN, Randi J",New Targeted Treatments for Fragile X Syndrome,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability with prevalence rates estimated to be 1:5,000 in males and 1:8,000 in females. The increase of >200 Cytosine Guanine Guanine (CGG) repeats in the 5' untranslated region of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene results in transcriptional silencing on the FMR1 gene with a subsequent reduction or absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein involved in the maturation and elimination of synapses. In addition to intellectual disability, common features of FXS are behavioral problems, autism, language deficits and atypical physical features. There are still no currently approved curative therapies for FXS, and clinical management continues to focus on symptomatic treatment of comorbid behaviors and psychiatric problems. Here we discuss several treatments that target the neurobiological pathway abnormal in FXS. These medications are clinically available at present and the data suggest that these medications can be helpful for those with FXS."

For RCP4.5, enhanced N availability results in increased tree carbon storage of 27.8 Pg C, with land-use legacy being the most important factor. For RCP8.5, enhanced N availability results in increased carbon storage in trees of 13.4 Pg C, with permafrost degradation being the most important factor. Our analysis reveals complex spatial and temporal patterns of regional carbon storage. This study underscores the importance of considering carbon-nitrogen interactions when assessing regional and sub-regional impacts of global change policies."

"KURZROCK, Eric",Blind ending vessels on diagnostic laparoscopy for nonpalpable testis: Is a nubbin present?,"IntroductionThe traditional management paradigm for nonpalpable testis (NPT) has been that inguinal or scrotal exploration for a nubbin may be omitted when blind ending vessels are observed during diagnostic laparoscopy. Our aim was to examine whether blind ending vessels excluded the presence of a nubbin in a series of boys who underwent exploration in this setting.Materials and methodsUsing a surgical database and chart review, pre-pubertal boys (â‰¤12 years) with the diagnosis of undescended or atrophic testis who underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy for unilateral NPT between 2000 and 2015 were retrospectively identified. Physical exam, procedural and pathologic findings were confirmed by chart review.Results595 boys underwent diagnostic laparoscopy for NPT by 11 surgeons. Of these, 318 had an intra-abdominal testis and 18 underwent diagnostic laparoscopy alone. Of the remaining 259, 32 had an open internal ring and inguinal or scrotal exploration was performed. The remaining 227 with a closed ring comprised the cohort for our analysis, of whom 188 had vessels entering the ring, 36 had blind ending vessels, and in three the vessel status was unavailable. In the 188 boys with vessels entering the ring, 164 (87%) had a nubbin excised during inguinal or scrotal exploration, of which 93% were grossly identified as an atrophic testis. Pathology confirmed the presence of hemosiderin in 44% and calcifications in 54%. In the 36 boys with blind ending vessels, 26 (72%) had a nubbin excised during inguinal or scrotal exploration, of which 96% were grossly identified as an atrophic testis. Pathology confirmed hemosiderin in 54% and calcifications in 58%. All seven cases with both blind ending vas and vessels had an atrophic testis grossly identified. Of all 207 excised remnants in this series, nubbins with viable testicular elements (seminiferous tubules in 11, germ cells in two) were only excised during cases that reported a non-atretic vas or any vessels entering the internal ring.ConclusionIn this large multi-institutional series, blind ending vessels were associated with a nubbin noted during inguinal or scrotal exploration in the majority of cases. Based on this series if the surgeon's goal is to remove all nubbins, exploration is necessary regardless of vessel appearance. However, viable testicular elements were rarely identified and only when either a non-atretic vas or any vessels were observed to enter the ring."
"PITTELKOW, Cameron M",Simulating nitrogen management impacts on maize production in the U.S. Midwest,"Nutrient loss reduction strategies have recently been developed in the U.S. Midwest to decrease the environmental footprint associated with nitrogen (N) fertilizer use. Although these strategies generally suggest decreasing N rates and shifting the timing of N application from fall to spring, the spatiotemporal impacts of these practices on maize yield and fertilizer N use efficiency (NUE, kg grain yield increase per kg N applied) have not been assessed at the watershed scale using crop simulation models. We simulated the effects of N fertilizer rate (0, 168, 190, 224 kg N ha-1) and application timing [fall-applied N (FN): 100% N applied on 1 December; spring-applied N (SN): 100% N applied 10 days before planting; split N: 66% N applied on 1 December + 34% N applied 10 days before planting] on maize grain yield (GY) across 3042 points in Illinois during 2011-2015 using the DSSAT-CERES-Maize model. When simulations were scaled up to the watershed level, results suggest that increases in average maize GY for SN compared to FN occurred in years with higher than average winter rainfall (2011, 2013), whereas yields were similar (+/- 4%) in 2012, 2014, and 2015. Accordingly, differences in NUE for SN compared to FN were small (0.0-1.4 kg GY/kg N) when cumulative winter rainfall was < 300 mm, but increased to 0.1-9.2 kg GY/kg N when winter rainfall was > 500 mm at both 168 kg N ha-1 and 224 kg N ha-1. The combined practice of reducing N fertilizer amounts from 224 kg N ha-1 to 190 kg N ha-1 and shifting from FN to SN resulted in a wide range of yield responses during 2011-2015, with the probability of increasing yields varying from <10% to >70% of simulation points within a watershed. Positive impacts on both GY and NUE occurred in only 60% of simulations for this scenario, highlighting the challenge of simultaneously improving yield and NUE with a 15% N rate reduction in this region."

"GAO, Allen C",AKR1C3 Promotes AR-V7 Protein Stabilization and Confers Resistance to AR-Targeted Therapies in Advanced Prostate Cancer,"The mechanisms resulting in resistance to next-generation antiandrogens in castration-resistant prostate cancer are incompletely understood. Numerous studies have determined that constitutively active androgen receptor (AR) signaling or full-length AR bypass mechanisms may contribute to the resistance. Previous studies established that AKR1C3 and AR-V7 play important roles in enzalutamide and abiraterone resistance. In the present study, we found that AKR1C3 increases AR-V7 expression in resistant prostate cancer cells through enhancing protein stability via activation of the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway. AKR1C3 reprograms AR signaling in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. In addition, bioinformatical analysis of indomethacin-treated resistant cells revealed that indomethacin significantly activates the unfolded protein response, p53, and apoptosis pathways, and suppresses cell-cycle, Myc, and AR/ARV7 pathways. Targeting AKR1C3 with indomethacin significantly decreases AR/AR-V7 protein expression in vitro and in vivo through activation of the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway. Our results suggest that the AKR1C3/AR-V7 complex collaboratively confers resistance to AR-targeted therapies in advanced prostate cancer."

"NUNO, Miriam A",Development of transfusion guidelines for injured children using a Modified Delphi Consensus Process.,"BackgroundThere is wide variability of transfusion practices for children with hemorrhagic injuries across trauma centers. We are planning a multicenter, randomized clinical trial evaluating tranexamic acid in children with hemorrhage. Standardization of transfusion practices across sites is important to minimize confounding. Therefore, we sought to generate consensus-based transfusion guidelines for the trial.MethodsWe used a modified Delphi process utilizing a multi-site, multi-disciplinary panel of experts to develop our transfusion guidelines. A survey of 23 clinical categories on various aspects of transfusion practices was developed and distributed via SurveyMonkeyÂ®. Statements were graded on a 5-point Likert scale (""Strongly agree"" to ""This intervention may be harmful""). Statements were accepted if â‰¥ 80% of the panelists rated the statement as ""Strongly agree"" or ""Agree"". After each round, the responses were calculated and the results included on subsequent rounds.Results35 panelists from four pediatric trauma centers participated in the study, including 11 (31%) pediatric EM physicians, 8 (23%) pediatric trauma surgeons, 5 (14%) transfusionists, 5 (14%) pediatric anesthesiologists, and 6 (17%) pediatric critical care physicians (range of 8 to 10 from each clinical site). Four survey iterations were performed. In total 176 statements were rated and 39 were accepted by criteria across all 23 categories. An rational algorithm for transfusion in trauma was then developed.ConclusionsWe successfully developed transfusion guidelines for various aspects of the management of children with hemorrhagic injuries using a modified Delphi process with broad interdisciplinary participation. We anticipate implementation of these guidelines will help minimize heterogeneity of transfusion practices across clinical sites for the upcoming clinical trial evaluating tranexamic acid in children with hemorrhage."
"BLISS-MOREAU, Eliza",Macaques preferentially attend to visual patterns with higher fractal dimension contours.,"Animals' sensory systems evolved to efficiently process information from their environmental niches. Niches often include irregular shapes and rough textures (e.g., jagged terrain, canopy outlines) that must be navigated to find food, escape predators, and master other fitness-related challenges. For most primates, vision is the dominant sensory modality and thus, primates have evolved systems for processing complicated visual stimuli. One way to quantify information present in visual stimuli in natural scenes is evaluating their fractal dimension. We hypothesized that sensitivity to complicated geometric forms, indexed by fractal dimension, is an evolutionarily conserved capacity, and tested this capacity in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Monkeys viewed paired black and white images of simulated self-similar contours that systematically varied in fractal dimension while their attention to the stimuli was measured using noninvasive infrared eye tracking. They fixated more frequently on, dwelled for longer durations on, and had attentional biases towards images that contain boundary contours with higher fractal dimensions. This indicates that, like humans, they discriminate between visual stimuli on the basis of fractal dimension and may prefer viewing informationally rich visual stimuli. Our findings suggest that sensitivity to fractal dimension may be a wider ability of the vertebrate vision system."
"TANCREDI, Daniel J",Reproductive Coercion and Relationship Abuse Among Adolescents and Young Women Seeking Care at School Health Centers,"ObjectiveTo investigate demographic differences and evaluate how reproductive coercion and relationship abuse influences young females' care-seeking and sexual health behaviors.MethodsWe conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional baseline survey data from sexually active female students (aged 14-19 years) who sought care from school health centers. Outcomes included recent (previous 3 months) reproductive coercion, physical or sexual adolescent relationship abuse, and nonpartner sexual violence victimization. Cluster-adjusted Ï‡ tests compared demographics and generalized linear mixed models estimated associations among reproductive coercion, adolescent relationship abuse (physical and sexual abuse in romantic relationships), and care-seeking and sexual health behaviors.ResultsOf 550 sexually active high school females, 12% reported recent reproductive coercion and 17% reported physical or sexual adolescent relationship abuse, with no significant demographic differences. Prevalence of recent nonpartner sexual violence was 17%. There were no observed significant differences in care-seeking behaviors among those with recent reproductive coercion compared with those without. Physical or sexual adolescent relationship abuse was associated with increased odds of seeking testing or treatment for sexually transmitted infections (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.08, 95% CI 1.05-4.13). Females exposed to both adolescent relationship abuse and reproductive coercion had higher odds of having a partner who was 5 or more years older (aOR 4.66, 95% CI 1.51-14.4), having two or more recent sexual partners (aOR 3.86, 95% CI 1.57-9.48), and using hormonal contraception only (aOR 3.77, 95% CI 1.09-13.1 vs hormonal methods with condoms).ConclusionAlmost one in eight females experienced recent reproductive coercion. We did not observe significant demographic differences in reproductive coercion. Partner age and number of sexual partners may elevate risk for abusive relationships. Relationship abuse is prevalent among high school students seeking care, with no clear pattern for case identification. By failing to identify factors associated with harmful partner behaviors, our results support universal assessment for reproductive coercion and relationship abuse among high school-aged adolescents, involving education, resources, and harm-reduction counseling to all patients.Clinical trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01678378."

"GIULIVI, Cecilia R",Pathogenic WDFY3 variants cause neurodevelopmental disorders and opposing effects on brain size,"The underpinnings of mild to moderate neurodevelopmental delay remain elusive, often leading to late diagnosis and interventions. Here, we present data on exome and genome sequencing as well as array analysis of 13 individuals that point to pathogenic, heterozygous, mostly de novo variants in WDFY3 (significant de novo enrichment P = 0.003) as a monogenic cause of mild and non-specific neurodevelopmental delay. Nine variants were protein-truncating and four missense. Overlapping symptoms included neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, macrocephaly, and psychiatric disorders (autism spectrum disorders/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). One proband presented with an opposing phenotype of microcephaly and the only missense-variant located in the PH-domain of WDFY3. Findings of this case are supported by previously published data, demonstrating that pathogenic PH-domain variants can lead to microcephaly via canonical Wnt-pathway upregulation. In a separate study, we reported that the autophagy scaffolding protein WDFY3 is required for cerebral cortical size regulation in mice, by controlling proper division of neural progenitors. Here, we show that proliferating cortical neural progenitors of human embryonic brains highly express WDFY3, further supporting a role for this molecule in the regulation of prenatal neurogenesis. We present data on Wnt-pathway dysregulation in Wdfy3-haploinsufficient mice, which display macrocephaly and deficits in motor coordination and associative learning, recapitulating the human phenotype. Consequently, we propose that in humans WDFY3 loss-of-function variants lead to macrocephaly via downregulation of the Wnt pathway. In summary, we present WDFY3 as a novel gene linked to mild to moderate neurodevelopmental delay and intellectual disability and conclude that variants putatively causing haploinsufficiency lead to macrocephaly, while an opposing pathomechanism due to variants in the PH-domain of WDFY3 leads to microcephaly."
"CREININ, Mitchell D",Adherence in a Phase 3 Trial of a Multipurpose Vaginal pH-Regulator vs Nonoxynol-9 [2M],"INTRODUCTION:: 

            The multipurpose vaginal pH-regulator (MVP-R) is a water-based, petroleum-free vaginal gel which is acid-buffering and under investigation for prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. We assessed treatment adherence in a phase 3 contraceptive trial comparing the MVP-R and nonoxynol-9 (N-9) spermicidal gel. 

          
          
            METHODS:: 

            This randomized, open-label, non-inferiority study was conducted at 62 sites in the U.S. and Russia; all sites obtained IRB-approval and all subjects provided informed consent. The MVP-R (AmphoraÂ®, formerly known as Acidform) and N-9 were provided in pre-filled, single-use applicators. Women were instructed to use 1 applicator immediately before or up to 1 hour before vaginal intercourse, and to reapply product if more than 1 hour elapsed and for additional intercourse within 1 hour. Subjects recorded product use and coital activity on a daily diary. 

          
          
            RESULTS:: 

            The 3,324 enrollees included 1,665 MVP-R and 1,659 N-9 subjects. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms; characteristics of the overall Intent-to-Treat population included mean age 27.6Â±5.6 years, body mass index 27.8Â±8.0 kg/m2 (32.8% obese), 62.0% White, and 76.6% non-Hispanic. The study method was used as the only contraceptive method and used correctly in 85.6% of coital acts (85.9% MVP-R, 85.3% N-9). Overall, 61.5% of all subjects (63.0% MVP-R, 60.1% N-9) were adherent with the proper method use for â‰¥90% of coital acts. The most common reason for non-adherence was failure to reapply with additional acts of intercourse within 1 hour after application (390/2,935 [13.3%]). 

          
          
            CONCLUSION:: 

            Most subjects used these on-demand, women-controlled products as directed. Adherence was similar between the two treatment groups."

"JOHNSON, Eric G",Evaluation of a dry therapeutic urinary diet and concurrent administration of antimicrobials for struvite cystolith dissolution in dogs.,"BackgroundStruvite urolithiasis with bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) is commonly reported in dogs; few data exist to describe successful dissolution protocols in dogs with naturally occurring disease. We hypothesized that a dry therapeutic urinary diet combined with targeted antimicrobial therapy can effectively dissolve presumptive struvite cystolithiasis in dogs with naturally occurring urease-producing bacterial UTI.ResultsTen dogs with presumed infection-induced struvite cystolithiasis based on lower urinary tract signs (LUTS), radiodense cystoliths, and urease-producing bacterial UTI were enrolled. At enrollment, antimicrobials and dry therapeutic urinary diet were dispensed. In addition to lack of radiographic resolution of urolithiasis, dogs with persistent clinical signs were considered non-responders. There was no significant difference in pH between responders and non-responders; USG was significantly higher in the responder group. Recheck visits continued until radiographic dissolution or failure was documented. Five of the 10 dogs achieved radiographic dissolution of cystolithiasis within a median of 31â€‰days (range 19-103). In the other 5 dogs, surgical urolith removal was necessary due to persistent LUTS (3 dogs within 2â€‰weeks) or lack of continued dissolution noted radiographically (1 dog with numerous cystoliths failed at day 91; 1 dog failed by day 57 with questionable owner compliance).ConclusionsDissolution of urinary tract infection induced struvite cystoliths can be accomplished in some dogs fed this dry therapeutic urinary diet in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy. Case selection could increase the likelihood of successful dissolution; however, if calcium phosphate is present, this could also prevent stone dissolution. If clinical signs persist despite diet and antimicrobials, stone removal is advised."
"DEWEY, Kathryn G",Nutrient supplementation during the first 1000 days and growth of infants born to pregnant adolescents,"Few studies have evaluated the impact of nutritional supplementation among pregnant adolescents. We examined the effects of the Rang Din Nutrition Study (RDNS) interventions on children born to mothers <20 years of age. The RDNS was a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial with four arms: (1) women and children both received small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS-LNS), (2) women received iron and folic acid (IFA) and children received LNS (IFA-LNS), (3) women received IFA and children received micronutrient powder (MNP) (IFA-MNP), and (4) women received IFA and children received no supplements (IFA-Control). We enrolled 4011 women at <20 weeks gestation; 1552 were adolescents. Among adolescents, prenatal LNS reduced newborn stunting by 25% and small head size by 28% and had a marginally significant effect on newborn wasting, compared with IFA. Low birth weight and preterm birth were reduced only among adolescents with lower food security. Effects on subsequent growth status were observed only among female children in the LNS-LNS group: less stunting at 18 months (versus IFA-MNP) and lower prevalence of small head circumference and wasting at 24 months (versus IFA-Control). Initiatives targeting pregnant adolescents in similar settings should consider inclusion of small-quantity LNS, particularly for adolescents living in food-insecure households."
"STEPHENSEN, Charles B",Association of Lactase Persistence Genotypes (rs4988235) and Ethnicity with Dairy Intake in a Healthy U.S. Population.,"Lactase persistence (LP) is a trait in which lactose can be digested throughout adulthood, while lactase non-persistence (LNP) can cause lactose intolerance and influence dairy consumption. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP ID: rs4988235) is often used as a predictor for dairy intake, since it is responsible for LP in people in European descent, and can occur in other ethnic groups. The objective of this study was to determine whether rs4988235 genotypes and ethnicity influence reported dairy consumption in the United States (U.S.). A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and multiple Automated Self-Administered 24-h recalls (ASA24Â®) were used to measure habitual and recent intake, respectively, of total dairy, cheese, cow's milk, plant-based alternative milk, and yogurt in a multi-ethnic U.S. cohort genotyped for rs4988235. Within Caucasian subjects, LP individuals reported consuming more recent total dairy and habitual total cow's milk intake. For subjects of all ethnicities, LP individuals consumed more cheese (FFQ p = 0.043, ASA24 p = 0.012) and recent total dairy (ASA24 p = 0.005). For both dietary assessments, Caucasians consumed more cheese than all non-Caucasians (FFQ p = 0.036, ASA24 p = 0.002) independent of genotype, as well as more recent intake of yogurt (ASA24 p = 0.042). LP subjects consumed more total cow's milk than LNP, but only when accounting for whether subjects were Caucasian or not (FFQ p = 0.015). Fluid milk and alternative plant-based milk consumption were not associated with genotypes or ethnicity. Our results show that both LP genotype and ethnicity influence the intake of some dairy products in a multi-ethnic U.S. cohort, but the ability of rs4988235 genotypes to predict intake may depend on ethnic background, the specific dairy product, and whether intake is reported on a habitual or recent basis. Therefore, ethnicity and the dietary assessment method should also be considered when determining the suitability of rs4988235 as a proxy for dairy intake."

"REBHUN, Robert B",The effects of local irradiation on circulating lymphocytes in dogs receiving fractionated radiotherapy.,"Localized radiation therapy can be an effective treatment for cancer but is associated with localized and systemic side effects. Several studies have noted changes in complete blood count (CBC) parameters including decreases in the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and increases in the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR). These changes could reflect immunosuppression and may contribute to decreased efficacy of immunotherapies used to treat cancer. We hypothesized that dogs would demonstrate decreased ALCs during a course of radiotherapy. A retrospective study was conducted on 203 dogs receiving definitive-intent radiotherapy. Demographic information, CBC values and details of the radiotherapy protocol were collected. The mean lymphocyte count pre-treatment was 1630.68â€‰cells/Î¼L (SDâ€‰Â±â€‰667.56) with a mean NLR of 3.66 (SDâ€‰Â±â€‰4.53). The mean lymphocyte count mid-treatment was 1251.07â€‰cells/Î¼L (SDâ€‰Â±â€‰585.96) and the mean NLR was 6.23 (SDâ€‰Â±â€‰4.99). There was a significant decrease in the mean lymphocyte count by 351.41â€‰lymphocytes/Î¼L (SDâ€‰Â±â€‰592.32) between pre-treatment and mid-treatment (Pâ€‰<â€‰.0001), and a corresponding significant increase in the mean NLR of 0.93 (P = .02). Lymphopenia grade increased in 33.5% of dogs and was significant (P = .03). The ALC decrease was not correlated with the volume irradiated (P = .27), but correlated with the irradiated volume:body weight ratio (P = .03). A subset of patients (n = 35) with additional CBCs available beyond the mid-treatment time point demonstrated significant and sustained downward trends in the ALC compared with baseline. Although severe lymphopenia was rare, these decreases, especially if sustained, could impact adjuvant therapy for their cancer."
"FOX, Andrew S",Dorsal Amygdala Neurotrophin-3 Decreases Anxious Temperament in Primates,"BackgroundAn early-life anxious temperament (AT) is a risk factor for the development of anxiety, depression, and comorbid substance abuse. We validated a nonhuman primate model of early-life AT and identified the dorsal amygdala as a core component of AT's neural circuit. Here, we combine RNA sequencing, viral-vector gene manipulation, functional brain imaging, and behavioral phenotyping to uncover AT's molecular substrates.MethodsIn response to potential threat, AT and brain metabolism were assessed in 46 young rhesus monkeys. We identified AT-related transcripts using RNA-sequencing data from dorsal amygdala tissue (including central nucleus of the amygdala [Ce] and dorsal regions of the basal nucleus). Based on the results, we overexpressed the neurotrophin-3 gene, NTF3, in the dorsal amygdala using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging-guided surgery (n&nbsp;= 5 per group).ResultsThis discovery-based approach identified AT-related alterations in the expression of well-established and novel genes, including an inverse association between NTRK3 expression and AT. NTRK3 is an interesting target because it is a relatively unexplored neurotrophic factor that modulates intracellular neuroplasticity pathways. Overexpression of the transcript for NTRK3's endogenous ligand, NTF3, in the dorsal amygdala resulted in reduced AT and altered function in AT's neural circuit.ConclusionsTogether, these data implicate neurotrophin-3/NTRK3 signaling in the dorsal amygdala in mediating primate anxiety. More generally, this approach provides an important step toward understanding the molecular underpinnings of early-life AT and will be useful in guiding the development of treatments to prevent the development of stress-related psychopathology."
"NIENDAM, Tara A",Baseline psychopathology and relationship to longitudinal functional outcome in attenuated and early first episode psychosis,"BackgroundAs efforts intensify to intervene early among those at risk for psychosis, examination of the relationship between presenting psychopathology and long-term functional outcome may guide treatment decision-making and offer a means to prevent or reduce chronic disability.MethodsData were collected through the Early Detection and Intervention for the Prevention of Psychosis Program (EDIPPP), a multisite national trial testing the efficacy of an early intervention for youth at risk of developing psychosis. Participants were followed prospectively and completed comprehensive evaluations at 6, 12, and 24â€¯months, including the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) and the Global Social and Role Functioning Scales. The present analyses included 327 participants and examined the relationships between baseline symptoms and longitudinal global social and role functioning using a linear mixed modeling approach.ResultsHigher baseline negative symptoms and deteriorated thought process predicted worse social and role functioning in the follow-up period. The effect of negative symptoms on social functioning, however, was moderated by positive symptoms, and the relationship between positive symptoms and social functioning changed over time. Baseline positive symptoms, distress, and level of symptom severity were not predictors of either social or role functioning.ConclusionsBaseline negative symptoms and thought disorder appear to predict functional outcome for up to two years among adolescents and young adults at risk for psychosis. Developing effective interventions to target these symptoms may be critical to promote functional recovery among those experiencing attenuated symptoms or a first episode of psychosis."
"BOROWSKY, Alexander D",Abstract OT2-08-01: Personalized breast cancer screening in a population based study: Women Informed to Screen Depending On Measures of risk (WISDOM),"Abstract: 

               Background: WISDOM is a 100,000 healthy women preference-tolerant, pragmatic study comparing annual to personalized risk-based breast screening. The novelty of WISDOM personalized screening is the integration of previously validated genetic and clinical risk factors (age, family history, breast biopsy results, ethnicity, mammographic density) into a single risk assessment model that directs the starting age, timing, and frequency of screening. The goal of WISDOM is to determine if personalized screening, compared to annual screening, is as safe, less morbid, enables prevention, and is preferred by women. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02620852. 

               Methods: Women aged 40-74 years with no history of breast cancer or DCIS, and no previous double mastectomy can join the study online at wisdomstudy.org. Participants can elect randomization or self-select a study arm, and provide electronic consent and Release for Medical Information using DocuSign. For all participants, 5-year risk of developing breast cancer is calculated according to the Breast Cancer Screening Consortium (BCSC) model. Participants in the personalized arm undergo panel-based mutation testing, and their 5-year risk is calculated using the BCSC score combined with a Polygenic Risk Score (BCSC-PRS) that includes 75 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, increase to 229) known to increase breast cancer risk. SNPs and mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1, ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2) are assessed by saliva-based testing through Color Genomics. 5-year risk level thresholds are used to stratify for low-, moderate- and high risk. Risk stratification determines age to start, stop, and frequency of screening. 

               Enrollment: As of July 2018, the WISDOM study is open to all eligible women in California, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. To date, 23,329 eligible women have registered and 14,393 women have consented to participate in the trial. We analyzed 3,255 participants who have completed risk assessment in the personalized arm. The median age was 56 years. 82% were Caucasian, 1% African-American, and 6% Asian. 9% self-reported as Hispanic. We are partnering with health insurers and self-insured companies using coverage with evidence progression. To strengthen generalizability, we are expanding to other states. WISDOM enrollment will continue past 2019. 

               Feasibility: To evaluate the addition of PRS, we used paired statistical tests (McNemar) to compare the distributions of BCSC, and BCSC-PRS risk estimates around low-risk (<1.3%), and very-high risk (>6%) thresholds, the latter corresponding to 5-year risk of a BRCA mutation carrier. The median 5-year risk was 1.5% (IQR 1.0-2.1%) using the BCSC model, and 1.4% (IQR 0.8-2.5%) using the BCSC-PRS model. The BCSC-PRS model classified more women into the low (<1%) and very high (â‰¥6%) risk categories compared to the BCSC model (p < 0.001). 

               Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that incorporating genetic variants into a validated clinical model is feasible and impacts risk classification compared to a model without genetic risk factors. Results at 5 years will reveal if this classification improves healthcare value by reducing screen volumes and costs without jeopardizing outcomes.

Through a series of laboratory experiments with the bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, we examined whether variation in sonication frequency and acceleration is due to instrumental learning based on rewards, a fixed behavioral response to rewards, and/or a mechanical constraint. We first investigated whether bees could learn to adjust their sonication frequency in response to pollen rewards given only for specified frequency ranges and found no evidence of instrumental learning. However, we found that absence versus receipt of a pollen reward did lead to a predictable behavioral response, which depended on bee size. Finally, we found some evidence of mechanical constraints, in that flower mass affected sonication acceleration (but not frequency) through an interaction with bee size. In general, larger bees showed more flexibility in sonication frequency and acceleration, potentially reflecting a size-based constraint on the range over which smaller bees can modify frequency and acceleration. Overall, our results show that although bees did not display instrumental learning of sonication frequency, their sonication motor routine is nevertheless flexible."

"CHONDRONIKOLA, Maria",Brown adipose tissue is associated with systemic concentrations of peptides secreted from the gastrointestinal system and involved in appetite regulation,"ObjectiveBrown adipose tissue (BAT) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target against obesity and its related metabolic conditions. Data from studies in rodents support a cross talk between BAT and other distal tissues. The relation between BAT and peptide hormones secreted from the gastrointestinal system (GI) and involved in appetite regulation is not known in humans.DesignWe studied 18 men during thermoneutral conditions and mild non-shivering cold exposure (CE).Methods2-Deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans were conducted after mild cold to measure BAT volume. Fasting serum concentration of GI-secreted peptides and peptides involved in appetite regulation were measured during thermoneutral conditions and mild CE.ResultsDuring thermoneutral conditions, BAT volume was associated with lower serum concentration of leptin (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.016) and glucagon (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.048) after adjusting for age and body fat percent. CE significantly decreased serum leptin (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004) and glucagon concentration (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.020), while cold-induced BAT activation was significantly associated with lower serum ghrelin concentration (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.029).ConclusionsBAT is associated with systemic concentrations of GI-secreted peptides and peptides involved in appetite regulation, suggesting a potential cross talk between BAT and the enteropancreatic axis. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential link of BAT with the postprandial levels of appetite-regulating peptides and the putative role of BAT in appetite regulation in humans."

The measurement considers events where the two leading jets are nearly collinear (""back-to-back"") in the transverse plane and is performed for several ranges of the leading jet transverse momentum. Proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13Te and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb-1 are used. Predictions based on calculations using matrix elements at leading-order and next-to-leading-order accuracy in perturbative quantum chromodynamics supplemented with leading-log parton showers and hadronization are generally in agreement with the measurements. Discrepancies between the measurement and theoretical predictions are as large as 15%, mainly in the region 177âˆ˜<Î”Ï•12<180âˆ˜ .

"COX, Timothy",Multiparticle correlation studies in pPb collisions at sNN=8.16 TeV,"The second- and third-order azimuthal anisotropy Fourier harmonics of charged particles produced in pPb collisions, at sNN=8.16TeV, are studied over a wide range of event multiplicities. Multiparticle correlations are used to isolate global properties stemming from the collision overlap geometry. The second-order ""elliptic"" harmonic moment is obtained with high precision through four-, six-, and eight-particle correlations and, for the first time, the third-order ""triangular"" harmonic moment is studied using four-particle correlations. A sample of peripheral PbPb collisions at sNN=5.02TeV that covers a similar range of event multiplicities as the pPb results is also analyzed. Model calculations of initial-state fluctuations in pPb and PbPb collisions can be directly compared to the high-precision experimental results. This work provides new insight into the fluctuation-driven origin of the v3 coefficients in pPb and PbPb collisions, and into the dominating overall collision geometry in PbPb collisions at the earliest stages of heavy ion interactions."
"COX, Timothy",Search for Low-Mass Quark-Antiquark Resonances Produced in Association with a Photon at s=13 TeV,"A search for narrow low-mass resonances decaying to quark-antiquark pairs is presented. The search is based on proton-proton collision events collected at 13&nbsp;TeV by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9â€‰â€‰fb^{-1}, recorded in 2016. The search considers the case where the resonance has high transverse momentum due to initial-state radiation of a hard photon. To study this process, the decay products of the resonance are reconstructed as a single large-radius jet with two-pronged substructure. The signal would be identified as a localized excess in the jet invariant mass spectrum. No evidence for such a resonance is observed in the mass range 10 to 125&nbsp;GeV. Upper limits at the 95%&nbsp;confidence level are set on the coupling strength of resonances decaying to quark pairs. The results obtained with this photon trigger strategy provide the first direct constraints on quark-antiquark resonance masses below 50&nbsp;GeV obtained at a hadron collider."
"FANGUE, Nann A",Physiological consequences of rising water salinity for a declining freshwater turtle,"Sea-level rise, drought and water diversion can all lead to rapid salinization of freshwater habitats, especially in coastal areas. Increased water salinities can in turn alter the geographic distribution and ecology of freshwater species including turtles. The physiological consequences of salinization for freshwater turtles, however, are poorly known. Here, we compared the osmoregulatory response of two geographically separate populations of the freshwater Western Pond Turtle (Actinemys marmorata)-a species declining across its range in western North America-to three constant salinities: 0.4&nbsp;ppt, 10&nbsp;ppt and 15&nbsp;ppt over 2&nbsp;weeks. We found that turtles from a coastal estuarine marsh population regulated their plasma osmolality at lower levels than their conspecifics from an inland freshwater creek population 45&nbsp;km away. Plasma osmolalities were consistently lower in estuarine marsh turtles than the freshwater creek turtles over the entire 2-week exposure to 10&nbsp;ppt and 15&nbsp;ppt water. Furthermore, estuarine marsh turtles maintained plasma osmolalities within 1 SD of their mean field osmolalities over the 2-week exposure, whereas freshwater creek turtles exceeded their field values within the first few days after exposure to elevated salinities. However, individuals from both populations exhibited body mass loss in 15&nbsp;ppt water, with significantly greater loss in estuarine turtles. We speculate that the greater ability to osmoregulate by the estuarine marsh turtles may be explained by their reduced feeding and drinking in elevated salinities that was not exhibited by the freshwater creek population. However, due to mass loss in both populations, physiological and behavioural responses exhibited by estuarine marsh turtles may only be effective adaptations for short-term exposures to elevated salinities, such as those from tides and when traversing saline habitats, and are unlikely to be effective for long-term exposure to elevated salinity as is expected under sea-level rise."
"NORDAHL, Christine W",Understanding Hippocampal Development in Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder,"ObjectiveWe examined growth trajectories of hippocampal volume (HV) in early childhood in a longitudinal cohort of male and female participants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing (TD) individuals, and investigated HV in those with large brains. Relations between factors potentially associated with hippocampal size and growth were investigated.MethodParticipants received 1 to 3 structural magnetic resonance imaging scans between ages 25 and 80 months (unique participants: ASD, n&nbsp;=200; TD, n&nbsp;=110; total longitudinal scans, n&nbsp;= 593). HV growth during this period was examined using mixed-effects linear models. Associations between early HV and growth rates, and IQ and adaptive functioning, were evaluated.ResultsAfter accounting for cerebral hemisphere volume, male participants exhibited larger left and right HV than female participants. Hippocampal growth rates did not differ by sex. In children with larger hemisphere volumes, male and female participants with ASD had relatively larger HV than TD participants of similar hemisphere volume. This effect was present in a broader group than only those with disproportionate megalencephaly (male participants with large cerebral volumes relative to body size). Right hippocampi were larger than left hippocampi in both groups and sexes. Right versus left volume differences were greater for ASD. After adjusting for hemisphere volume, male participants with ASD showed a significant positive association between right hippocampal growth and adaptive behavior.ConclusionHV was relatively greater in ASD in analyses adjusting for hemisphere volume, whereas only subtle differences were observed in HV and growth between participants with ASD and TD participants in unadjusted analyses, suggesting that ASD involves atypical coupling between HV and brain size."
"CARVAJAL-CARMONA, Luis G",BRAF and TERT mutations in papillary thyroid cancer patients of Latino ancestry,"Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy in U.S. Latinas and in Colombian women. Studies in non-Latinos indicate that BRAF and TERT mutations are PTC prognostic markers. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of BRAF and TERT mutations in PTC Latino patients from Colombia. We analyzed mutations of BRAF (V600E) and TERT promoter (C228T, C250T) in tumor DNA from 141 patients (75 with classical variant PTC, CVPTC; 66 with follicular variant PTC, FVPTC) recruited through a multi-center study. Associations between mutations and clinical variables were evaluated with Fisher exact tests. Survival was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier plots. Double-mutant tumors (BRAF+/TERT+, n = 14 patients) were more common in CVPTC (P = 0.02). Relative to patients without mutations (n = 48), double mutations were more common in patients with large tumors (P = 0.03), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.01), extra-thyroid extension (P = 0.03), and advanced stage (P = 6.0 Ã— 10-5). In older patients, TERT mutations were more frequent (mean age 51 years vs 45 years for wild type TERT, P = 0.04) and survival was lower (HR = 1.20; P = 0.017); however, given the small sample size, the decrease in survival was not statically significant between genotypes. Comparisons with published data in US whites revealed that Colombian patients had a higher prevalence of severe pathological features and of double-mutant tumors (10 vs 6%, P = 0.001). Mutations in both oncogenes show prognostic associations in Latinos from Colombia. Our study is important to advance Latino PTC precision medicine and replicates previous prognostic associations between BRAF and TERT in this population."

Insertion of copper into its catalytically active subunits, including COX2, is a complex process that requires metallochaperones and redox proteins including SCO1, SCO2, and COA6, a recently discovered protein whose molecular function is unknown. To uncover the molecular mechanism by which COA6 and SCO proteins mediate copper delivery to COX2, we have solved the solution structure of COA6, which reveals a coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain typical of redox-active proteins found in the mitochondrial inter-membrane space. Accordingly, we demonstrate that COA6 can reduce the copper-coordinating disulfides of its client proteins, SCO1 and COX2, allowing for copper binding. Finally, our determination of the interaction surfaces and reduction potentials of COA6 and its client proteins provides a mechanism of how metallochaperone and disulfide reductase activities are coordinated to deliver copper to CcO."

The classical atropine/2-PAM antidote fails to protect against long-term symptoms following acute intoxication with OPs at levels that trigger status epilepticus. Acute OP intoxication also causes a robust neuroinflammatory response, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of long-term effects. In this study, we characterized the profiles of lipid mediators, important players in neuroinflammation, in the rat model of acute DFP intoxication. The profiles of lipid mediators were monitored in three different regions of the brain (cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum) at 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28â€¯days post-exposure. The distribution pattern of lipid mediators was distinct in the three brain regions. In the cerebellum, the profile is dominated by LOX metabolites, while the lipid mediator profiles in cortex and hippocampus are dominated by COX metabolites followed by LOX and CYP 450 metabolites. Following acute DFP intoxication, most of the pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (e.g., PGD2 and PGE2) increased rapidly from day 1, while the concentrations of some anti-inflammatory lipid mediators (e.g. 14,15 EpETrE) decreased after DFP intoxication but recovered by day 14 post-exposure. The lipidomics results suggest two potential treatment targets: blocking the formation of prostaglandins by inhibiting COX and stabilizing the anti-inflammatory lipid mediators containing epoxides by inhibiting the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)."

Midway through the Trump years and with a rise in nativism fervor across the globe, this expanded approach captures the creativity and variety found in the fight against racism we see the world over. Chapters focus on both the immersive global trajectories of race and racism, and the international variation in contemporary configurations of racialized experience. Race, class, and gender identities may not only be distinctive, they can extend across borders, continents, and oceans with remarkable demonstrations of solidarity happening all over the world. Palestinians, Black Panthers, Dalit, Native Americans, and Indian feminists among others meet and interact in this context. Intersections between race and such forms of power as colonialism and empire, capitalism, gender, sexuality, religion, and class are examined and compared across different national and global contexts. It is in this robust and comparative analytical approach that Global Raciality reframes conventional studies on postcolonial regimes and racial identities and expression."

A variety of feedstocks can be combined with different digestion techniques that each yields biogas with different trace compositions. California is expanding biogas production systems to help meet greenhouse gas reduction goals. Here, we report the composition of six California biogas streams from three different feedstocks (dairy manure, food waste, and municipal solid waste). The chemical and biological composition of raw biogas is reported, and the toxicity of combusted biogas is tested under fresh and photochemically aged conditions. Results show that municipal waste biogas contained elevated levels of chemicals associated with volatile chemical products such as aromatic hydrocarbons, siloxanes, and certain halogenated hydrocarbons. Food waste biogas contained elevated levels of sulfur-containing compounds including hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans, and sulfur dioxide. Biogas produced from dairy manure generally had lower concentrations of trace chemicals, but the combustion products had slightly higher toxicity response compared to the other feedstocks. Atmospheric aging performed in a photochemical smog chamber did not strongly change the toxicity (oxidative capacity or mutagenicity) of biogas combustion exhaust."
"HARRISON, Susan",Climate drives loss of phylogenetic diversity in a grassland community,"While climate change has already profoundly influenced biodiversity through local extinctions, range shifts, and altered interactions, its effects on the evolutionary history contained within sets of coexisting species-or phylogenetic community diversity-have yet to be documented. Phylogenetic community diversity may be a proxy for the diversity of functional strategies that can help sustain ecological systems in the face of disturbances. Under climatic warming, phylogenetic diversity may be especially vulnerable to decline in plant communities in warm, water-limited regions, as intensified water stress eliminates drought-intolerant species that may be relicts of past wetter climates and may be distantly related to coexisting species. Here, we document a 19-y decline of phylogenetic diversity in a grassland community as moisture became less abundant and predictable at a critical time of the year. This decline was strongest in native forbs, particularly those with high specific leaf area, a trait indicating drought sensitivity. This decline occurred at the small spatial scale where species interact, but the larger regional community has so far been buffered against loss of phylogenetic diversity by its high levels of physical and biotic heterogeneity."

While associated with better cognition among healthy adults, more education predicts faster decline in older adults with cognitive impairment. Education may influence cognitive functioning through mechanisms involving brain maintenance (BM: reduced age-related pathology) or cognitive reserve (CR: altered pathology-cognition association). We examined evidence for each mechanism by quantifying main and interaction effects of education within a well-studied pathway involving systolic blood pressure, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and episodic memory in 2 samples without dementia at the baseline (total N&nbsp;= 1136). There were no effects of education on systolic blood pressure or WMH, suggesting a lack of evidence for BM. In the sample less likely to progress to dementia, education attenuated the effect of WMH on memory at the baseline. In the sample more likely to progress to dementia, education exacerbated this effect at the baseline. These moderations provide evidence for a CR mechanism and are consistent with previous findings of faster decline once CR is depleted."
"CHANG, Celia H",Appointment completion in pediatric neurology telemedicine clinics serving underserved patients.,"BackgroundTo determine whether telemedicine improves access to outpatient neurology care for underserved patients, we compared appointment completion between urban, in-person clinics and telemedicine clinics held in rural and underserved communities where neurology consultations are provided remotely.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we identified patients scheduled for outpatient care from UCDH pediatric neurologists between January 1, 2009, and July 31, 2017, in person and by telemedicine. Demographic and clinical variables were abstracted from electronic medical records. We evaluated the association between consultation modality and visit completion in overall and matched samples using hierarchical multivariable logistic regression.ResultsWe analyzed 13,311 in-person appointments by 3,831 patients and 1,158 telemedicine appointments by 381 patients. The average travel time to the site of care was 45.8 Â± 52.1 minutes for the in-person cohort and 22.3 Â± 22.7 minutes for the telemedicine cohort. Telemedicine sites were located at an average travel time of 217.1 Â± 114.8 minutes from UCDH. Telemedicine patients were more likely to have nonprivate insurance, lower education, and lower household income. They had different diagnoses and fewer complex chronic conditions. Telemedicine visits were more likely to be completed than either ""cancelled"" or missed (""no show"") compared with in-person visits (OR 1.57, 95% CI: 1.34-1.83; OR 1.66, 95% CI: 1.31-2.10 matched on travel time to the site of care; OR 2.22, 95% CI: 1.66-2.98 matched on travel time to UCDH).ConclusionsThe use of telemedicine for outpatient pediatric neurology visits has high odds of completion and can serve as an equal adjunct to in-person clinic visits."
"BOWMAN, Lindsay C",Continuity in the neural system supporting childrenâ€™s theory of mind development: Longitudinal links between task-independent EEG and task-dependent fMRI,"Children's explicit theory of mind (ToM) understandings change over early childhood. We examined whether there is longitudinal stability in the neurobiological bases of ToM across this time period. A previous study found that source-localized resting EEG alpha attributable to the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ) was associated with children's performance on a battery of theory of mind tasks. Here, we investigated a small subset of children (Nâ€‰=â€‰12) in that original study as a preliminary investigation of whether behavioral measures of ToM performance, and/or EEG localized to the DMPFC or RTPJ predicted ToM-specific fMRI responses 3.5 years later. Results showed that preschoolers' behavioral ToM-performance positively predicted later ToM-specific fMRI responses in the DMPFC. Preschoolers' resting EEG attributable to the DMPFC also predicted later ToM-specific fMRI responses in the DMPFC. Given the small sample, results represent a first exploration and require replication. Intriguingly, they suggest that early maturation of the area of the DMPFC related to ToM reasoning is positively linked with its specific recruitment for ToM reasoning later in development, affording implications for characterizing conceptual ToM development, and its underlying neural supports."

We also strongly recommend the combined use of the VL together with a flexible intubation scope (FIS) for both asleep and awake intubation when dealing with a genuinely difficult airway. Blind intubations should no longer be performed today. When an airway has been recognized as difficult it is the safest to aim for an awake or at least a spontaneously breathing intubation if circumstances do not allow for an awake intubation. Emergency cricothyroidotomy needs to be prepared for so that it can be executed rapidly in case the attempted awake intubation leads to complete airway obstruction."

This study aimed to investigate the transcriptome-wide response of hippocampus in young mice that had been exposed to multiple sevoflurane in the neonatal period. Mice received 3% sevoflurane for 2 h on postnatal day (PND) 6, 8, and 10, followed by arterial blood gas test on PND 10, behavioral experiments on PND 31-36, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of hippocampus on PND 37. Functional annotation and protein-protein interaction analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were performed. Neonatal sevoflurane exposures induced cognitive and social behavior disorders in young mice. RNA-seq identified a total of 314 DEGs. Several enriched biological processes (ion channels, brain development, learning, and memory) and signaling pathways (oxytocin signaling pathway and glutamatergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic synapses) were highlighted. As hub-proteins, Pten was involved in nervous system development, synapse assembly, learning, memory, and behaviors, Nos3 and Pik3cd in oxytocin signaling pathway, and Cdk16 in exocytosis and phosphorylation. Some top DEGs were validated by qPCR. This study revealed a transcriptome-wide profile in mice hippocampus after multiple neonatal exposures to sevoflurane, promoting better understanding of underlying mechanisms and investigation of preventive strategies."

This may reflect an awareness of limited lifetime unique to humans, leading to a greater interest in maintaining social relationships at the expense of the non-social world in the face of limited cognitive and physical resources. Alternately, fundamental biological processes common to other primate species may direct preferential interest in social stimuli with increasing age. Inspired by a recent study that described a sustained interest in social stimuli but diminished interest in non-social stimuli in aged Barbary macaques, we carried out a conceptual replication to test whether old rhesus monkeys lost interest in non-social stimuli. Male and female macaques (Macaca mulatta; N = 243) 4-30 years old were tested with a food puzzle outfitted with an activity monitor to evaluate their propensity to manipulate the puzzle in order to free a food reward. We found no indication that aged monkeys were less interested in the puzzle than young monkeys, nor were they less able to solve it."

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate overall survival (OS). The cumulative incidences of disease-specific death, local failure, regional failure, and distant metastasis were calculated with death as a competing risk.ResultsOne hundred twenty-three patients were identified. Median follow-up for living patients was 54 months and 16 months for all patients. Ninety-one patients had salvage surgery followed by adjuvant RT. Definitive RT was utilized in the remaining 32 patients. The 5-year OS was 40%. The 5-year cumulative incidence of disease-specific death, local failure, regional failure, and distant metastasis was 55%, 34%, 22%, and 20%, respectively. Recurrent T classification and lack of salvage surgery were independently associated with worse disease-specific death and decreased OS, respectively. Subset analysis of patients who underwent salvage surgery demonstrated that age, recurrent T classification, and perineural invasion (PNI) were independently associated with decreased OS; recurrent T classification and thicker tumors were independently associated with worse disease-specific death; and positive/close margins and primary T classification were independently associated with increased local failure.ConclusionIn this group of patients with recurrent OCC, clinical outcomes were similar or improved when compared with other recurrent OCC-specific reports. In the salvage surgery subset, tumor thickness and PNI are recurrent pathologic features associated with outcomes that were only previously demonstrated in studies of primary disease. Because of the relatively worse outcomes in patients receiving definitive or adjuvant RT for recurrent OCC, we advocate for the appropriate use of postoperative RT in the initial management of oral cavity cancers."

"FIEHN, Oliver",Inborn Errors of Metabolism in the Era of Untargeted Metabolomics and Lipidomics,"Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a group of inherited diseases with variable incidences. IEMs are caused by disrupting enzyme activities in specific metabolic pathways by genetic mutations, either directly or indirectly by cofactor deficiencies, causing altered levels of compounds associated with these pathways. While IEMs may present with multiple overlapping symptoms and metabolites, early and accurate diagnosis of IEMs is critical for the long-term health of affected subjects. The prevalence of IEMs differs between countries, likely because different IEM classifications and IEM screening methods are used. Currently, newborn screening programs exclusively use targeted metabolic assays that focus on limited panels of compounds for selected IEM diseases. Such targeted approaches face the problem of false negative and false positive diagnoses that could be overcome if metabolic screening adopted analyses of a broader range of analytes. Hence, we here review the prospects of using untargeted metabolomics for IEM screening. Untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics do not rely on predefined target lists and can detect as many metabolites as possible in a sample, allowing to screen for many metabolic pathways simultaneously. Examples are given for nontargeted analyses of IEMs, and prospects and limitations of different metabolomics methods are discussed. We conclude that dedicated studies are needed to compare accuracy and robustness of targeted and untargeted methods with respect to widening the scope of IEM diagnostics."
"HASTINGS, Paul D",Direct replication of taskâ€dependent neural activation patterns during sadness introspection in two independent adolescent samples,"Functional neuroimaging results need to replicate to inform sound models of human social cognition and its neural correlates. Introspection, the capacity to reflect on one's thoughts and feelings, is one process required for normative social cognition and emotional functioning. Engaging in introspection draws on a network of brain regions including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), middle temporal gyri (MTG), and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Maturation of these regions during adolescence mirrors the behavioral advances seen in adolescent social cognition, but the neural correlates of introspection in adolescence need to replicate to confirm their generalizability and role as a possible mechanism. The current study investigated whether reflecting upon one's own feelings of sadness would activate and replicate similar brain regions in two independent samples of adolescents. Participants included 156 adolescents (50% female) from the California Families Project and 119 adolescent girls from the Pittsburgh Girls Study of Emotion. All participants completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while completing the same facial emotion-processing task at age 16-17â€‰years. Both samples showed similar whole-brain activation patterns when engaged in sadness introspection and when judging a nonemotional facial feature. Whole-brain activation was unrelated to ERQ scores in both samples. Neural responsivity to task manipulations replicated in regions recruited for socio-emotional (mPFC, PCC, MTG, TPJ) and attention (dorsolateral PFC, precentral gyri, superior occipital gyrus, superior parietal lobule) processing. These findings demonstrate robust replication of neural engagement during sadness introspection in two independent adolescent samples."

"OTEIZA DE FRAGA, Patricia I",(-)-Epicatechin and NADPH oxidase inhibitors prevent bile acid-induced Caco-2 monolayer permeabilization through ERK1/2 modulation,"Secondary bile acids promote gastrointestinal (GI) tract permeabilization both in vivo and in vitro. Consumption of high fat diets increases bile acid levels in the GI tract which can contribute to intestinal permeabilization and consequent local and systemic inflammation. This work investigated the mechanisms involved in bile acid (deoxycholic acid (DCA))-induced intestinal epithelial cell monolayer permeabilization and the preventive capacity of (-)-epicatechin (EC). While EC prevented high fat diet-induced intestinal permeabilization in mice, it did not mitigate the associated increase in fecal/cecal total and individual bile acids. In vitro, using differentiated Caco-2â€¯cells as a model of epithelial barrier, EC and other NADPH oxidase inhibitors (VAS-2870 and apocynin) mitigated DCA-induced Caco-2 monolayer permeabilization. While EC inhibited DCA-mediated increase in cell oxidants, it did not prevent DCA-induced mitochondrial oxidant production. Prevention of DCA-induced ERK1/2 activation with EC, VAS-2870, apocynin and the MEK inhibitor U0126, also prevented monolayer permeabilization, stressing the key involvement of ERK1/2 in this process and its redox regulation. Downstream, DCA promoted myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation which was related to MLC phosphatase (MLCP) inhibition by ERK1/2. DCA also decreased the levels of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin, which can be related to MMP-2 activation and consequent ZO-1 and occludin degradation. Both events were prevented by EC, NADPH oxidase and ERK1/2 inhibitors. Thus, DCA-induced Caco-2 monolayer permeabilization occurs mainly secondary to a redox-regulated ERK1/2 activation and downstream disruption of TJ structure and dynamic. EC's capacity to mitigate in vivo the gastrointestinal permeabilization caused by consumption of high-fat diets can be in part related to its capacity to inhibit bile-induced NADPH oxidase and ERK1/2 activation."
"GEE, Kevin A",Maltreatment Profiles of Child Welfareâ€“Involved Children in Special Education: Classification and Behavioral Consequences,"In this study, I investigated the maltreatment profiles of child welfareâ€“involved children in special education and examined how those profiles influenced their internalizing and externalizing behaviors. I analyzed data on a sample of 290 children (63% male, 37% female, Mage = 11 years) from the National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being II. When weighted, this sample represented approximately 233,000 children involved in the child welfare system and in special education. Results from latent class analyses revealed four maltreatment classes, listed by predominance: supervisory neglect, physical abuse, other forms of maltreatment, and sexual abuse. Relative to children in the sexual abuse class, children had higher teacher-reported internalizing problem behaviors if their predominate maltreatment class was either supervisory neglect or physical abuse. Understanding maltreatment and its consequences for child welfareâ€“involved children in special education can help better inform ways to promote their educational success."

RapidEye's Tasseled Cap Feature Yellowness (YEL) corresponds to the reflectance characteristics of senescent crops, with relatively higher reflectance in the visible portion of the spectrum due to chlorophyll breakdown, and lower reflectance in the NIR range due to cell structure decomposition. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential and accuracy of YEL, in comparison to the Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI), for estimating chlorophyll and nitrogen concentration of senescent winter and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Preliminary results showed that YEL had a higher potential to estimate Chl in senescent winter wheat in comparison to PSRI, while PSRI demonstrated stronger correlations to Chl in senescent spring wheat than YEL. For the estimation of N concentration, YEL yielded much stronger, statistically significant correlations and a higher accuracy than PSRI. Results indicated the capability of YEL to predict both Chl and N concentration, probably attributable to the additional information provided by the Red-edge band. YEL may be used to characterize in-field senescence status variations, potentially providing ancillary information for the assignment of precision management zones related to yield and wheat quality parameters."

To demonstrate this, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline, FASER (Food Authentication from SEquencing Reads), designed to resolve the relative composition of mixtures of eukaryotic species using RNA or DNA sequencing. Our comprehensive database includes >6000 plants and animals that may be present in food. FASER accurately identified eukaryotic species with 0.4% median absolute difference between observed and expected proportions on sequence data from various sources including sausage meat, plants, and fish. FASER was applied to 31 high protein powder raw factory ingredient total RNA samples. The samples mostly contained the expected source ingredient, chicken, while three samples unexpectedly contained pork and beef. Our results demonstrate that DNA/RNA sequencing of food ingredients, combined with a robust analysis, can be used to find contaminants and authenticate food ingredients in a single assay."

Fifty-six crossbred pigs (approximately 32.99 kg body weight) were assigned to one of two treatments with seven replicate pens and four pigs per pen. Pigs were fed with control (corn-soybean meal diets) or food waste from d 0 to 53, while all pigs were fed with the control diet from d 53 to 79. The 16S rRNA sequencing was used to analyze microbiota of feces collected on d 0, 28, 53, and 79. Meat quality and carcass characteristics were measured in one pig per pen at the end of the experiment. Pigs fed with food waste contained more (p < 0.05) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in back-fat. Feeding food waste increased (p < 0.05) the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, but decreased (p < 0.05) the relative abundances of Streptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae in feces on d 29 or d 53. In conclusion, feeding enzymatically digested food waste did not affect pork quality, but provided more beneficial fatty acids to pork consumers and altered the fecal microbiota in growing-finishing pigs."

"WANG, Jane-Ling",FMEM: Functional Mixed Effects Models for Longitudinal Functional Responses.,The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic and theoretical analysis of estimation and inference for a class of functional mixed effects models (FMEM). Such FMEMs consist of fixed effects that characterize the association between longitudinal functional responses and covariates of interest and random effects that capture the spatial-temporal correlations of longitudinal functional responses. We propose local linear estimates of refined fixed effect functions and establish their weak convergence along with a simultaneous confidence band for each fixed-effect function. We propose a global test for the linear hypotheses of varying coefficient functions and derive the associated asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis and the asymptotic power under the alternative hypothesis are derived. We also establish the convergence rates of the estimated spatial-temporal covariance operators and their associated eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We conduct extensive simulations and apply our method to a white-matter fiber data set from a national database for autism research to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimation and inference procedures.
"ROMANO, Patrick",Postoperative respiratory failure: An update on the validity of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Patient Safety Indicator 11 in an era of clinical documentation improvement programs.,"BACKGROUND: Administrative data can be used to identify cases of postoperative respiratory failure (PRF). We aimed to determine if recent changes to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Patient Safety Indicator 11 (PSI 11) and adoption of clinical documentation improvement programs have improved the validity of PSI 11. We also analyzed reasons why PSI 11 was falsely triggered. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of all eligible discharges using health record data from five academic medical centers between October 1, 2012 and September 30, 2015. RESULTS: Of 437 flagged records, 434 (99.3%) were accurately coded and 414 (94.7%) represented true clinical PRF. None of the false positive records involved respiratory failure present on admission. Most (78.3%) false positive records required airway protection but did not have respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: The validity of PSI 11 has improved with recent changes to the code criterion and adoption of clinical documentation improvement programs."

These cofactors are expensive to use in vitro and difficult to control in vivo. We demonstrate the development of a noncanonical redox cofactor system based on nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN+). The key enzyme in the system is a computationally designed glucose dehydrogenase with a 107-fold cofactor specificity switch toward NMN+ over NADP+ based on apparent enzymatic activity. We demonstrate that this system can be used to support diverse redox chemistries in vitro with high total turnover number (~39,000), to channel reducing power in Escherichia coli whole cells specifically from glucose to a pharmaceutical intermediate, levodione, and to sustain the high metabolic flux required for the central carbon metabolism to support growth. Overall, this work demonstrates efficient use of a noncanonical cofactor in biocatalysis and metabolic pathway design."

Research has largely treated the learning problem as one of identifying perceptual similarities among exemplars (typically posed, stereotyped facial configurations). However, recent meta-analyses and reviews converge to suggest that emotion categories are abstract, involving high-dimensional and situationally variable instances. In this paper we consult research on the development of abstract object categorization to guide hypotheses about how infants might learn abstract emotion categories because the two domains present infants with similar learning challenges. In particular, we consider how a developmental cascades framework offers opportunities to understand how and when young children develop emotion categories."

"SILVERMAN, Jill L",mGluR5 Modulation of Behavioral and Epileptic Phenotypes in a Mouse Model of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex,"Drugs targeting metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) have therapeutic potential in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The question whether inhibition or potentiation of mGluR5 could be beneficial depends, among other factors, on the specific indication. To facilitate the development of mGluR5 treatment strategies, we tested the therapeutic utility of mGluR5 negative and positive allosteric modulators (an mGluR5 NAM and PAM) for TSC, using a mutant mouse model with neuronal loss of Tsc2 that demonstrates disease-related phenotypes, including behavioral symptoms of ASD and epilepsy. This model uniquely enables the in vivo characterization and rescue of the electrographic seizures associated with TSC. We demonstrate that inhibition of mGluR5 corrects hyperactivity, seizures, and elevated de novo synaptic protein synthesis. Conversely, positive allosteric modulation of mGluR5 results in the exacerbation of hyperactivity and epileptic phenotypes. The data suggest a meaningful therapeutic potential for mGluR5 NAMs in TSC, which warrants clinical exploration and the continued development of mGluR5 therapies."

In terms of global root-mean-squared error metrics, this high-resolution simulation is generally superior to results from the low-resolution configuration of E3SMv1 (due to resolution, tuning changes, and possibly initialization procedure) and compares favorably to models in the CMIP5 ensemble. Ocean and sea ice simulation is particularly improved, due to better resolution of bathymetry, the ability to capture more variability and extremes in winds and currents, and the ability to resolve mesoscale ocean eddies. The largest improvement in this regard is an ice-free Labrador Sea, which is a major problem at low resolution. Interestingly, several features found to improve with resolution in previous studies are insensitive to resolution or even degrade in E3SMv1. Most notable in this regard are warm bias and associated stratocumulus deficiency in eastern subtropical oceans and lack of improvement in El NiÃ±o. Another major finding of this study is that resolution increase had negligible impact on climate sensitivity (measured by net feedback determined through uniform +4K prescribed sea surface temperature increase) and aerosol sensitivity. Cloud response to resolution increase consisted of very minor decrease at all levels. Large-scale patterns of precipitation bias were also relatively unaffected by grid spacing."

"SOLOMON, Marjorie",A diffusion-weighted imaging tract-based spatial statistics study of autism spectrum disorder in preschool-aged children,"BackgroundThe core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are widely theorized to result from altered brain connectivity. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) has been a versatile method for investigating underlying microstructural properties of white matter (WM) in ASD. Despite phenotypic and etiological heterogeneity, DWI studies in majority male samples of older children, adolescents, and adults with ASD have largely reported findings of decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) across several commissural, projection, and association fiber tracts. However, studies in preschool-aged children (i.e., <â€‰30-40â€‰months) suggest individuals with ASD have increased measures of WM FA earlier in development.MethodsWe analyzed 127 individuals with ASD (85â™‚, 42â™€) and 54 typically developing (TD) controls (42â™‚, 26â™€), aged 25.1-49.6â€‰months. Voxel-wise effects of ASD diagnosis, sex, age, and their interaction on DWI measures of FA, mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were investigated using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) while controlling mean absolute and relative motion.ResultsCompared to TD controls, males and females with ASD had significantly increased measures of FA in eight clusters (threshold-free cluster enhancement p < 0.05) that incorporated several WM tracts including regions of the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum, inferior frontal-occipital fasciculi, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, and corticospinal tract. A diagnosis by sex interaction was observed in measures of AD across six significant clusters incorporating areas of the body, genu, and splenium of the corpus collosum. In these tracts, females with ASD showed increased AD compared to TD females, while males with ASD showed decreased AD compared to TD males.ConclusionsThe current findings support growing evidence that preschool-aged children with ASD have atypical measures of WM microstructure that appear to differ in directionality from alterations observed in older individuals with the condition. To our knowledge, this study represents the largest sample of preschool-aged females with ASD to be evaluated using DWI. Microstructural differences associated with ASD largely overlapped between sexes. However, differential relationships of AD measures indicate that sex likely modulates ASD neuroanatomical phenotypes. Further longitudinal study is needed to confirm and quantify the developmental relationship of WM structure in ASD."

Efficient and scalable enzymatic syntheses of these structures have proven challenging due to the lack of access to a highly active Î²1â€’3-galactosyltransferase (Î²3GalT) in large amounts. Previously reported E. coli Î²3GalT (EcWbgO) has been identified as a limiting factor for producing a Î²1-3-galactose-terminated human milk oligosaccharide lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) by fermentation. Here we report the identification of an EcWbgO homolog from C. violaceum (CvÎ²3GalT) which showed a high efficiency in catalyzing the formation of LNT from lacto-N-triose (LNT II). With the highly active CvÎ²3GalT, multigram-scale (>10 gram) synthesis of LNT from lactose was achieved using a sequential one-pot multienzyme (OPME) glycosylation process. The access to CvÎ²3GalT enabled enzymatic synthesis of several fucosylated HMOSs with or without further sialylation including LNFP II, S-LNF II, LNDFH I, LNFP V, and DiFuc-LNT. Among these, LNFP V and DiFuc-LNT would not be accessible by enzymatic synthesis if an active Î²3GalT were not available."
"CARTER, Cameron S",Delay discounting abnormalities are seen in first-episode schizophrenia but not in bipolar disorder,"Delay discounting (DD) is the phenomenon of individuals discounting future rewards as a function of time. It has been studied extensively in chronic schizophrenia (SZ) and the results of these studies have been variable. Comorbidity in chronic samples could be one reason for the mixed findings and studies in first-episode (FE) samples are surprisingly lacking. Bipolar disorder (BP) which shares some genetic and symptom features with SZ could serve as an interesting comparison group for DD but has been underexplored. Here we present the first study that combines FE SZ, FE BP with psychotic features, as well as healthy controls and study DD with two versions of the task. We found that SZ showed steeper discounting than HC and BP on the well-validated Kirby DD task. SZ showed no difference than HC on a separate DD task with smaller rewards presented with decimal places and shorter delays. As a preliminary finding, DD was found to be positively related to positive symptoms in FE SZ, while no relationship was found between negative symptoms and DD. In addition, we found comparable DD in BP compared to HC. Ultimately, our data may help elucidate the psychopathology in SZ and BP during intertemporal decision making."

We performed genome-wide association studies of frontal, occipital, parietal and temporal lobe volumes in 16,016 individuals, and replicated our findings in 8,789 individuals. We identified six genetic loci associated with specific lobar volumes independent of intracranial volume. Two loci, associated with occipital (6q22.32) and temporal lobe volume (12q14.3), were previously reported to associate with intracranial and hippocampal volume, respectively. We identified four loci previously unknown to affect brain volumes: 3q24 for parietal lobe volume, and 1q22, 4p16.3 and 14q23.1 for occipital lobe volume. The associated variants were located in regions enriched for histone modifications (DAAM1 and THBS3), or close to genes causing Mendelian brain-related diseases (ZIC4 and FGFRL1). No genetic overlap between lobar volumes and neurological or psychiatric diseases was observed. Our findings reveal part of the complex genetics underlying brain development and suggest a role for regulatory regions in determining brain volumes."

A plethora of photo-z PDF estimation methodologies abound, producing discrepant results with no consensus on a preferred approach. We present the results of a comprehensive experiment comparing 12 photo-z algorithms applied to mock data produced for The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time Dark Energy Science Collaboration. By supplying perfect prior information, in the form of the complete template library and a representative training set as inputs to each code, we demonstrate the impact of the assumptions underlying each technique on the output photo-z PDFs. In the absence of a notion of true, unbiased photo-z PDFs, we evaluate and interpret multiple metrics of the ensemble properties of the derived photo-z PDFs as well as traditional reductions to photo-z point estimates. We report systematic biases and overall over/underbreadth of the photo-z PDFs of many popular codes, which may indicate avenues for improvement in the algorithms or implementations. Furthermore, we raise attention to the limitations of established metrics for assessing photo-z PDF accuracy; though we identify the conditional density estimate loss as a promising metric of photo-z PDF performance in the case where true redshifts are available but true photo-z PDFs are not, we emphasize the need for science-specific performance metrics."

However, less evaluated are newly emerging indicators of soil health. Furthermore, as soil spectral libraries expand in size, commonly employed linear models such as partial least squares regression (PLSR) may be challenged by the number and diversity of spectra. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are an emerging deep learning approach that can offer advantages in quantification of soil properties by utilizing non-linear relationships among spectra and soil components. We compared ANN versus PLSR models for predicting an increasingly used soil health indicator, permanganate oxidizable C (POXC), as well as more routinely predicted soil variables (e.g., clay, soil organic C [SOC]), across a gradient of soil organic matter furnished by a deforestation chronosequence in Kenya (n = 144). Candidate ANN architectures were first methodologically evaluated and described to identify best-practices for the application of ANN to soil spectroscopy. Predictions by the resulting ANN relative to PLSR were similar or slightly improved for routinely measured variables that represent soil organic matter (SOC, C:N) and physical properties (clay, silt, sand, bulk density). The accuracy of POXC predictions were similar for ANN (RMSE 102 mg kgâˆ’1) and PLSR (RMSE 106 mg kgâˆ’1). However, models drew on shared but also distinct wavenumbers, indicating differential use of information in soil infrared spectra by non-linear versus linear chemometric models. Even in relatively small spectral datasets of similar soil types expected to favor PLSR, ANN shows comparable predictive performance. To help guide future applications of ANN in soil spectroscopy, we propose a systematic procedure to select ANN model hyperparameters."

Binding of Î±-actinin to the IQ motif of CaV 1.2 supports its surface localization and postsynaptic targeting in neurons. We report a bi-functional mechanism that restricts CaV 1.2 activity to its target sites. We solved separate NMR structures of the IQ motif (residues 1,646-1,664) bound to Î±-actinin-1 and to apo-calmodulin (apoCaM). The CaV 1.2 K1647A and Y1649A mutations, which impair Î±-actinin-1 but not apoCaM binding, but not the F1658A and K1662E mutations, which impair apoCaM but not Î±-actinin-1 binding, decreased single-channel open probability, gating charge movement, and its coupling to channel opening. Thus, Î±-actinin recruits CaV 1.2 to defined surface regions and simultaneously boosts its open probability so that CaV 1.2 is mostly active when appropriately localized."

While pathogen populations residing on the surface of ready-to-eat produce can be potentially removed through thorough washing, there is no disinfection technology available that effectively eliminates internal bacterial populations. By screening 303 multi-gene deletion (MGD) mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) 14028s, we were able to identify ten genomic regions that play a role in opening the stomatal pore of lettuce leaves. The major metabolic functions of the deleted regions are associated with sensing the environment, bacterium movement, transport through the bacterial membrane, and biosynthesis of surface appendages. Interestingly, at 21 days post inoculation, seven of these mutants showed increased population titers inside the leaf, two mutants showed similar titers as the wild type bacterium, whereas one mutant with a large deletion that includes the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) showed significantly impaired persistence in the leaf apoplast. These findings suggest that not all the genomic regions required for initiation of leaf colonization (i.e., epiphytic behavior and tissue penetration) are essential for continuing bacterial survival as an endophyte. We also observed that mutants lacking either SPI-1 (Mut3) or SPI-2 (Mut9) induce callose deposition levels comparable to those of the wild type STm 14028s; therefore, these islands do not seem to affect this lettuce defense mechanism. However, the growth of Mut9, but not Mut3, was significantly impaired in the leaf apoplastic wash fluid (AWF) suggesting that the STm persistence in the apoplast may be linked to nutrient acquisition capabilities or overall bacterial fitness in this niche, which are dependent on the gene(s) deleted in the Mut9 strain. The genetic basis of STm colonization of leaves investigated in this study provides a foundation from which to develop mitigation tactics to enhance food safety."

"CHEN, Moon S",Engaging diverse populations about biospecimen donation for cancer research,"Clinical research increasingly relies upon the availability of appropriate genetic materials; however, the proportion of biospecimens from racial/ethnic minority patients and healthy controls are underrepresented, which preclude equitable research across all patient groups for cancer treatment. National Cancer Institute-funded Community Network Program Centers in California, Florida, and New York collaborated with local community partners to conduct three independent formative research studies with diverse (African American, Asian American, Hispanic, and White) participants to explore their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about biobanking, and their experiences with the donation of biospecimens. Our findings demonstrated similarities in overall low knowledge and understanding about the use of biospecimens for research. This was exacerbated for non-English speakers. Racial and ethnic groups differed with regard to a number of factors that are obstacles for participation, e.g., continuing medical mistrust (African Americans), lack of benefit (Hispanics), apprehension about the physical toll of donating (Vietnamese), usage of biospecimen for research (Hmong and Chinese), and suspicion of exploitation by corporate entities (Whites). However, participants uniformly reported general interest and willingness to participate in biobanking for altruistic purposes, particularly to benefit future generations. This interest was framed with a strong admonition that donations should be accompanied by transparency about study sponsorship and ownership, distribution and use of biospecimens, and study information that fit participants' backgrounds and experiences. This cross-cultural regional analysis offers significant insights into the similarities and variations in opinions and perceptions about biobanking and the collection of biospecimens for use in cancer research."
"MILLER, Lisa A",Inhibition of allergenâ€induced dermal eosinophilia by an oxoeicosanoid receptor antagonist in nonâ€human primates,"Background and purpose5-Oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE), acting via the OXE receptor, is unique among 5-lipoxygenase products in its ability to directly induce human eosinophil migration, suggesting its involvement in eosinophilic diseases. To address this hypothesis, we synthesized selective indole-based OXE receptor antagonists. Because rodents lack an OXE receptor orthologue, we sought to determine whether these antagonists could attenuate allergen-induced skin eosinophilia in sensitized monkeys.Experimental approachIn a pilot study, cynomolgus monkeys with environmentally acquired sensitivity to Ascaris suum were treated orally with the ""first-generation"" OXE antagonist 230 prior to intradermal injection of 5-oxo-ETE or Ascaris extract. Eosinophils were evaluated in punch biopsy samples taken 6 or 24&nbsp;hr later. We subsequently treated captive-bred rhesus monkeys sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) allergen with a more recently developed OXE antagonist, S-Y048, and evaluated its effects on dermal eosinophilia induced by either 5-oxo-ETE or HDM.Key resultsIn a pilot experiment, both 5-oxo-ETE and Ascaris extract induced dermal eosinophilia in cynomolgus monkeys, which appeared to be reduced by 230. Subsequently, we found that the related OXE antagonist S-Y048 is a highly potent inhibitor of 5-oxo-ETE-induced activation of rhesus monkey eosinophils in vitro and has a half-life in plasma of about 6&nbsp;hr after oral administration. S-Y048 significantly inhibited eosinophil infiltration into the skin in response to both intradermally administered 5-oxo-ETE and HDM.Conclusions and implications5-Oxo-ETE may play an important role in allergen-induced eosinophilia. Blocking its effects with S-Y048 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for eosinophilic diseases."

"CHENG, R Holland H",Structure of human rhinovirus complexed with Fab fragments from a neutralizing antibody.,"We have determined the structure of a human rhinovirus (HRV)-Fab complex by using cryoelectron microscopy and image reconstruction techniques. This is the first view of an intact human virus complexed with a monoclonal Fab (Fab17-IA) for which both atomic structures are known. The surface area on HRV type 14 (HRV14) in contact with Fab17-IA was approximately 500 A2 (5 nm2), which is much larger than the area that constitutes the NIm-IA epitope (on viral protein VP1) defined by natural escape mutants. From modeling studies and electrostatic potential calculations, charged residues outside the neutralizing immunogenic site IA (NIm-IA) were also predicted to be involved in antibody recognition. These predictions were confirmed by site-specific mutations and analysis of the Fab17-IA-HRV14 complex, along with knowledge of the crystallographic structures of HRV14 and Fab17-IA. The bound Fab17-IA reaches across a surface depression (the canyon) and meets a related Fab at the nearest icosahedral twofold axis. By adjusting the elbow angles of the bound Fab fragments from 162 degrees to 198 degrees, an intact antibody molecule can be easily modeled. This, along with aggregation and binding stoichiometry results, supports the earlier proposal that this antibody binds bivalently to the surface of HRV14 across icosahedral twofold axes. One prediction of this model, that the intact canyon-spanning immunoglobulin G molecule would block attachment of the virus to HeLa cells, was confirmed experimentally."
"KEEGAN, Theresa H",Cancer-related information needs and cancers impact on control over life influence health-related quality of life among adolescents and young adults with cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) diagnosed with cancer between 15 and 39 years of age often report need for greater amounts of cancer-related information and perceive that cancer has had a negative impact on control over their life. We examined whether unmet information need and perceived control over life are associated with health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: We examined data from 484 AYA cancer survivors recruited from population-based cancer registries in 2007-2008. Participants completed surveys a median of 11 months after diagnosis. Multivariable linear regression analyses estimated associations of unmet cancer-related information needs and impact of cancer on control over life on HRQOL (SF-12). RESULTS: Two-thirds of AYAs reported an intermediate or high level of unmet information need, and half (47%) reported a negative impact of cancer on control. Greater unmet information need was associated with lower overall mental and physical HRQOL and lower levels of all HRQOL subscales except vitality. A negative impact on control over life was associated with lower overall mental HRQOL as well as lower HRQOL across all subscales except general health perceptions (all p <0.05). In multivariable analyses, perceived control and unmet information need were independently associated with HRQOL (p-values for interaction >0.1). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent and young adult patients with cancer have high levels of unmet cancer-related information needs and perceived negative impact of cancer on control over life; both were independently associated with lower HRQOL. Addressing unmet information needs among AYA cancer survivors and finding ways to increase their sense of control may help improve HRQOL in this understudied population."
"GLASER, Nicole",Distinguishing Type 2 Diabetes from Type 1 Diabetes in African American and Hispanic American Pediatric Patients,"ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that clinical observations made at patient presentation can distinguish type 2 diabetes (T2D) from type 1 diabetes (T1D) in pediatric patients aged 2 to 18.Subjects and methodsMedical records of 227 African American and 112 Hispanic American pediatric patients diagnosed as T1D or T2D were examined to compare parameters in the two diseases. Age at presentation, BMI z-score, and gender were the variables used in logistic regression analysis to create models for T2D prediction.ResultsThe regression-based model created from African American data had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 89%; testing of a replication cohort showed 91% sensitivity and 93% specificity. A model based on the Hispanic American data showed 92% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Similarities between African American and Hispanic American patients include: (1) age at onset for both T1D and T2D decreased from the 1980s to the 2000s; (2) risk of T2D increased markedly with obesity. Racial/ethnic-specific observations included: (1) in African American patients, the proportion of females was significantly higher than that of males for T2D compared to T1D (p<0.0001); (2) in Hispanic Americans, the level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was significantly higher in T1D than in T2D (p<0.002) at presentation; (3) the strongest contributor to T2D risk was female gender in African Americans, while the strongest contributor to T2D risk was BMI z-score in Hispanic Americans.ConclusionsDistinction of T2D from T1D at patient presentation was possible with good sensitivity and specificity using only three easily-assessed variables: age, gender, and BMI z-score. In African American pediatric diabetes patients, gender was the strongest predictor of T2D, while in Hispanic patients, BMI z-score was the strongest predictor. This suggests that race/ethnic specific models may be useful to optimize distinction of T1D from T2D at presentation."

"BEN-SHALOM, Roy",Alternative splicing potentiates dysfunction of early-onset epileptic encephalopathy SCN2A variants,"Epileptic encephalopathies are severe forms of infantile-onset epilepsy often complicated by severe neurodevelopmental impairments. Some forms of early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE) have been associated with variants in SCN2A, which encodes the brain voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2. Many voltage-gated sodium channel genes, including SCN2A, undergo developmentally regulated mRNA splicing. The early onset of these disorders suggests that developmentally regulated alternative splicing of NaV1.2 may be an important consideration when elucidating the pathophysiological consequences of epilepsy-associated variants. We hypothesized that EOEE-associated NaV1.2 variants would exhibit greater dysfunction in a splice isoform that is prominently expressed during early development. We engineered five EOEE-associated NaV1.2 variants (T236S, E999K, S1336Y, T1623N, and R1882Q) into the adult and neonatal splice isoforms of NaV1.2 and performed whole-cell voltage clamp to elucidate their functional properties. All variants exhibited functional defects that could enhance neuronal excitability. Three of the five variants (T236S, E999K, and S1336Y) exhibited greater dysfunction in the neonatal isoform compared with those observed in the adult isoform. Computational modeling of a developing cortical pyramidal neuron indicated that T236S, E999K, S1336Y, and R1882Q showed hyperexcitability preferentially in immature neurons. These results suggest that both splice isoform and neuronal developmental stage influence how EOEE-associated NaV1.2 variants affect neuronal excitability."

"GRIMSRUD, Kristin N",Hypoglycemia after Bariatric Surgery in Mice and Optimal Dosage and Efficacy of Glucose Supplementation.,"The Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) mouse model is a vital tool for studying the pathophysiology of bariatric surgery and contributes greatly to research on obesity and diabetes. However, complications including postsurgical hypoglycemia can have profoundly negative effects. Unlike in humans, blood glucose (BG) is not typically managed in postoperative rodents, despite their critical role as translational models; without this management, rodents can experience hypoglycemia, potentially impairing wound healing, decreasing survivability, complicating interpretation of research data, and limiting translational utility. In this project, we sought to identify an optimal method for minimally invasive administration of dextrose in C57BL/6N (n = 16; 8 male, 8 female) mice. To do so, we characterized BG pharmacokinetic profiles after subcutaneous and oral-transmucosal (OTM) administration of dextrose. Compared with OTM dosage, the subcutaneous route provided more consistent and reliable delivery of glucose and did not cause significant adverse reactions. We then evaluated the frequency of hypoglycemic events after RYGB in C57BL/6N mice (n = 16; 8 male, 8 female) and the effects of subcutaneous dextrose supplementation on morbidity and mortality. BG measurement and behavioral pain assessment (grimace test) were performed for 3 d after surgery. Hypoglycemic (BG â‰¤ 60 mg/dL) animals were assigned to dose (5% dextrose SC) or no-dose treatment groups. Nearly all (87%) mice became hypoglycemic; 2 of these mice died. No significant intergroup difference in grimace score or mortality was detected. Overall, our results demonstrate that hypoglycemia is a frequent adverse event after RYGB in mice and that subcutaneous injection of dextrose is a safe and effective way to manage hypoglycemia. Further studies are necessary to optimize the intervention threshold and optimal dosage; regardless, we recommend glycemic management after RYGB surgery in mice."

The changing climate is altering species distributions with consequences for population dynamics, resulting in winners and losers in the Anthropocene. 2. Agraulis vanillae, the gulf fritillary butterfly, has expanded its range in the past 100 years in the western U.S.A. Time series analysis is combined with species distribution modelling to investigate factors limiting the distribution of A. vanillae and to predict future shifts under warming scenarios. 3. Time series analyses from the western U.S.A. show that urban development has a positive association with year of colonisation (the host plant Passiflora is an ornamental in gardens). Colonisation was also associated positively and to a lesser extent with winter maximum temperatures, whereas a negative impact of minimum temperatures and precipitation was apparent on population growth rates after establishment. 4. Species distribution models vary by region. In the eastern U.S.A., the butterfly is primarily limited by minimum temperatures in the winter and host availability later in the season. Eastern U.S. projected expansion broadly follows the expectation of poleward distributional shifts, especially for the butterfly's maximum annual extent. Western U.S. distributions are limited by the host plant, which in turn is dependent on urban centres. Projected western U.S. expansion is not limited to a single direction and is driven by urban centres becoming more suitable for the host plant. 5. These results demonstrate the value of combining time series with spatial modelling, at the same time as incorporating biotic interactions, aiming to understand and predict shifting geographical ranges in the Anthropocene."
"DECARLI, Charles",Functional brain architecture is associated with the rate of tau accumulation in Alzheimerâ€™s disease,"In Alzheimer's diseases (AD), tau pathology is strongly associated with cognitive decline. Preclinical evidence suggests that tau spreads across connected neurons in an activity-dependent manner. Supporting this, cross-sectional AD studies show that tau deposition patterns resemble functional brain networks. However, whether higher functional connectivity is associated with higher rates of tau accumulation is unclear. Here, we combine resting-state fMRI with longitudinal tau-PET in two independent samples including 53 (ADNI) and 41 (BioFINDER) amyloid-biomarker defined AD subjects and 28 (ADNI) vs. 16 (BioFINDER) amyloid-negative healthy controls. In both samples, AD subjects show faster tau accumulation than controls. Second, in AD, higher fMRI-assessed connectivity between 400 regions of interest (ROIs) is associated with correlated tau-PET accumulation in corresponding ROIs. Third, we show that a model including baseline connectivity and tau-PET is associated with future tau-PET accumulation. Together, connectivity is associated with tau spread in AD, supporting the view of transneuronal tau propagation."

Many parameters affect cell attachment behavior, including surface roughness and other topographical features. An understanding of these relationships is critical in the light of recent outbreaks caused by foodborne bacteria. Postharvest packing lines have been identified as a potential source of cross-contamination with pathogens, which can cause subsequent foodborne illness. The objective of this article is to evaluate the influence of surface topographical features on bacterial attachment at various processing temperatures to determine the extent of bacterial colonization. Type 304 stainless steel surfaces and pathogenic Listeria monocytogenes Scott A were used for a detailed investigation. Two commonly used surface types, extruded and ground, were evaluated to determine differences in bacterial attachment on the same type of material. Fifteen surface topography parameters at three processing temperatures were studied to evaluate possible correlations with microbial attachment on these surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy were used for both qualitative and quantitative analyses of surfaces. An analysis of variance and multivariate regression analysis were used to predict the attachment behavior of L. monocytogenes Scott A on stainless steel surfaces. Surface isotropy, average surface roughness, surface spacing, and processing temperatures were strongly correlated with bacterial attachment on 304 stainless steel material.Highlights"

"ANDER, Bradley P",The Alpha Linolenic Acid Content of Flaxseed is Associated with an Induction of Adipose Leptin Expression,"Dietary flaxseed has cardioprotective effects that may be achieved through its rich content of the omega-3 fatty acid, alpha linolenic acid (ALA). Because ALA can be stored in adipose tissue, it is possible that some of its beneficial actions may be due to effects it has on the adipose tissue. We investigated the effects of dietary flaxseed both with and without an atherogenic cholesterol-enriched diet to determine the effects of dietary flaxseed on the expression of the adipose cytokines leptin and adiponectin. Rabbits were fed one of four diets: a regular (RG) diet, or a regular diet with added 0.5% cholesterol (CH), or 10% ground flaxseed (FX), or both (CF) for 8 weeks. Levels of leptin and adiponectin expression were assessed by RT-PCR in visceral adipose tissue. Consumption of flaxseed significantly increased plasma and adipose levels of ALA. Leptin protein and mRNA expression were lower in CH animals and were elevated in CF animals. Changes in leptin expression were strongly and positively correlated with adipose ALA levels and inversely correlated with levels of en face atherosclerosis. Adiponectin expression was not significantly affected by any of the dietary interventions. Our data demonstrate that the type of fat in the diet as well as its caloric content can specifically influence leptin expression. The findings support the hypothesis that the beneficial cardiovascular effects associated with flaxseed consumption may be related to a change in leptin expression."

Risk of S. neurona exposure in sea otters is associated with consumption of clams and soft-sediment prey and is temporally associated with runoff events. We examined the spatial distribution of S. neurona exposure risk based on serum antibody testing and assessed risk factors for exposure in animals from California, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska. Significant spatial clustering of seropositive animals was observed in California and Washington, compared with British Columbia and Alaska. Adult males were at greatest risk for exposure to S. neurona, and there were strong associations with terrestrial features (wetlands, cropland, high human housing-unit density). In California, habitats containing soft sediment exhibited greater risk than hard substrate or kelp beds. Consuming a diet rich in clams was also associated with increased exposure risk. These findings suggest a transmission pathway analogous to that described for Toxoplasma gondii, with infectious stages traveling in freshwater runoff and being concentrated in particular locations by marine habitat features, ocean physical processes, and invertebrate bioconcentration."

Persistent environmental racial/ethnic inequalities call for attention to identifying the factors that maintain them. We examined associations between racial residential segregation and racial/ethnic inequalities in exposure to three types of air pollutants. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1990-2011), the U.S. Census (1990- 2010), and the Environmental Protection Agency, we tested the independent and joint contributions of race/ethnicity and metropolitan-level residential segregation on individual levels of exposure to air pollution nationwide. We found that racial and ethnic minorities were exposed to significantly higher levels of air pollution compared to Whites. The difference between minorities and Whites in exposure to all three types of air pollution was most pronounced in metropolitan areas with high levels of residential segregation. The environmental inequities observed in this study call for public health and policy initiatives to ameliorate the sources of racial/ethnic gaps in pollution exposure. Given the links between the physical environment and health, addressing such uneven environmental burdens may be a promising way to improve population health and decrease racial/ethnic inequalities therein."

Here, we explored the consequences of genetically encoded induction of the cell volume-regulating Ca2+-activated KCa3.1 channel (Kcnn4) for murine epidermal homeostasis. Doxycycline-treated mice harboring the KCa3.1+-transgene under the control of the reverse tetracycline-sensitive transactivator (rtTA) showed 800-fold channel overexpression above basal levels in the skin and solid KCa3.1-currents in keratinocytes. This overexpression resulted in epidermal spongiosis, progressive epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis, itch and ulcers. The condition was accompanied by production of the pro-proliferative and pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-Î²1 (60-fold), IL-6 (33-fold), and TNFÎ± (26-fold) in the skin. Treatment of mice with the KCa3.1-selective blocker, Senicapoc, significantly suppressed spongiosis and hyperplasia, as well as induction of IL-Î²1 (-88%) and IL-6 (-90%). In conclusion, KCa3.1-induction in the epidermis caused expression of pro-proliferative cytokines leading to spongiosis, hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. This skin condition resembles pathological features of eczematous dermatitis and identifies KCa3.1 as a regulator of epidermal homeostasis and spongiosis, and as a potential therapeutic target."

At harvest, levels of lesion nematode within roots were consistently lower in nine treatments. EOs were beneficial in mitigating nematode damage."

Taxane chemotherapy is a critical tool in the management of advanced prostate cancer. Additionally, novel drug classes such as PARP inhibitors are being investigated. Despite tremendous progress, resistance to therapy remains as a major impediment to further improvement. Resistance mechanisms appear diverse and are not fully known or understood. This review will highlight recent advances in research regarding mechanisms of resistance to both taxanes (such as increased drug efflux capacity) and PARP inhibitors (such as reversion mutations which restore DNA-repair proficiency). Understanding resistance to therapy promises to remove barriers blocking progress toward improved patient outcomes."
"MARCO, Maria",The Potential Production of the Bioactive Compound Pinene Using Whey Permeate,"Pinene is a secondary plant metabolite that has functional properties as a flavor additive as well as potential cognitive health benefits. Although pinene is present in low concentrations in several plants, it is possible to engineer microorganisms to produce pinene. However, feedstock cost is currently limiting the industrial scale-up of microbial pinene production. One potential solution is to leverage waste streams such as whey permeate as an alternative to expensive feedstocks. Whey permeate is a sterile-filtered dairy effluent that contains 4.5% weight/weight lactose, and it must be processed or disposed of due its high biochemical oxygen demand, often at significant cost to the producer. Approximately 180 million m3 of whey is produced annually in the U.S., and only half of this quantity receives additional processing for the recovery of lactose. Given that organisms such as recombinant Escherichia coli grow on untreated whey permeate, there is an opportunity for dairy producers to microbially produce pinene and reduce the biological oxygen demand of whey permeate via microbial lactose consumption. The process would convert a waste stream into a valuable coproduct. This review examines the current approaches for microbial pinene production, and the suitability of whey permeate as a medium for microbial pinene production."

"WAN, Yu-Jui Yvonne",miR-22 inhibition reduces hepatic steatosis via FGF21 and FGFR1 induction.,"BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Metabolism supports cell proliferation and growth. Surprisingly, the tumor suppressor miR-22 is induced by metabolic stimulators like bile acids. Thus, this study examines whether miR-22 could be a metabolic silencer. METHODS: The relationship between miR-22 and the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and its receptor FGFR1 was studied in cells and fatty livers obtained from patients and mouse models. We evaluated the effect of an miR-22 inhibitor alone and in combination with obeticholic acid (OCA) for the treatment of steatosis. RESULTS: The levels of miR-22 were inversely correlated with those of FGF21, FGFR1, and PGC1Î± in human and mouse fatty livers, suggesting that hepatic miR-22 acts as a metabolic silencer. Indeed, miR-22 reduced FGFR1 by direct targeting and decreased FGF21 by reducing the recruitment of PPARÎ± and PGC1Î± to their binding motifs. In contrast, an miR-22 inhibitor increases hepatic FGF21 and FGFR1, leading to AMPK and ERK1/2 activation, which was effective in treating alcoholic steatosis in mouse models. The farnesoid x receptor-agonist OCA induced FGF21 and FGFR1, as well as their inhibitor miR-22. An miR-22 inhibitor and OCA were effective in treating diet-induced steatosis, both alone and in combination. The combined treatment was the most effective at improving insulin sensitivity, releasing glucagon-like peptide 1, and reducing hepatic triglyceride in obese mice. CONCLUSION: The simultaneous induction of miR-22, FGF21 and FGFR1 by metabolic stimulators may maintain FGF21 homeostasis and restrict ERK1/2 activation. Reducing miR-22 enhances hepatic FGF21 and activates AMPK, which could be a novel approach to treat steatosis and insulin resistance. LAY SUMMARY: This study examines the metabolic role of a tumor suppressor, miR-22, that can be induced by metabolic stimulators such as bile acids. Our novel data revealed that the metabolic silencing effect of miR-22 occurs as a result of reductions in metabolic stimulators, which likely contribute to the development of fatty liver. Consistent with this finding, an miR-22 inhibitor effectively reversed both alcohol- and diet-induced fatty liver; miR-22 inhibition is a promising therapeutic option which could be used in combination with obeticholic acid."

The influence of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) on the distribution of radiologist recall rates is uncertain.ObjectiveTo evaluate radiologists' recall and cancer detection rates before and after beginning interpretation of DBT examinations.Design, setting, and participantsThis cohort study included 198 radiologists from 104 radiology facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium who interpreted 251â€¯384 DBT and 2â€¯000â€¯681 digital mammography (DM) screening examinations from 2009 to 2017, including 126 radiologists (63.6%) who interpreted DBT examinations during the study period and 72 (36.4%) who exclusively interpreted DM examinations (to adjust for secular trends). Data were analyzed from April 2018 to July 2019.ExposuresDigital breast tomosynthesis and DM screening examinations.Main outcomes and measuresRecall rate and cancer detection rate.ResultsA total of 198 radiologists interpreted 2â€¯252â€¯065 DM and DBT examinations (2â€¯000â€¯681 [88.8%] DM examinations; 251â€¯384 [11.2%] DBT examinations; 710â€¯934 patients [31.6%] aged 50-59 years; 1â€¯448â€¯981 [64.3%] non-Hispanic white). Among the 126 radiologists (63.6%) who interpreted DBT examinations, 83 (65.9%) had unadjusted DM recall rates of no more than 12% before using DBT, with a median (interquartile range) recall rate of 10.0% (7.5%-13.0%). On DBT examinations, 96 (76.2%) had an unadjusted recall rate of no more than 12%, with a median (interquartile range) recall rate of 8.8% (6.3%-11.3%). A secular trend in recall rate was observed, with the multivariable-adjusted risk of recall on screening examinations declining by 1.2% (95% CI, 0.9%-1.5%) per year. After adjusting for examination characteristics and secular trends, recall rates were 15% lower on DBT examinations compared with DM examinations interpreted before DBT use (relative risk, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.83-0.87). Adjusted recall rates were significantly lower on DBT examinations compared with DM examinations interpreted before DBT use for 45 radiologists (35.7%) and significantly higher for 18 (14.3%); 63 (50.0%) had no statistically significant change. The unadjusted cancer detection rate on DBT was 5.3 per 1000 examinations (95% CI, 5.0-5.7 per 1000 examinations) compared with 4.7 per 1000 examinations (95% CI, 4.6-4.8 per 1000 examinations) on DM examinations interpreted before DM use (multivariable-adjusted risk ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.33).Conclusions and relevanceIn this study, DBT was associated with an overall decrease in recall rate and an increase in cancer detection rate. However, our results indicated that there is wide variability among radiologists, including a subset of radiologists who experienced increased recall rates on DBT examinations. Radiology practices should audit radiologist DBT screening performance and consider additional DBT training for radiologists whose performance does not improve as expected."

Microdissected normal ductal epithelium from healthy volunteers represents a novel comparator to reveal insights into TNBC heterogeneity and to inform drug development. Using RNA-sequencing data from our institution and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) we compared the transcriptomes of 94 TNBCs, 20 microdissected normal breast tissues from healthy volunteers from the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Tissue Bank, and 10 histologically normal tissues adjacent to tumor. Pathway analysis comparing TNBCs to optimized normal controls of microdissected normal epithelium versus classic controls composed of adjacent normal tissue revealed distinct molecular signatures. Differential gene expression of TNBC compared with normal comparators demonstrated important findings for TNBC-specific clinical trials testing targeted agents; lack of over-expression for negative studies and over-expression in studies with drug activity. Next, by comparing each individual TNBC to the set of microdissected normals, we demonstrate that TNBC heterogeneity is attributable to transcriptional chaos, is associated with non-silent DNA mutational load, and explains transcriptional heterogeneity in addition to known molecular subtypes. Finally, chaos analysis identified 146 core genes dysregulated in >90&nbsp;% of TNBCs revealing an over-expressed central network. In conclusion, use of microdissected normal ductal epithelium from healthy volunteers enables an optimized approach for studying TNBC and uncovers biological heterogeneity mediated by transcriptional chaos."

In 2016, participants at the Western States Endurance Run (WSER), a 100-mile (161-km) foot race, underwent non-targeted metabolomic testing of their post-race plasma. Metabolites associated with faster finish times were identified. Based on these results, runners at the 2017 WSER underwent targeted metabolomics testing, including lipidomics and choline levels. The 2017 participants' plasma metabolites were correlated with finish times and compared with non-athletic controls. In 2016, 427 known molecules were detected using non-targeted metabolomics. Four compounds, all phosphatidylcholines (PCs) were associated with finish time (False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05). All were higher in faster finishers. In 2017, using targeted PC analysis, multiple PCs, measured pre- and post-race, were higher in faster finishers (FDR < 0.05). The majority of PCs was noted to be higher in runners (both pre- and post-race) than in controls (FDR < 0.05). Runners had higher choline levels pre-race compared to controls (p < 0.0001), but choline level did not differ significantly from controls post-race (p = 0.129). Choline levels decreased between the start and the finish of the race (p < 0.0001). Faster finishers had lower choline levels than slower finishers at the race finish (p = 0.028)."

"JOHNSON, Christine K",Global shifts in mammalian population trends reveal key predictors of virus spillover risk,"Emerging infectious diseases in humans are frequently caused by pathogens originating from animal hosts, and zoonotic disease outbreaks present a major challenge to global health. To investigate drivers of virus spillover, we evaluated the number of viruses mammalian species have shared with humans. We discovered that the number of zoonotic viruses detected in mammalian species scales positively with global species abundance, suggesting that virus transmission risk has been highest from animal species that have increased in abundance and even expanded their range by adapting to human-dominated landscapes. Domesticated species, primates and bats were identified as having more zoonotic viruses than other species. Among threatened wildlife species, those with population reductions owing to exploitation and loss of habitat shared more viruses with humans. Exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade facilitates close contact between wildlife and humans, and our findings provide further evidence that exploitation, as well as anthropogenic activities that have caused losses in wildlife habitat quality, have increased opportunities for animal-human interactions and facilitated zoonotic disease transmission. Our study provides new evidence for assessing spillover risk from mammalian species and highlights convergent processes whereby the causes of wildlife population declines have facilitated the transmission of animal viruses to humans."

However, for faculty who do not have experience with this topic area, there are few readily available resources from which to draw. In this paper, we describe how two graduate groups, one focused on plant biology and the other on genomics and genetics approached this challenge together by introducing a course on mental and emotional well-being to their incoming first-year graduate students. We describe the research on workplace mental and emotional well-being and disability prevention which served as the basis for the course content.

Effect of Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta Volume on Outcomes: Data From the AAST AORTA Registry","BackgroundResuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is an endovascular adjunct to hemorrhage control. Success relies on institutional support and focused training in arterial access. We hypothesized that hospitals with higher REBOA volumes will be more successful than low-volume hospitals at aortic occlusion with REBOA.MethodsThis is a retrospective study from the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery Registry from November 2013 to January 2018. Patients aged â‰¥18&nbsp;y who underwent REBOA were included. Successful placement of REBOA catheters (defined as hemodynamic improvement with balloon inflation) was compared between high-volume (â‰¥80 cases; two hospitals), mid-volume (10-20 cases; four hospitals), and low-volume (<10 cases; 14 hospitals) hospitals, adjusting for patient factors.ResultsOf 271 patients from 20 hospitals, 210 patients (77.5%) had successful REBOA placement. Most patients were male (76.0%) and sustained blunt trauma (78.1%). cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was ongoing at the time of REBOA placement in 34.5% of patients. Inpatient mortality was 67.4%, unchanged by hospital volume. Multivariable logistic regression found increased odds of successful REBOA placement at high-volume versus low-volume hospitals (odds ratio [OR], 7.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.10-27.29; P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.002) and mid-volume versus low-volume hospitals (OR, 7.82; 95% CI, 1.52-40.31; P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.014) and decreased odds among patients undergoing CPR during REBOA placement (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.34; P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001) when adjusting for age, sex, mechanism of injury, prehospital CPR, CPR on admission, transfer status, hospital location of REBOA placement, Glasgow Coma Scale â‰¤ 13, and injury severity.ConclusionsHospitals with higher REBOA volumes were more likely to achieve hemodynamic improvement with REBOA inflation. However, mortality and complication rates were unchanged. Independent of hospital volume, ongoing CPR is associated with a decreased odds of successful REBOA placement."

Here, we demonstrate two nonmonotonic changes in the electronic structure of WTe2 upon in situ electron doping. The first phase transition is interpreted in terms of a shear displacement of the top WTe2 layer, which realizes a local crystal structure not normally found in bulk WTe2. The second phase transition is associated with stronger interactions between the dopant atoms and the host, both through hybridization and electric field. These results demonstrate that electron doping can drive structural and electronics changes in bulk WTe2 with implications for realizing nontrivial band-structure changes in heterointerfaces and devices."

"ZIVKOVIC, Angela M",Metabolic flux analysis of the neural cell glycocalyx reveals differential utilization of monosaccharides,"Saccharides in our diet are major sources of carbon for the formation of biomass such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and glycans. Among the dietary monosaccharides, glucose occupies a central role in metabolism, but human blood contains regulated levels of other monosaccharides as well. Their influence on metabolism and how they are utilized have not been explored thoroughly. Applying metabolic flux analysis on glycan synthesis can reveal the pathways that supply glycosylation precursors and provide a snapshot of the metabolic state of the cell. In this study, we traced the incorporation of six 13C uniformly labeled monosaccharides in the N-glycans, O-glycans and glycosphingolipids of both pluripotent and neural NTERA-2 cells. We gathered detailed isotopologue data for hundreds of glycoconjugates using mass spectrometry methods. The contributions of de novo synthesis and direct incorporation pathways for glucose, mannose, fructose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine and fucose were determined based on their isotope incorporation. Co-feeding studies revealed that fructose incorporation is drastically decreased by the presence of glucose, while mannose and galactose were much less affected. Furthermore, increased sialylation slowed down the turnover of glycans, but fucosylation attenuated this effect. Our results demonstrated that exogenous monosaccharide utilization can vary markedly depending on the cell differentiation state and monosaccharide availability, and that the incorporation of carbons can also differ among different glycan structures. We contend that the analysis of metabolic isotope labeling of glycans can yield new insights about cell metabolism."
"VAN DE WATER, Judith A",Baseline immunoreactivity before pregnancy and poly(I:C) dose combine to dictate susceptibility and resilience of offspring to maternal immune activation,"Despite the potential of rodent models of maternal immune activation (MIA) to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic interventions for a range of psychiatric disorders, current approaches using these models ignore two of the most important aspects of this risk factor for human disease: (i) most pregnancies are resilient to maternal viral infection and (ii) susceptible pregnancies can lead to different combinations of phenotypes in offspring. Here, we report two new sources of variability-the baseline immunoreactivity (BIR) of isogenic females prior to pregnancy and differences in immune responses in C57BL/6 dams across vendors-that contribute to resilience and susceptibility to distinct combinations of behavioral and biological outcomes in offspring. Similar to the variable effects of human maternal infection, MIA in mice does not cause disease-related phenotypes in all pregnancies and a combination of poly(I:C) dose and BIR predicts susceptibility and resilience of pregnancies to aberrant repetitive behaviors and alterations in striatal protein levels in offspring. Even more surprising is that the intermediate levels of BIR and poly(I:C) dose are most detrimental to offspring, with higher BIR and poly(I:C) doses conferring resilience to measured phenotypes in offspring. Importantly, we identify the BIR of female mice as a biomarker before pregnancy that predicts which dams will be most at risk as well as biomarkers in the brains of newborn offspring that correlate with changes in repetitive behaviors. Together, our results highlight considerations for optimizing MIA protocols to enhance rigor and reproducibility and reveal new factors that drive susceptibility of some pregnancies and resilience of others to MIA-induced abnormalities in offspring."

We extracted DNA from 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from dogs; 9 of these dogs had DNA available from whole blood samples that had been banked. We genotyped DNA from 30 of 44 tissue blocks and 9 whole blood samples on the Illumina CanineHD BeadChip; DNA quality was insufficient in 14 of 44 samples from tissue blocks. There was significant correlation between the 260/280 ratio and single-nucleotide variation (SNV) call rate (p = 0.0276; r2 = 0.162); 23 of 30 samples from FFPE were genotyped with >â€‰65% call rates. Median pairwise identical-by-state (IBS) analysis was 0.99 in 8 pairs of dogs with call rates >â€‰65%. Neither age of tissue block nor specific tissue types were associated with significant differences in DNA concentration, 260/280 ratio, or SNV call rate. DNA extracted from tissue blocks can have variable quality, although comparable levels of homozygosity suggest that extracts from FFPE with call rates >â€‰65% might provide similar results to samples from whole blood when analyzed on the Illumina CanineHD BeadChip."
"WANG, Yan",Glial type specific regulation of CNS angiogenesis by HIFÎ±-activated different signaling pathways,"The mechanisms by which oligodendroglia modulate CNS angiogenesis remain elusive. Previous in vitro data suggest that oligodendroglia regulate CNS endothelial cell proliferation and blood vessel formation through hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIFÎ±)-activated Wnt (but not VEGF) signaling. Using in vivo genetic models, we show that HIFÎ± in oligodendroglia is necessary and sufficient for angiogenesis independent of CNS regions. At the molecular level, HIFÎ± stabilization in oligodendroglia does not perturb Wnt signaling but rather activates VEGF. At the functional level, genetically blocking oligodendroglia-derived VEGF but not Wnt significantly decreases oligodendroglial HIFÎ±-regulated CNS angiogenesis. Blocking astroglia-derived Wnt signaling reduces astroglial HIFÎ±-regulated CNS angiogenesis. Together, our in vivo data demonstrate that oligodendroglial HIFÎ± regulates CNS angiogenesis through Wnt-independent and VEGF-dependent signaling. These findings suggest an alternative mechanistic understanding of CNS angiogenesis by postnatal glial cells and unveil a glial cell type-dependent HIFÎ±-Wnt axis in regulating CNS vessel formation."

Immunodeficiency virus-infected patients are therefore consigned to lifelong antiviral therapy as a means to control viremia, viral transmission, and infection-associated morbidity. Unfortunately, lifelong antiviral therapies can be difficult for patients to continuously maintain and may be associated with therapy-specific morbidities. Patient advocates have argued for new methods to achieve retroviral eradication. As a proof-of-concept study, a lentivirus-delivered RNA-directed gene editing strategy was utilized in a series of in vitro experiments in an attempt to attenuate the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral load, viral transcription, and production of infectious virions. We found that a feline T lymphocyte cell line (MCH5-4) treated with an FIV-specific clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing tool resulted in a reduction of cell-free viral RNA relative to control cells. Decreased infectious potential was demonstrated in a two-step FIV infection study-naÃ¯ve MCH5-4 cells infected with cell-free FIV harvested from FIV-infected and CRISPR lentivirus-treated cells had less integrated proviral DNA than control cells. This study represents the initial steps towards the development of an effective method of proviral eradication in an immunodeficiency virus-infected host."
"TONG, Elisa K",The Emergence of a Sustainable Tobacco Treatment Program across the Cancer Care Continuum: A Systems Approach for Implementation at the University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center,"Tobacco treatment is increasingly recognized as important to cancer care, but few cancer centers have implemented sustainable tobacco treatment programs. The University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCD CCC) was funded to integrate tobacco treatment into cancer care. Lessons learned from the UCD CCC are illustrated across a systems framework with the Cancer Care Continuum and by applying constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Findings demonstrate different motivational drivers for the cancer center and the broader health system. Implementation readiness across the domains of the Cancer Care Continuum with clinical entities was more mature in the Prevention domain, but Screening, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Survivorship domains demonstrated less implementation readiness despite leadership engagement. Over a two-year implementation process, the UCD CCC focused on enhancing information and knowledge sharing within the treatment domain with the support of the cancer committee infrastructure, while identifying available resources and adapting workflows for various cancer care service lines. The UCD CCC findings, while it may not be generalizable to all cancer centers, demonstrate the application of conceptual frameworks to accelerate implementation for a sustainable tobacco treatment program. Key common elements that may be shared across oncology settings include a state quitline for an adaptable intervention, cancer committees for outer/inner setting infrastructure, tobacco quality metrics for data reporting, and non-physician staff for integrated services."

We evaluated serum E2 concentrations twice weekly for the primary outcome of median E2 concentrations throughout initial 30-day use (target â‰¥40&nbsp;pg/mL). In an optional 2-cycle extension substudy, we randomized participants to 2- or 4-day ring-free intervals per 30-day cycle to evaluate bleeding and spotting based on daily diary information.ResultsSixty-five participants enrolled in E2 75 (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;22), 100 (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;21), and 200 (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;22)&nbsp;mcg/day groups; 35 participated in the substudy. Median serum E2 concentrations in 75 and 100&nbsp;mcg/day groups were <40&nbsp;pg/mL. In the 200&nbsp;mcg/day group, median E2 concentrations peaked on days 4-5 of CVR use at 194&nbsp;pg/mL (range 114-312&nbsp;pg/mL) and remained >40&nbsp;pg/mL throughout 30&nbsp;days; E2 concentrations were 37&nbsp;pg/mL (range 28-62&nbsp;pg/mL) on days 88-90 (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;11). Among the E2 200&nbsp;mcg/day substudy participants, all had withdrawal bleeding following ring removal. The 2-day ring-free interval group reported zero median unscheduled bleeding and two (range 0-16) and three (range 0-19) unscheduled spotting days in extension cycles 1 and 2, respectively. The 4-day ring-free interval group reported zero median unscheduled bleeding or spotting days.ConclusionsEstradiol concentrations with rings releasing E2 200&nbsp;mcg/day and SA 200&nbsp;mcg/day avoid hypoestrogenism over 30-day use.ImplicationsA 90-day contraceptive vaginal ring releasing estradiol 200&nbsp;mcg/day and segesterone acetate 200&nbsp;mcg/day achieves estradiol concentrations that should avoid hypoestrogenism and effectively suppresses ovulation."
"LESHIKAR, David E",Fatal cardiac injury sustained from an air gun: Case report with review of the literature.,"INTRODUCTION: Traditionally promoted as toy guns, air guns have long been used by children and lack many regulatory guidelines compared to conventional firearms. However these weapons possess serious lethal potential and have led to numerous injuries and deaths. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We describe a 21 year old man who sustained a penetrating cardiac wound from a pellet gun that led to cardiac tamponade and death. Post-mortem examination showed the pellet had penetrated the left ventricle and anterior esophagus with subsequent intraluminal migration into the stomach. DISCUSSION: Review of the literature identified 39 other cases of penetrating cardiac injuries from air guns. Sternotomy was the most frequently used surgical approach and the right and left ventricles were the most commonly affected chambers. Bullet embolization was the most frequently reported complication. Including our case, five deaths related to penetrating cardiac injury from air guns were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the seriousness of air guns and demonstrates a unique intra-thoracic injury."

"LOUIE, Angelique Y",Two-way magnetic resonance tuning and enhanced subtraction imaging for non-invasive and quantitative biological imaging,"Distance-dependent magnetic resonance tuning (MRET) technology enables the sensing and quantitative imaging of biological targets in vivo, with the advantage of deep tissue penetration and fewer interactions with the surroundings as compared with those of fluorescence-based FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer. However, applications of MRET technology in vivo are currently limited by the moderate contrast enhancement and stability of T1-based MRET probes. Here we report a new two-way magnetic resonance tuning (TMRET) nanoprobe with dually activatable T1 and T2 magnetic resonance signals that is coupled with dual-contrast enhanced subtraction imaging. This integrated platform achieves a substantially improved contrast enhancement with minimal background signal and can be used to quantitatively image molecular targets in tumours and to sensitively detect very small intracranial brain tumours in patient-derived xenograft models. The high tumour-to-normal tissue ratio offered by TMRET in combination with dual-contrast enhanced subtraction imaging provides new opportunities for molecular diagnostics and image-guided biomedical applications."

"DINESH-KUMAR, Savithramma P",TurboID-Based Proximity Labeling for In Planta Identification of Protein-Protein Interaction Networks.,"Proximity labeling (PL) techniques using engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) or Escherichia coli biotin ligase BirA (known as BioID) have been successfully used for identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in mammalian cells. However, requirements of toxic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in APEX-based PL, longer incubation time with biotin (16-24 h), and higher incubation temperature (37 Â°C) in BioID-based PL severely limit their applications in plants. The recently described TurboID-based PL addresses many limitations of BioID and APEX. TurboID allows rapid proximity labeling of proteins in just 10â€‰min under room temperature (RT) conditions. Although the utility of TurboID has been demonstrated in animal models, we recently showed that TurboID-based PL performs better in plants compared to BioID for labeling of proteins that are proximal to a protein of interest. Provided here is a step-by-step protocol for the identification of protein interaction partners using the N-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain of the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein family as a model. The method describes vector construction, agroinfiltration of protein expression constructs, biotin treatment, protein extraction and desalting, quantification, and enrichment of the biotinylated proteins by affinity purification. The protocol described here can be easily adapted to study other proteins of interest in Nicotiana and other plant species."
"ZAINI, Paulo",High-quality chromosome-scale assembly of the walnut (Juglans regia L.) reference genome.,"The release of the first reference genome of walnut (Juglans regia L.) enabled many achievements in the characterization of walnut genetic and functional variation. However, it is highly fragmented, preventing the integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic information to fully elucidate walnut biological processes. Here, we report the new chromosome-scale assembly of the walnut reference genome (Chandler v2.0) obtained by combining Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing with chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology. Relative to the previous reference genome, the new assembly features an 84.4-fold increase in N50 size, with the 16 chromosomal pseudomolecules assembled and representing 95% of its total length. Using full-length transcripts from single-molecule real-time sequencing, we predicted 37,554 gene models, with a mean gene length higher than the previous gene annotations. Most of the new protein-coding genes (90%) present both start and stop codons, which represents a significant improvement compared with Chandler v1.0 (only 48%). We then tested the potential impact of the new chromosome-level genome on different areas of walnut research. By studying the proteome changes occurring during male flower development, we observed that the virtual proteome obtained from Chandler v2.0 presents fewer artifacts than the previous reference genome, enabling the identification of a new potential pollen allergen in walnut. Also, the new chromosome-scale genome facilitates in-depth studies of intraspecies genetic diversity by revealing previously undetected autozygous regions in Chandler, likely resulting from inbreeding, and 195 genomic regions highly differentiated between Western and Eastern walnut cultivars. Overall, Chandler v2.0 will serve as a valuable resource to better understand and explore walnut biology."

In cases of tumor-associated hydrops, there is significant risk of fetal demise, and prenatal intervention may be considered to avoid this outcome when possible. When fetal intervention is unlikely to improve survival, information can be useful for counseling families. We present a rare case of fetal diagnosis of a primary renal malignancy with widespread metastases and hydrops, with unique immunohistochemical findings consistent with malignant primitive epithelioid sarcoma with features of rhabdoid tumor."

"LIN, Su-Ju","N-terminal protein acetylation by NatB modulates the levels of Nmnats, the NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAD+ metabolism requires Nt-acetylation of Nmnats","NAD+ is an essential metabolite participating in cellular biochemical processes and signaling. The regulation and interconnection among multiple NAD+ biosynthesis pathways are incompletely understood. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells lacking the N-terminal (Nt) protein acetyltransferase complex NatB exhibit an approximate 50% reduction in NAD+ levels and aberrant metabolism of NAD+ precursors, changes that are associated with a decrease in nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat) protein levels. Here, we show that this decrease in NAD+ and Nmnat protein levels is specifically due to the absence of Nt-acetylation of Nmnat (Nma1 and Nma2) proteins and not of other NatB substrates. Nt-acetylation critically regulates protein degradation by the N-end rule pathways, suggesting that the absence of Nt-acetylation may alter Nmnat protein stability. Interestingly, the rate of protein turnover (tÂ½) of non-Nt-acetylated Nmnats did not significantly differ from those of Nt-acetylated Nmnats. Accordingly, deletion or depletion of the N-end rule pathway ubiquitin E3 ligases in NatB mutants did not restore NAD+ levels. Next, we examined whether the status of Nt-acetylation would affect the translation of Nmnats, finding that the absence of Nt-acetylation does not significantly alter the polysome formation rate on Nmnat mRNAs. However, we observed that NatB mutants have significantly reduced Nmnat protein maturation. Our findings indicate that the reduced Nmnat levels in NatB mutants are mainly due to inefficient protein maturation. Nmnat activities are essential for all NAD+ biosynthesis routes, and understanding the regulation of Nmnat protein homeostasis may improve our understanding of the molecular basis and regulation of NAD+ metabolism."

Due to high rates of brown dog tick infestation, susceptibility, and association with humans, dogs serve as sentinels and have a key role in the ecology of RMSF. A cross-sectional household questionnaire study was conducted in six rural and urban locations to characterize dog ecology and demography in RMSF high-and low-risk areas of Mexicali. In addition, we tracked movement patterns of 16 dogs using a GPS data logger. Of 253 households, 73% owned dogs, and dog ownership tended to be higher in high-risk areas, with a mean dog:human ratio of 0.43, compared with 0.3 in low-risk areas. Dogs in high-risk areas had higher fecundity and roamed more, but the dog density and numbers of free-roaming dogs were comparable. There was a higher proportion of younger dogs and lower proportion of older dogs in high-risk areas. The high proportion of immunologically naÃ¯ve puppies in high risk areas could result in a lack of herd immunity leading to a more vulnerable dog and human population. The marked increase of space use of free-roaming dogs in high-risk areas suggests that unrestrained dogs could play an important role in spreading ticks and pathogens. As means to limit RMSF risk, practical changes could include increased efforts for spay-neuter and policies encouraging dog restraint to limit canine roaming and spread of ticks across communities; due to dog density is less impactful such policies may be more useful than restrictions on the number of owned dogs."

"LEAL, Walter",How frequently do clusters occur in hierarchical clustering analysis? A graph theoretical approach to studying ties in proximity,"BackgroundHierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) is a widely used classificatory technique in many areas of scientific knowledge. Applications usually yield a dendrogram from an HCA run over a given data set, using a grouping algorithm and a similarity measure. However, even when such parameters are fixed, ties in proximity (i.e. two equidistant clusters from a third one) may produce several different dendrograms, having different possible clustering patterns (different classifications). This situation is usually disregarded and conclusions are based on a single result, leading to questions concerning the permanence of clusters in all the resulting dendrograms; this happens, for example, when using HCA for grouping molecular descriptors to select that less similar ones in QSAR studies.ResultsRepresenting dendrograms in graph theoretical terms allowed us to introduce four measures of cluster frequency in a canonical way, and use them to calculate cluster frequencies over the set of all possible dendrograms, taking all ties in proximity into account. A toy example of well separated clusters was used, as well as a set of 1666 molecular descriptors calculated for a group of molecules having hepatotoxic activity to show how our functions may be used for studying the effect of ties in HCA analysis. Such functions were not restricted to the tie case; the possibility of using them to derive cluster stability measurements on arbitrary sets of dendrograms having the same leaves is discussed, e.g. dendrograms from variations of HCA parameters. It was found that ties occurred frequently, some yielding tens of thousands of dendrograms, even for small data sets.ConclusionsOur approach was able to detect trends in clustering patterns by offering a simple way of measuring their frequency, which is often very low. This would imply, that inferences and models based on descriptor classifications (e.g. QSAR) are likely to be biased, thereby requiring an assessment of their reliability. Moreover, any classification of molecular descriptors is likely to be far from unique. Our results highlight the need for evaluating the effect of ties on clustering patterns before classification results can be used accurately.Graphical abstractFour cluster contrast functions identifying statistically sound clusters within dendrograms considering ties in proximity."

"HUMPHRIES, Misty D",Evaluation and treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome during the global pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.,"The global SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has required a reduction in nonemergency treatment for a variety of disorders. This report summarizes conclusions of an international multidisciplinary consensus group assembled to address evaluation and treatment of patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), a group of conditions characterized by extrinsic compression of the neurovascular structures serving the upper extremity. The following recommendations were developed in relation to the three defined types of TOS (neurogenic, venous, and arterial) and three phases of pandemic response (preparatory, urgent with limited resources, and emergency with complete diversion of resources). â€¢ In-person evaluation and treatment for neurogenic TOS (interventional or surgical) are generally postponed during all pandemic phases, with telephone/telemedicine visits and at-home physical therapy exercises recommended when feasible. â€¢ Venous TOS presenting with acute upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (Paget-Schroetter syndrome) is managed primarily with anticoagulation, with percutaneous interventions for venous TOS (thrombolysis) considered in early phases (I&nbsp;and II) and surgical treatment delayed until pandemic conditions resolve. Catheter-based interventions may also be considered for selected patients with central subclavian vein obstruction and threatened hemodialysis access in all pandemic phases, with definitive surgical treatment postponed. â€¢ Evaluation and surgical treatment for arterial TOS should be reserved for limb-threatening situations, such as acute upper extremity ischemia or acute digital embolization, in all phases of pandemic response. In late pandemic phases, surgery should be restricted to thrombolysis or brachial artery thromboembolectomy, with more definitive treatment delayed until pandemic conditions resolve."

"WUN, Theodore",Treatment Complications and Survival Among Children and Young Adults With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,"PURPOSE: We previously demonstrated lower early mortality for young adults (YAs) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received induction treatment at specialized cancer centers (SCCs) versus community hospitals. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of inpatient location of treatment throughout therapy on long-term survival, complications, and cost-associations that have not yet been evaluated at the population level. METHODS: Using the California Cancer Registry linked to a hospitalization database, we identified patients, 0-39 years of age, diagnosed with first primary ALL who received inpatient treatment between 1991 and 2014. Patients were classified as receiving all or part or none of their inpatient treatment at an SCC within 3 years of diagnosis. Inverse probability-weighted, multivariable Cox regression models estimated the associations between location of treatment and sociodemographic and clinical factors with survival. We compared 3-year inpatient costs overall and per day by age group and location of care. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent (0-18 years; n = 4,549) of children and 36% of YAs (19-39 years; n = 683) received all treatment at SCCs. Receiving all treatment at an SCC was associated with superior leukemia-specific (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.88) and overall survival (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.97) in children and in YAs (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.83; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.80) even after controlling for complications. The cost of inpatient care during the full course of therapy was higher in patients receiving all of their care at SCCs. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that inpatient treatment at an SCC throughout therapy is associated with superior survival; therefore, strong consideration should be given to referring these patients to SCCs."
"MCKENNEY, Richard J",Temperature-dependent activity of kinesins is regulable,"Cytoskeletal transport in cells is driven by enzymes whose activity shows sensitive, typically Arrhenius, dependence on temperature. Often, the duration and outcome of cargo transport is determined by the relative success of kinesin vs. dynein motors, which can simultaneously bind to individual cargos and move in opposite direction on microtubules. The question of how kinesin and dynein activity remain coupled over the large temperature ranges experienced by some cells is one of clear biological relevance. We report a break in the Arrhenius behavior of both kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 enzymatic activity at 4.7&nbsp;Â°C and 10.5&nbsp;Â°C, respectively. Further, we report that this transition temperature significantly changes as a function of chemical background: addition of 200&nbsp;mM TMAO increases transition temperatures by âˆ¼6&nbsp;Â°C in all cases. Our results show that Arrhenius trend breaks are common to all cytoskeletal motors and open a broad question of how such activity transitions are regulated in&nbsp;vivo. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Many cytoskeletal motors studied to date follow Arrhenius kinetics, at least from room temperature up to mammalian body temperature. However the thermal dynamic range is typically finite, and breaks in Arrhenius trends are commonly observed at biologically relevant temperatures. Here we report that the thermal dynamic range of kinesins is also limited and moreover that the location of the Arrhenius break for kinesins can shift significantly based on chemical backgrounds. This implies that the balance of multiple motor cargo transport along the cytoskeleton is far more tunable as a function of temperature than previously appreciated."

Ventilation images were calculated with deformable image registration to map the end-expiratory and end-inspiratory CT images and quantitative analysis for regional volume changes as surrogates for ventilation. Perfusion images were calculated by subtracting the end-inspiratory precontrast CT from the deformably registered end-inspiratory postcontrast CT, yielding a map of regional Hounsfield unit enhancement as a surrogate for perfusion. Ventilation-perfusion matching, spatial heterogeneity, and gravitationally directed gradients were compared between two groups using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.ResultsThe normal group had significantly higher Dice similarity coefficients for spatial overlap of segmented functional volumes between ventilation and perfusion (median 0.40 vs. 0.33, pâ€¯=â€¯0.05), suggesting stronger ventilation-perfusion matching. The normal group also had greater Spearman's correlation coefficients based on 16 regions of interest (median 0.58 vs. 0.40, pâ€¯=â€¯0.09). The coefficients of variation were comparable (median, ventilation 0.71 vs. 0.91, pâ€¯=â€¯0.60; perfusion 0.63 vs. 0.75, pâ€¯=â€¯0.27). The linear regression slopes of gravitationally directed gradient were also comparable for ventilation (median, ventilation -0.26 vs. -0.18, pâ€¯=â€¯0.19; perfusion -0.17 vs. -0.06, pâ€¯=â€¯0.11).ConclusionThese findings provide proof-of-principle for single-energy CT ventilation/perfusion imaging."

The goal of this study was to complete an in-depth immunohistochemistry analysis of affected FCGS mucosa, to perform and compare immune cell phenotypes in the blood of FCGS and healthy controls cats, and to determine a transcriptomic profile of the affected and normal oral mucosa of FCGS cats. We hypothesized that cats with FCGS would have circulating activated CD8+ T cells and that tissues would be infiltrated with activated B and T cells with a highly proinflammatory transcriptome. We found that oral mucosal tissues from cats with FCGS have high tissue infiltration of B cells and that T cells include both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. Cells positive for CD25 (IL2 receptor, indicative of lymphocyte activation) and FOXP3 (indicative of regulatory T cells) were scattered throughout the mucosa. Compared to healthy individuals, cats with FCGS had high circulating CD8+ effector memory cells with a concurrent decrease in central memory cells and evidence of circulating activated CD8+ T cells (CD25+, CD62L-). Gene expression in the affected tissues was enriched for genes associated with T-cell signaling, cell adhesion molecules, leukocyte migration, inflammatory signaling pathways, extracellular matrix-receptor interactions, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, among others. These data are essential to understand disease pathogenesis, to inform mechanism of action studies for future and current therapies, and to help select prognostic biomarkers and potency assays for stem cell treatment of FCGS."

A synthetic biological module, however, can be designed to reprogram the host proteome, which in turn enhances the function of the synthetic module. Here, we apply this holistic synthetic biology concept to the engineering of cell-free systems by exploiting the crosstalk between metabolic networks in cells, leading to a protein environment more favorable for protein synthesis. Specifically, we show that local modules expressing translation machinery can reprogram the bacterial proteome, changing the expression levels of more than 700 proteins. The resultant feedback generates a cell-free system that can synthesize fluorescent reporters, protein nanocages, and the gene-editing nuclease Cas9, with up to 5-fold higher expression level than classical cell-free systems. Our work demonstrates a holistic approach that integrates synthetic and systems biology concepts to achieve outcomes not possible by only local, orthogonal circuits."

However, the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. This pilot study investigated the genomic pathways by which the WD and hyperlipidemia regulate gene expression in brain microvessels. Five-week-old C57BL/6J wild type (WT) control and low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient (LDL-R-/-) male mice were fed the WD for eight weeks. Differential gene expression, gene networks and pathways, transcription factors, and non-protein coding RNAs were evaluated by a genome-wide microarray and bioinformatics analysis of laser-captured hippocampal microvessels. The WD resulted in the differential expression of 1972 genes. Much of the differentially expressed gene (DEG) was attributable to the differential regulation of cell signaling proteins and their transcription factors, approximately 4% was attributable to the differential expression of miRNAs, and 10% was due to other non-protein coding RNAs, primarily long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) not previously described to be modified by the WD. Lipotoxic injury resulted in complex and multilevel molecular regulation of the hippocampal microvasculature involving transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation and may provide a molecular basis for a better understanding of hyperlipidemia-associated dementia risk."

The Fire and Tree Mortality (FTM) database includes records from 164,293 individual trees with records of fire injury (crown scorch, bole char, etc.), tree diameter, and either mortality or top-kill up to ten years post-fire. Data span 142 species and 62 genera, from 409 fires occurring from 1981-2016. Additional variables such as insect attack are included when available. The FTM database can be used to evaluate individual fire-caused mortality models for pre-fire planning and post-fire decision support, to develop improved models, and to explore general patterns of individual fire-induced tree death. The database can also be used to identify knowledge gaps that could be addressed in future research."
"KINNE, Brandon J",Does third-party trade reduce conflict? Credible signaling versus opportunity costs,"The study of trade and conflict has largely focused on dyadic interdependence, or trade within discrete pairs of states. Yet, states may also be indirectly interdependent, by way of trade to third parties. This paper examines the influence of third-party trade on dyadic conflict initiation. I argue that certain structures of trade provide economically invested third parties with (1) an incentive to discourage dyadic conflict between a potential initiator and a potential target, and (2) the means to show disapproval of conflict by sending trade-based signals of resolve. The argument thus emphasizes the ability of third parties to introduce novel ex post information into bargaining dynamics, causing potential aggressors to reconsider their conflict strategies. Empirical analysis shows that, in fact, when a given dyad shares the sort of trade structures that enable costly signaling by third parties, the probability of conflict initiation declines substantially. In contrast, when third-party trade merely increases a potential initiator's opportunity costs for conflict, conflict behavior remains unchanged. Â© The Author(s) 2013."

Experiments verifying the orientation of the interfacial DMI vector remain rare, in part due to the difficulty of separating vector components of DMI. In this study, Fe/Ni bilayers and Co/Ni multilayers were deposited epitaxially onto Cu(001) and Pt(111) substrates, respectively. By tailoring the effective anisotropy, spin reorientation transitions (SRTs) are employed to probe the orientation of the DMI vector by measuring the spin structure of domain walls on both sides of the SRTs. The interfacial DMI is found to be sufficiently strong to stabilize chiral NÃ©el walls in the out-of-plane magnetized regimes, while achiral NÃ©el walls are observed in the in-plane magnetized regimes. These findings experimentally confirm that the out-of-plane component of the DMI vector is insignificant in these fcc(001) and fcc(111) oriented interfaces, even in the presence of atomic steps."
"BANNASCH, Danika",Quantitative Translation of Dog-to-Human Aging by Conserved Remodeling of the DNA Methylome,"All mammals progress through similar physiological stages throughout life, from early development to puberty, aging, and death. Yet, the extent to which this conserved physiology reflects underlying genomic events is unclear. Here, we map the common methylation changes experienced by mammalian genomes as they age, focusing on comparison of humans with dogs, an emerging model of aging. Using oligo-capture sequencing, we characterize methylomes of 104 Labrador retrievers spanning a 16-year age range, achieving >150Ã— coverage within mammalian syntenic blocks. Comparison with human methylomes reveals a nonlinear relationship that translates dog-to-human years and aligns the timing of major physiological milestones between the two species, with extension to mice. Conserved changes center on developmental gene networks, which are sufficient to translate age and the effects of anti-aging interventions across multiple mammals. These results establish methylation not only as a diagnostic age readout but also as a cross-species translator of physiological aging milestones."
"BAKERJIAN, Deb",Appropriate Nurse Staffing Levels for U.S. Nursing Homes.,"US nursing homes are required to have sufficient nursing staff with the appropriate competencies to assure resident safety and attain or maintain the highest practicable level of physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident. Minimum nurse staffing levels have been identified in research studies and recommended by experts. Beyond the minimum levels, nursing homes must take into account the resident acuity to assure they have adequate staffing levels to meet the needs of residents. This paper presents a guide for determining whether a nursing home has adequate and appropriate nurse staffing. We propose five basic steps to: (1) determine the collective resident acuity and care needs, (2) determine the actual nurse staffing levels, (3) identify appropriate nurse staffing levels to meet residents care needs, (4) examine evidence regarding the adequacy of staffing, and (5) identify gaps between the actual staffing and the appropriate nursing staffing levels based on resident acuity. Data sources and specific methodologies are analyzed, compared, and recommended. The goal is to assist nursing home nurses and administrators to ensure adequate nursing home staffing levels that protect resident health, safety, and well-being."

We evaluated the association between program implementation and use of oral morphine equivalents (OME), average pain scores, time to first ambulation after surgery, urinary catheter duration, time to solid food after surgery, length of stay, discharge opioid prescriptions, and readmission.ResultsMultivariate regression demonstrated that the program was associated with significant decreases in intraoperative OME (14.5 Â± 2.4 mEQ (milliequivalents) reduction; p < 0.0001), day before discharge OME (18 Â± 6.5 mEQ reduction; p < 0.005), day of discharge OME (9.6 Â± 3.28 mEQ reduction; p < 0.003), and discharge prescription OME (156 Â± 22â€‰mEq reduction; p < 0.001). Reduction in OME was associated with earlier resumption of solid food (0.58 Â± 0.15â€‰days reduction; p < 0.0002).ConclusionOur multifaceted optimal analgesia program to manage perioperative pain in the hospital was effective and further improved analgesia in the setting of a mature enhanced recovery program."

"BERS, Donald M",Metabolic Maturation Media Improve Physiological Function of Human iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes,"Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have enormous potential for the study of human cardiac disorders. However, their physiological immaturity severely limits their utility as a model system and their adoption for drug discovery. Here, we describe maturation media designed to provide oxidative substrates adapted to the metabolic needs of human iPSC (hiPSC)-CMs. Compared with conventionally cultured hiPSC-CMs, metabolically matured hiPSC-CMs contract with greater force and show an increased reliance on cardiac sodium (Na+) channels and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca2+) cycling. The media enhance the function, long-term survival, and sarcomere structures in engineered heart tissues. Use of the maturation media made it possible to reliably model two genetic cardiac diseases: long QT syndrome type 3 due to a mutation in the cardiac Na+ channel SCN5A and dilated cardiomyopathy due to a mutation in the RNA splicing factor RBM20. The maturation media should increase the fidelity of hiPSC-CMs as disease models."

"YIU, Glenn C",Quantitative Fundus Autofluorescence in Rhesus Macaques in Aging and Age-Related Drusen,"PurposeTo employ quantitative fundus autofluorescence (qAF) imaging in rhesus macaques to noninvasively assess retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) lipofuscin in nonhuman primates (NHPs) as a model of aging and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).MethodsThe qAF imaging was performed on eyes of 26 rhesus macaques (mean age 18.8 Â± 8.2 years, range 4-27 years) with normal-appearing fundus or with age-related soft drusen using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope with 488 nm excitation and an internal fluorescence reference. Eyes with soft drusen also underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging to measure drusen volume and height of individual drusen lesions. The qAF levels were measured from the perifoveal annular ring (quantitative autofluorescence 8 [qAF8]) using the Delori grid, as well as focally over individual drusen lesions in this region. The association between qAF levels and age, sex, and drusen presence and volume were determined using multivariable regression analysis.ResultsMean qAF levels increased with age (P < 0.001) and were higher in females (P = 0.047). Eyes with soft drusen exhibited reduced mean qAF compared with age-matched normal eyes (P = 0.003), with greater drusen volume showing a trend toward decreased qAF levels. However, qAF levels are focally increased over most individual drusen (P < 0.001), with larger drusen appearing more hyperautofluorescent (R2 = 0.391, P < 0.001).ConclusionsIn rhesus macaques, qAF levels are increased with age and female sex, but decreased in eyes with soft drusen, similar to human AMD. However, drusen lesions appear hyperautofluorescent unlike those in humans, suggesting similarities and differences in RPE lipofuscin between humans and NHPs that may provide insight into drusen biogenesis and AMD pathogenesis."

The objectives of this study were to determine the feasibility and utility of a brief tablet-based screening method in the ED and if patients would consider a face-to-face meeting with a certified alcohol and drug counselor (CADC) for more in-depth screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) helpful via this interface.MethodsA tablet-based questionnaire was offered to 500 patients. Inclusion criteria were age â‰¥18, Emergency Severity Index 2-5, and English comprehension. Subjects were excluded if they had evidence of acute intoxication and/or received sedating medication.ResultsA total of 283 (57%) subjects were enrolled over a 4-week period, which represented an increase of 183% over the monthly average of patients referred for SBIRT by the CADC prior to the study. There were 131 (46%) who screened positive for unhealthy alcohol and drug use, with 51 (39%) and 37 (28%) who screened positive for solely unhealthy alcohol use and drug use/drug use disorders, respectively. There were 43 (33%) who screened positive for combined unhealthy alcohol and drug use. Despite willingness to participate in the tablet-based questionnaire, only 20 (15%) with a positive screen indicated via the tablet that a face-to-face meeting with the CADC for further SBIRT would be helpful.ConclusionBrief tablet-based screening for unhealthy alcohol and drug use in the ED was an effective method to increase the number of adult patients identified than solely by their treating clinicians. However, only a minority of subjects screening positive using this interface believed a face-to-face meeting with the CADC for further SBIRT would be helpful."

"BARKER, Christopher M",Quantifying sociodemographic heterogeneities in the distribution of Aedes aegypti among California households,"The spread of Aedes aegypti in California and other regions of the U.S. has increased the need to understand the potential for local chains of Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission, particularly in arid regions where the ecology of these mosquitoes is less understood. For public health and vector control programs, it is helpful to know whether variation in risk of local transmission can be attributed to socio-demographic factors that could help to target surveillance and control programs. Socio-demographic factors have been shown to influence transmission risk of dengue virus outside the U.S. by modifying biting rates and vector abundance. In regions of the U.S. where Ae. aegypti have recently invaded and where residential areas are structured differently than those in the tropics where Ae. aegypti are endemic, it is unclear how socio-demographic factors modify the abundance of Ae. aegypti populations. Understanding heterogeneities among households in Ae. aegypti abundance will provide a better understanding of local vectorial capacity and is an important component of understanding risk of local Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Los Angeles County, California during summer 2017 to understand the causes of variation in relative abundance of Ae. aegypti among households. We surveyed 161 houses, representing a wide range of incomes. Surveys consisted of systematic adult mosquito collections, inspections of households and properties, and administration of a questionnaire in English or Spanish. Adult Ae. aegypti were detected at 72% of households overall and were found indoors at 12% of households. An average of 3.1 Ae. aegypti were collected per household. Ae. aegypti abundance outdoors was higher in lower-income neighborhoods and around older households with larger outdoor areas, greater densities of containers with standing water, less frequent yard maintenance, and greater air-conditioner use. We also found that Ae. aegypti abundance indoors was higher in households that had less window and door screening, less air-conditioner usage, more potted plants indoors, more rain-exposed containers around the home, and lower neighborhood human population densities. Our results indicate that, in the areas of southern California studied, there are behavioral and socio-demographic determinants of Ae. aegypti abundance, and that low-income households could be at higher risk for exposure to Ae. aegypti biting and potentially greater risk for Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus transmission if a local outbreak were to occur."
"MORRISON, Amy C","Measuring health related quality of life for dengue patients in Iquitos, Peru","Previous studies measuring the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of individuals with dengue focused on treatment seeking populations. However, the vast majority of global dengue cases are unlikely to be detected by health systems. Representative measurements of HRQoL should therefore include patients with disease not likely to trigger treatment-seeking behavior. This study based in Iquitos, Peru used the Quality of Wellbeing Scale-Self Administered, a survey that enquires about not only physical health, but also psychological health, self-care, mobility, and usual social activities, and rates HRQoL between 0 (death) and 1 (optimum function), to evaluate the impact of dengue on HRQoL. In order to enroll treatment and non treatment-seeking participants, three modalities of participant recruitment were used. In addition to clinic and community-based febrile surveillance, a contact-cluster methodology was also employed to identify infected individuals less likely to seek treatment. We measured changes in HRQoL and identified common areas of health impairment in 73 virologically confirmed dengue cases at 3 time points during the participant's illness; the early-acute (days 0-6 post symptom onset), late-acute (days 7-20), and convalescent illness phases (days 21 +). Participants reported HRQoL related impairments at significantly higher frequency during the early-acute versus convalescent illness phase (Fisher's exact: P<0.01). There was substantial heterogeneity in scores during each illness phase with median scores in the early-acute, late-acute and convalescent phases of 0.56 (IQR: 0.41-0.64), 0.70 (IQR: 0.57-0.94), and 1 (IQR: 0.80-1.00), respectively. In all illness phases participants recruited in clinics had on average the lowest HRQoL scores where as those recruited in the contact clusters had the highest. Only 1 individual who was recruited in the contact-clusters had no reduction in HRQoL score during their illness. These data illustrate that dengue should be considered as a disease that may have significant implications for not only physical health but also psychological health and social functioning. The impact of dengue on the HRQoL of non-treatment-seeking individuals, although lower than the impact among treatment-seeking individuals, is not necessarily trivial."

"LIU, Hong",Double standard: why electrocardiogram is standard care while electroencephalogram is not?,"Purpose of reviewMajor adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) significantly affect the surgical outcomes. Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been a standard intraoperative monitor for 30 years. Electroencephalogram (EEG) can provide valuable information about the anesthetized state and guide anesthesia management during surgery. Whether EEG should be a standard intraoperative monitor is discussed in this review.Recent findingsDeep anesthesia has been associated with postoperative delirium, especially in elderly patients. Intraoperative EEG monitoring has been demonstrated to reduce total anesthesia drug use during general anesthesia and postoperative delirium.SummaryUnlike ECG monitoring, the EEG under general anesthesia has not been designated as a standard monitor by anesthesiologist societies around the world. The processed EEG technology has been commercially available for more than 25 years and EEG technology has significantly facilitated its intraoperative use. It is time to consider EEG as a standard anesthesia monitor during surgery."

"SOLOMON, Marjorie",Developmentalâ€“behavioral profiles in children with autism spectrum disorder and coâ€occurring gastrointestinal symptoms,"Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are frequently reported in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We evaluated the frequency and severity of GI symptoms in preschool-aged children with ASD compared to participants with typical development (TD). Our goal was to ascertain whether GI symptoms are associated with differences in sex or developmental and behavioral measures. Participants were between 2 and 3.5â€‰years of age and included 255 children with ASD (184 males/71 females) and 129 age-matched TD controls (75 males/54 females). A parent interview was used to assess GI symptoms (abdominal pain, gaseousness/bloating, diarrhea, constipation, pain on stooling, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, blood in stool or in vomit). Children with GI symptoms in each diagnostic group were compared to children without GI symptoms on measures of developmental, behavioral, and adaptive functioning. GI symptoms were reported more frequently in children with ASD compared to the TD group (47.8% vs. 17.8%, respectively). Children with ASD were also more likely to experience multiple GI symptoms (30.6% vs. 5.4%). GI symptoms were equally common in males and females across both diagnostic groups. There were no statistically significant differences in developmental or adaptive measures based on presence of GI symptoms in either ASD or TD children. Co-occurring GI symptoms were, however, associated with increased self-injurious behaviors, restricted stereotyped behaviors, aggressive behaviors, sleep problems and attention problems in both ASD and TD children. In children with ASD, a higher number of GI symptoms was associated with an increase in self-injurious behaviors, somatic complaints, reduced sleep duration, and increased parasomnias. LAY SUMMARY: ASD is characterized by challenges in social communication and repetitive behaviors. But, people with autism have many other difficulties including gastrointestinal problems. Children with ASD were three times more likely to experience GI symptoms than typically developing peers. Increased GI symptoms are associated with increased problem behaviors such as sleep problems, self-injury, and body aches. Since GI symptoms are often treatable, it is important to recognize them as soon as possible. Both clinicians and parents should become more aware of the high occurrence of GI problems in autistic people. Autism Res 2020, 13: 1778-1789.

The analyzed proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fbâˆ’1, were recorded at s = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The search utilizes the substructure of jets with large radius to identify quark pairs from Z boson decays. Backgrounds from standard model processes are suppressed by requirements on the jet mass and the missing transverse momentum. No significant excess in the event yield is observed beyond the number of background events expected from the standard model. For a simplified supersymmetric model in which the Z bosons arise from the decay of gluinos, an exclusion limit of 1920 GeV on the gluino mass is set at 95% confidence level. This is the first search for beyond-standard-model production of pairs of boosted Z bosons plus large missing transverse momentum. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"SKORUPSKI, Katherine A",Risk factors associated with progressive increases in serum creatinine concentrations in cats with cancer receiving doxorubicin.,"BackgroundAzotemia occurs in cats administered doxorubicin, but risk factors have not been explored.ObjectiveTo determine incidence of progressive increases in serum creatinine concentration in cats with cancer receiving doxorubicin in single or multiagent chemotherapy protocols and associated risk factors.AnimalsSeventy cats with cancer receiving doxorubicin.MethodsA retrospective study (2007-2017) of cats with indices of kidney function recorded before and after doxorubicin administration was reviewed. Cats diagnosed with kidney injury because of known etiologies other than possible doxorubicin toxicosis were excluded. Variables were compared to identify risk factors.ResultsMean age (Â±SD) was 10.9â€‰years (Â±3.2). Cancer types included lymphoma (n = 36), sarcoma (n = 19) and carcinoma (n = 14). Chronic kidney disease was present in 29/70 (41%) cats before receiving doxorubicin. Of 70 cats, 24 (34%) developed an increase in serum creatinine concentration â‰¥0.3 mg/dL and 10 (14%) had an increase â‰¥50% from baseline. Mean time to increases in serum creatinine concentration â‰¥0.3 mg/dL from first administration of doxorubicin was 119.3â€‰days (Â±89.7), with mean 2.8 (Â±1.2) doses administered. Neutropenia or anemia during chemotherapy and number of radiation therapy treatments under general anesthesia were risk factors for increases in serum creatinine concentration (Pâ€‰<â€‰.05). Cats receiving single agent doxorubicin had a higher likelihood of an increase in serum creatinine concentration â‰¥0.3 mg/dL from baseline than cats receiving CHOP-based chemotherapy protocols (OR 20.0, 95% CI 2.9-100).Conclusions and clinical importanceProgressive increases in serum creatinine concentration from baseline were common in cats receiving doxorubicin and associated risk factors were identified."
"OUTERBRIDGE, Catherine A",Open trial of Brutons tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PRN1008) in the treatment of canine pemphigus foliaceus.,"BACKGROUND: Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) is important in B-cell signalling. Efficacy has been reported for BTK inhibitors (BTKi) in human autoimmune diseases. Canine pemphigus foliaceus (cPF) is one of the most common canine autoimmune skin diseases. OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and efficacy of the BTKi PRN1008 in the treatment of cPF. ANIMALS: Four privately owned dogs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four dogs diagnosed with PF were administered BTKi PRN1008. Initial dosages approximated to 15&nbsp;mg/kg once daily, increased to twice daily if inadequate response was seen. Treatment continued for 20 weeks, attempting to decrease to every other day. Dogs were monitored with complete blood counts, serum biochemistry panels and urinalyses, and evaluated with a modified version of a validated human Pemphigus Disease Activity Index (cPDAI). Serum anti-desmocollin-1 (DSC-1) and desmoglein-1 (DSG-1) immunoglobulin (Ig)G titres were performed before and after the treatment period. Drug bound to target was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RESULTS: All four dogs showed reduction in lesions and cPDAI score during the first two weeks of treatment. Three dogs continued to improve and sustained near complete remission by 20 weeks, at which point three responses were considered good and one fair. Final daily dosages were in the range 17-33&nbsp;mg/kg. Anti-DSC-1 IgG titre decreased dramatically in one dog, was undetectable in two and was uninterpretable in one dog. No dogs had detectable IgG to DSG1. A possible adverse event occurred in one dog. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: BTKi PRN1008 monotherapy may have some beneficial effects in some cases of cPF."

The combination of patient and physician smiling at the end of the visit was associated with improvement in GERD symptoms (r2 = 0.45, p = 0.004). The physician in the integrative visits was more engaged (p = 0.009), friendly (p = 0.005), relaxed (p = 0.002), smiled longer (p = 0.006), gazed longer (p = 0.02), and gestured more (p = 0.007), compared to standard visits. Patients in integrative visits also smiled longer (p = 0.004).ConclusionThe expanded history-taking questions asked by integrative clinicians may enhance relationship building, modifying patients' responses and improving patient-centered behaviors from clinicians,ultimately facilitating symptom improvement.Practice implicationsAnalysis of nonverbal behaviors may facilitate a better understanding of patient-clinician interactions in integrative medicine visits and yield insights to improve clinical interactions in conventional medicine."

However, energy disorder arising from structural defects and aperiodicity has so far resulted in charge carrier localization and slow hopping transport. Detailed 3D structural characterization is critical for rationally improving epi-SL structural perfection to trigger the formation of mini-bands. Here, we analyze the 3D structure of a 120 Ã— 38 nm disc-shaped region of a PbSe QD epi-SL using full-tilt high-angle annular dark-field electron tomography. The high spatial resolution of the tomographic reconstruction (0.65 nm) enables determination of the center-of-mass coordinates of all 1846 QDs in the sample as well as the size and shape of the thousands of epitaxial connections (necks) between the QDs. The tomogram reveals the detailed crystallography and internal positional disorder of the three SL grains that constitute this sample. A map of the neck network is used to quantify relationships between neck number (the number of necks each QD possesses), average neck diameter, QD location in the film, and the nearest neighbor inter-QD distance and distance distribution. We find a strong positive correlation between neck number and local spatial order, suggesting that future improvements in neck connectivity are likely to simultaneously enhance the overall structural perfection of the epi-SLs. A kinetic Monte Carlo model is employed to estimate the electron mobility of the tomography sample and assess the impact of grain boundaries on charge transport. Our electron tomography study establishes a baseline for the quantitative statistical analysis of structural defects in 3D QD epi-SLs."

One of the major challenges is the lack of reliable dosimetry methods for dose prediction and dose verification. We present a patient-specific dosimetry approach for personalized treatment planning based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the microsphere transport combined with Y-90 physics modeling called CFDose. The ultimate goal is the development of a software to optimize the amount of activity and injection point for optimal tumor targeting. We present the proof-of-concept of a CFD dosimetry tool based on a patient's angiogram performed in standard-of-care planning. The hepatic arterial tree of the patient was segmented from the cone-beam CT (CBCT) to predict the microsphere transport using multiscale CFD modeling. To calculate the dose distribution, the predicted microsphere distribution was convolved with a Y-90 dose point kernel. Vessels as small as 0.45&nbsp;mm were segmented, the&nbsp;microsphere distribution between the liver segments using flow analysis was predicted,&nbsp;the volumetric microsphere and resulting dose distribution in the liver volume were computed. The patient was imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) 2&nbsp;h after radioembolization to evaluate the Y-90 distribution. The dose distribution was found to be consistent with the Y-90 PET images. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a complete framework for personalized Y-90 microsphere simulation and dosimetry using patient-specific input parameters."
"LANZARO, Gregory",Emergence of behavioural avoidance strategies of malaria vectors in areas of high LLIN coverage in Tanzania,"Despite significant reductions in malaria transmission across Africa since 2000, progress is stalling. This has been attributed to the development of insecticide resistance and behavioural adaptations in malaria vectors. Whilst insecticide resistance has been widely investigated, there is poorer understanding of the emergence, dynamics and impact of mosquito behavioural adaptations. We conducted a longitudinal investigation of malaria vector host choice over 3&nbsp;years and resting behaviour over 4&nbsp;years following a mass long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) distribution in Tanzania. By pairing observations of mosquito ecology with environmental monitoring, we quantified longitudinal shifts in host-choice and resting behaviour that are consistent with adaptation to evade LLINs. The density of An. funestus s.l., declined significantly through time. In tandem, An. arabiensis and An. funestus s.l. exhibited an increased rate of outdoor relative to indoor resting; with An. arabiensis reducing the proportion of blood meals taken from humans in favour of cattle. By accounting for environmental variation, this study detected clear evidence of intra-specific shifts in mosquito behaviour that could be obscured in shorter-term or temporally-coarse surveys. This highlights the importance of mosquito behavioural adaptations to vector control, and the value of longer-term behavioural studies."

To evaluate the effects of APOE genotype or diagnostic group on AÎ² positivity, we performed multivariate logistic regression analyses. Further distinctive underlying features of latent subgroups were examined by employing a latent class cluster analysis approach.ResultsIn comparison with Îµ3 homozygotes, in the ADCI group, Îµ2 carriers showed a lower frequency of AÎ² positivity (odds ratio [OR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.79), while in the SVCI group, Îµ2 carriers showed a higher frequency of AÎ² positivity (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.02-5.01). In particular, we observed an interaction effect of Îµ2 carrier status and diagnostic group on AÎ² positivity (OR 5.12, 95% CI 1.93-13.56), in that relative to Îµ3 homozygotes, there were more AÎ²-positive Îµ2 carriers in the SVCI group than in the ADCI group. We also identified latent subgroups of AÎ²-positive APOE Îµ2 carriers with SVCI and AÎ²-positive APOE Îµ4 carriers with ADCI.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that APOE Îµ2 is distinctly associated with AÎ² deposition in patients with SVCI and those with ADCI. Our findings further suggest that there is a distinctive subgroup of AÎ²-positive APOE Îµ2 carriers with SVCI among patients with cognitive impairment."

We used data from 3031 participants (including 190 ASD cases) from the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program to compare distributional properties and criterion validity of 16-item ""short"" to 65-item ""full"" SRS scores. Results demonstrated highly overlapping distributions of short and full scores. Both scores separated case from non-case individuals by approximately two standard deviations. ASD prediction was nearly identical for short and full scores (area under the curve values of 0.87, 0.86 respectively). Findings support comparability of shortened and full scores, suggesting opportunities to increase efficiency. Future work should confirm additional psychometric properties of short scores."
"ZAINI, Paulo","Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca Strains Fb7 and 9a5c from Citrus Display Differential Behavior, Secretome, and Plant Virulence","Xylella fastidiosa colonizes the xylem of various cultivated and native plants worldwide. Citrus production in Brazil has been seriously affected, and major commercial varieties remain susceptible to Citrus Variegated Chlorosis (CVC). Collective cellular behaviors such as biofilm formation influence virulence and insect transmission of X. fastidiosa. The reference strain 9a5c produces a robust biofilm compared to Fb7 that remains mostly planktonic, and both were isolated from symptomatic citrus trees. This work deepens our understanding of these distinct behaviors at the molecular level, by comparing the cellular and secreted proteomes of these two CVC strains. Out of 1017 identified proteins, 128 showed differential abundance between the two strains. Different protein families were represented such as proteases, hemolysin-like proteins, and lipase/esterases, among others. Here we show that the lipase/esterase LesA is among the most abundant secreted proteins of CVC strains as well, and demonstrate its functionality by complementary activity assays. More severe symptoms were observed in Nicotiana tabacum inoculated with strain Fb7 compared to 9a5c. Our results support that systemic symptom development can be accelerated by strains that invest less in biofilm formation and more in plant colonization. This has potential application in modulating the bacterial-plant interaction and reducing disease severity."

Additionally, our proposed practices are compared to the guidelines from the Foods Program Regulatory Subdivision of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and from the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology (ASVCP). The LTC suggestions are closely aligned with those from the OIE and comply with version 2021-01 of the AAVLD Requirements for an Accredited Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, although some LTC recommendations are more stringent and extend beyond the AAVLD requirements. LTC suggested guidelines are substantially different than the guidelines recently published by the U.S. FDA for validation and modification of regulated tests used for detection of pathogens in pet food and animal-derived products, such as dairy. Veterinary diagnostic laboratories that perform assays from the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Method (BAM) manual must be aware of the different standard."
"TEH, Swee J",The health and condition responses of Delta Smelt to fasting: A time series experiment.,"There is an extensive literature establishing, validating, and quantifying a wide range of responses of fishes to fasting. Our study complements this work by comparing fed and unfed treatments of hatchery-raised Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus)-an imperiled fish that is endemic to the San Francisco Estuary and its tributaries in California, USA-across a diverse suite of endpoints over a two-month time series. The experiment was conducted at 15.9Â°C, and individuals were sampled at 12 time points as starvation became increasingly severe. We found that hepatosomatic index and condition factor were relatively sensitive to starvation, becoming significantly depressed at Day 4 and 7, respectively. Histological analysis of liver showed elevated cytoplasmic inclusion bodies at Day 7, followed by increased glycogen depletion, single cell necrosis, and hydropic vacuolar degeneration at Day 14, 21, and 28, respectively. Of four antioxidants measured, glutathione decreased at Day 4, superoxide dismutase increased at Day 14, catalase increased at Day 56, and glutathione peroxidase was not affected by starvation. The net result was a ~2-fold increase in lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) in fasted fish that was highly inconsistent through time. RNA to DNA ratio and triglycerides in muscle were relatively insensitive to starvation, only consistently decreasing with fasting after mortality began increasing in the 'No Feeding' treatment, at Day 21. Together, these results suggest that Delta Smelt mobilize hepatic energy stores far more rapidly than lipids in muscle when subjected to fasting, leading to rapid atrophy of liver and the development of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies-possibly autophagosomes-in hepatocytes."
"MUNAKATA, Yuko",Developing adaptive control: Age-related differences in task choices and awareness of proactive and reactive control demands,"Developmental changes in executive function are often explained in terms of core cognitive processes and associated neural substrates. For example, younger children tend to engage control reactively in the moment as needed, whereas older children increasingly engage control proactively, in anticipation of needing it. Such developments may reflect increasing capacities for active maintenance dependent upon dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, younger children will engage proactive control when reactive control is made more difficult, suggesting that developmental changes may also reflect decisions about whether to engage control, and how. We tested awareness of temporal control demands and associated task choices in 5-year-olds and 10-year-olds and adults using a demand selection task. Participants chose between one task that enabled proactive control and another task that enabled reactive control. Adults reported awareness of these different control demands and preferentially played the proactive task option. Ten-year-olds reported awareness of control demands but selected task options at chance. Five-year-olds showed neither awareness nor task preference, but a subsample who exhibited awareness of control demands preferentially played the reactive task option, mirroring their typical control mode. Thus, developmental improvements in executive function may in part reflect better awareness of cognitive demands and adaptive behavior, which may in turn reflect changes in dorsal anterior cingulate in signaling task demands to lateral prefrontal cortex."
"BLISS-MOREAU, Eliza",Animal models of human mood.,"Humans everyday experience of the world is influenced by our moods. Moods are consciously accessible affective states that extend over time that are characterized by their valence and arousal. They also likely have a long evolutionary heritage and serve as an important adaptive affective mechanism. When they become maladaptive or overly biased, pathological affective states such as depression can emerge. Despite the importance of moods for human experience, little is known about their causal neurobiological mechanisms. In humans, limitations related to methods and interpretations of the data prevent causal investigations into the origins of mood, highlighting the importance of animal models. Nonhuman primates that share key neuroanatomical, affective, and social features with humans will be essential to uncovering their foundation. Identifying and validating mood-like states in animals is, however, challenging not least because mood is a human construct requiring verbal communication. Here we outline a theoretical framework for animal models of human mood, drawing upon established psychological literature where it exists before reviewing the extant studies of non-human primate models of mood-like states."
"GREEN, Ralph","Knowledge gaps in understanding the metabolic and clinical effects of excess folates/folic acid: a summary, and perspectives, from an NIH workshop","Folate, an essential nutrient found naturally in foods in a reduced form, is present in dietary supplements and fortified foods in an oxidized synthetic form (folic acid). There is widespread agreement that maintaining adequate folate status is critical to prevent diseases due to folate inadequacy (e.g., anemia, birth defects, and cancer). However, there are concerns of potential adverse effects of excess folic acid intake and/or elevated folate status, with the original concern focused on exacerbation of clinical effects of vitamin B-12 deficiency and its role in neurocognitive health. More recently, animal and observational studies have suggested potential adverse effects on cancer risk, birth outcomes, and other diseases. Observations indicating adverse effects from excess folic acid intake, elevated folate status, and unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) remain inconclusive; the data do not provide the evidence needed to affect public health recommendations. Moreover, strong biological and mechanistic premises connecting elevated folic acid intake, UMFA, and/or high folate status to adverse health outcomes are lacking. However, the body of evidence on potential adverse health outcomes indicates the need for comprehensive research to clarify these issues and bridge knowledge gaps. Three key research questions encompass the additional research needed to establish whether high folic acid or total folate intake contributes to disease risk. 1) Does UMFA affect biological pathways leading to adverse health effects? 2) Does elevated folate status resulting from any form of folate intake affect vitamin B-12 function and its roles in sustaining health? 3) Does elevated folate intake, regardless of form, affect biological pathways leading to adverse health effects other than those linked to vitamin B-12 function? This article summarizes the proceedings of an August 2019 NIH expert workshop focused on addressing these research areas."

Although ML single-unit responses have been studied for several auditory stimuli, the ability of ML cells to encode amplitude modulation (AM)-an ability that has been widely studied in A1-has not yet been characterized. Here, we compared the responses of A1 and ML neurons to amplitude-modulated (AM) noise in awake macaques. Although several of the basic properties of A1 and ML responses to AM noise were similar, we found several key differences. ML neurons were less likely to phase lock, did not phase lock as strongly, and were more likely to respond in a nonsynchronized fashion than A1 cells, consistent with a temporal-to-rate transformation as information ascends the auditory hierarchy. ML neurons tended to have lower temporally (phase-locking) based best modulation frequencies than A1 neurons. Neurons that decreased their firing rate in response to AM noise relative to their firing rate in response to unmodulated noise became more common at the level of ML than they were in A1. In both A1 and ML, we found a prevalent class of neurons that usually have enhanced rate responses relative to responses to the unmodulated noise at lower modulation frequencies and suppressed rate responses relative to responses to the unmodulated noise at middle modulation frequencies.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY ML neurons synchronized less than A1 neurons, consistent with a hierarchical temporal-to-rate transformation. Both A1 and ML had a class of modulation transfer functions previously unreported in the cortex with a low-modulation-frequency (MF) peak, a middle-MF trough, and responses similar to unmodulated noise responses at high MFs. The results support a hierarchical shift toward a two-pool opponent code, where subtraction of neural activity between two populations of oppositely tuned neurons encodes AM."

"ALY, Sharif S",Effect of continued metabolic acidification into the first 3 days of lactation on blood calcium status in postpartum dairy cattle: A randomized controlled trial,"Although incidence of clinical hypocalcemia in postpartum dairy cows is low in US dairies, subclinical hypocalcemia after calving is common and has been associated with metabolic and infectious disease. It is widespread farm practice to feed a diet rich in anions to prepartum dairy cattle to support calcium homeostasis. However, this diet is typically discontinued at parturition, when calcium needs are still high. The objective of this trial was to determine the effects of extending metabolic acidification into the first 3 d of lactation in multiparous Holstein cows with the use of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) hexahydrate drenches on blood ionized calcium concentrations. Adult Holstein cows at a commercial dairy in their second or higher lactation, with a urine pH of 6.8 or less on the day of calving, were randomly assigned to either treatment or control groups, resulting in 13 cows in the treatment group and 14 cows in the control group. Treatment cows received 480 g of oral MgCl2 hexahydrate once daily for 3 d for continued acidification starting on the day of calving, whereas cows in the control group received no treatment. Urine pH was measured daily for 5 d, starting on the day of calving (0 DIM), to assess acidification status; blood was collected on day of calving (0 DIM), 2 DIM, and 4 DIM and analyzed for ionized calcium concentrations. Differences in blood ionized calcium and urine pH over time were compared using longitudinal data analysis. Urine pH was lower in treatment cows compared with control cows at 1, 2, and 3 DIM. Blood ionized calcium concentrations were different from baseline, taken at enrollment (0 DIM) and at 2 and 4 DIM in both treatment and control cows. However, no difference was detectable between treatment and control cows at 2 or 4 DIM with respect to blood ionized calcium concentrations. Oral supplementation with MgCl2 hexahydrate resulted in the desired acidification of urine pH in the treatment group, similar to feeding of an anionic close-up diet. Continued acidification of dairy cows until 2 DIM did not result in clinically meaningful higher blood calcium concentrations compared with controls, and further research is needed, to identify physiological reasons for this finding."
"GALANTE, Joseph M",Quantifying the need for pediatric REBOA: A gap analysis,"BackgroundTrauma is the leading cause of death in children. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) provides temporary hemorrhage control, but its potential benefit has not been assessed in children. We hypothesized that there are pediatric patients who may benefit from REBOA.MethodsTrauma patients <18â€¯years old at a level 1 pediatric trauma center between 2009 and 2019 were queried for deaths, pre-hospital cardiac arrest, massive transfusion protocol activation, transfusion requirement, or hemorrhage control surgery. These patients defined the cohort of severely injured patients. From this cohort, patients with intraabdominal injuries for which REBOA may provide temporary hemorrhage control were identified, including solid organ injury necessitating intervention, vascular injury, or pelvic hemorrhage.ResultsThere were 239 severely injured patients out of 6538 pediatric traumas. Of these, 38 had REBOA-amenable injuries (15.9%) with 34.2% mortality, accounting for 10.2% of all pediatric trauma deaths at one center. Eleven patients with REBOA-amenable injuries had TBI (28.9%). Patients with REBOA-amenable injuries represented 0.6% of all pediatric traumas.ConclusionNearly 20% of severely injured pediatric patients could potentially benefit from REBOA. The overall proportion of pediatric patients with REBOA-amenable injuries is similar to adult studies.Type of studyRetrospective comparative study.Level of evidenceLevel III."

Elevations in extracellular glucose (hyperglycemia) potentiate vascular L-type Ca2+ channel via PKA, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we find that cAMP synthesis in response to elevated glucose and the selective P2Y11 agonist NF546 is blocked by disruption of A-kinase anchoring protein 5 (AKAP5) function in arterial myocytes. Glucose and NF546-induced potentiation of L-type Ca2+ channels, vasoconstriction and decreased blood flow are prevented in AKAP5 null arterial myocytes/arteries. These responses are nucleated via the AKAP5-dependent clustering of P2Y11/ P2Y11-like receptors, AC5, PKA and CaV1.2 into nanocomplexes at the plasma membrane of human and mouse arterial myocytes. Hence, data reveal an AKAP5 signaling module that regulates L-type Ca2+ channel activity and vascular reactivity upon elevated glucose. This AKAP5-anchored nanocomplex may contribute to vascular complications during diabetic hyperglycemia."
"FOLEY, Janet E",Concentrations of Retinol and Î±-Tocopherol in Tissue Samples From Anna's Hummingbirds (Calypte anna).,"Retinol (vitamin A) and Î±-tocopherol (vitamin E) concentrations were measured in tissue samples (liver, heart, pectoral muscle, and brain) from Anna's Hummingbirds (Calypte anna). Hummingbirds were after-hatch year birds that were sourced from various rehabilitation centers throughout California. Tissues samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation (SD), and median ppm concentrations were calculated for each vitamin and tissue sample type. A novel analytical method was developed to analyze small mass tissue samples, with the smallest sample mass being 0.05 g for which analysis can be performed. Mean Â± standard deviation (SD) concentrations of retinol in hummingbird livers, hearts, and pectoral muscle samples were 269.0 Â± 216.9 ppm, 1.8 Â± 2.2 ppm, and 0.3 Â± 0.1 ppm, respectively. Mean Â± SD Î±-tocopherol concentrations were 6.9 Â± 4.6 ppm, 5.5 Â± 4.0 ppm, 3.7 Â± 2.2 ppm, and 9.1 Â± 3.2 ppm for liver, heart, pectoral muscle, and brain samples, respectively. Vitamin concentrations from varying tissue types were compared to determine which were best associated with liver concentrations, the most commonly analyzed tissue for these vitamins. For both retinol and Î±-tocopherol, heart samples were most strongly associated with the liver samples. The results of this study provide baseline retinol and Î±-tocopherol concentrations in different tissue types from Anna's hummingbirds. These baseline values may be utilized in conservation efforts to avoid hypervitaminosis and hypovitaminosis of rehabilitated and/or captive hummingbirds by providing guidelines for nutritional targets which could be assessed on post-mortem examinations. Post-mortem examination of birds and measurement of vitamin concentrations in tissues may allow for dietary changes that aid captive hummingbirds."

"WEXLER, Anthony",Quantification of toxic metals using machine learning techniques and spark emission spectroscopy,"The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) list of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) includes toxic metal suspected or associated with development of cancer. Traditional techniques for detecting and quantifying toxic metals in the atmosphere are either not real time, hindering identification of sources, or limited by instrument costs. Spark emission spectroscopy is a promising and cost-effective technique that can be used for analyzing toxic metals in real time. Here, we have developed a cost-effective spark emission spectroscopy system to quantify the concentration of toxic metals targeted by the US EPA. Specifically, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb solutions were diluted and deposited on the ground electrode of the spark emission system. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was optimized and employed to detect useful features from the spark-generated plasma emissions. The optimized model was able to detect atomic emission lines along with other features to build a regression model that predicts the concentration of toxic metals from the observed spectra. The limits of detections (LODs) were estimated using the detected features and compared to the traditional single-feature approach. LASSO is capable of detecting highly sensitive features in the input spectrum; however, for some toxic metals the single-feature LOD marginally outperforms LASSO LOD. The combination of low-cost instruments with advanced machine learning techniques for data analysis could pave the path forward for data-driven solutions to costly measurements."
"WULFF, Heike",A non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analogue with therapeutic potential,"The psychedelic alkaloid ibogaine has anti-addictive properties in both humans and animals1. Unlike most medications for the treatment of substance use disorders, anecdotal reports suggest that ibogaine has the potential to treat addiction to various substances, including opiates, alcohol and psychostimulants. The effects of ibogaine-like those of other psychedelic compounds-are long-lasting2, which has been attributed to its ability to modify addiction-related neural circuitry through the activation of neurotrophic factor signalling3,4. However, several safety concerns have hindered the clinical development of ibogaine, including its toxicity, hallucinogenic potential and tendency to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Here we apply the principles of function-oriented synthesis to identify the key structural elements of the potential therapeutic pharmacophore of ibogaine, and we use this information to engineer tabernanthalog-a water-soluble, non-hallucinogenic, non-toxic analogue of ibogaine that can be prepared in a single step. In rodents, tabernanthalog was found to promote structural neural plasticity, reduce alcohol- and heroin-seeking behaviour, and produce antidepressant-like effects. This work demonstrates that, through careful chemical design, it is possible to modify a psychedelic compound to produce a safer, non-hallucinogenic variant that has therapeutic potential."

On December 10, 2019, we facilitated a change in the default orders for dispensing self-administered hormonal contraceptives from one-month to 12-months. We evaluated the primary outcome of 12-month supply prescriptions during the four months before and after the change. We also compared 12-month supply prescriptions for pills, patch, and ring by prescriber specialty and location.ResultsThe dataset included 4897 distinct evaluable prescriptions for the pill, patch, or ring, with an overall increase in 12-month prescriptions from 260/2437 (10.7%) to 669/2460 (27.2%) after the order change (p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001). Twelve-month pill prescriptions increased from 238/2250 (10.6%) to 607/2250 (27.0%) (p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001), patch prescriptions from 6/40 (15.0%) to 21/44 (47.7%) (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.002), and ring prescriptions from 16/147 (10.9%) to 41/165 (24.8%) (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.001). Twelve-month prescriptions increased after the order change among all provider types at the medical center campus (194/594 [32.7%] to 329/623 [52.8%], p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001). At community clinics, non-obstetrics/gynecology providers increased 12-month prescriptions after the order change (58/1616 [3.6%] to 327/1612 [20.3%], p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001), but obstetrics/gynecology providers did not (8/227 [3.5%] to 13/225 [5.8%], p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.27).ConclusionProviders more frequently prescribed a 12-month supply of contraceptive pills, patches, and rings after a change in the default dispensing quantity in electronic medical record orders.ImplicationsInstitution-wide changes to the electronic medical record default facility order settings can increase 12-month supply contraceptive prescriptions. As a 12-month prescription order represents only one step of many in obtaining a 12-month contraception supply, additional research is required to elucidate and remove other potential barriers."

In addition, PPARÎ²/Î´-overexpressed HepG2 cells had reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities accompanied by increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Moreover, differential gene expression profiling uncovered that the levels of serine/threonine-protein kinase (SGK-1) mRNA and its encoded protein were reduced in PPARÎ²/Î´-overexpressed HepG2 cells. Consistently, elevated SGK-1 levels were found in PPARÎ²/Î´ (-/-) mouse livers as well as PPARÎ²/Î´-knockdown human SMMC-7721 HCC cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays followed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays further revealed the binding of PPARÎ²/Î´ to the SGK-1 regulatory region in HepG2 cells.ConclusionsDue to the known tumor-promoting effect of SGK1, the present data suggest that PPARÎ²/Î´-deactivated SGK1 is a novel pathway for inhibiting liver carcinogenesis."

These situations arise in biological systems where dispersal processes are prevalent and the fishery prior to reserve creation is operating at effort levels in a neighborhood of open-access levels. We also illustrate th at using strictly biological criteria for siting reserves (e.g., setting aside the most biological productive areas) will likely induce the most vociferous objections from the fishing industry. In general, we find th at the dispersal rate and the degree the patches are connected play a significant role on the net impacts on the fishing sector."
"KOL, Amir",Loss of sympathetic innervation to islets of Langerhans in canine diabetes and pancreatitis is not associated with insulitis,"Canine diabetes mellitus (DM) affects 0.6% of the canine population and yet, its etiology is poorly understood. Most affected dogs are diagnosed as adults and are insulin-dependent. We compared pan-leukocyte and sympathetic innervation markers in pancreatic islets of adult dogs with spontaneous DM (sDM), spontaneous pancreatitis (sPanc), both (sDMPanc), toxin-induced DM (iDM) and controls. We found evidence of decreased islet sympathetic innervation but no significant infiltration of islets with leukocytes in all disease groups. We show that loss of sympathetic innervation is ongoing in canine DM and does not necessarily precede it. We further found selective loss of islet-associated beta cells in dogs with sDM and sDMPanc, suggesting that collateral damage from inflammation in the exocrine pancreas is not a likely cause of DM in these dogs. The cause of this selective loss of beta cells needs to be further elucidated but overall, our findings are not supportive of an autoimmune process as a cause of sDM in adult dogs. The loss of sympathetic innervation in sPanc in dogs that do not suffer from DM links the disease in the exocrine pancreas to a pathological process in the endocrine pancreas, suggesting pancreatitis might be a potential precursor to DM."
"HEYER, Wolf D","Bisulfite treatment and single-molecule real-time sequencing reveals D-loop length, position and distribution","Displacement loops (D-loops) are signature intermediates formed during homologous recombination. Numerous factors regulate D-loop formation and disruption, thereby influencing crucial aspects of DNA repair, including donor choice and the possibility of crossover outcome. While D-loop detection methods exist, it is currently unfeasible to assess the relationship between D-loop editors and D-loop characteristics such as length and position. Here, we developed a novel in vitro assay to characterize the length and position of individual D-loops with near base-pair resolution and deep coverage, while also revealing their distribution in a population. Non-denaturing bisulfite treatment modifies the cytosines on the displaced strand of the D-loop to uracil, leaving a permanent signature for the displaced strand. Subsequent single-molecule real-time sequencing uncovers the cytosine conversion patch as a D-loop footprint. The D-loop Mapping Assay is widely applicable with different substrates and donor types and can be used to study factors that influence D-loop properties."
"ESKALEN, Akif",Phylogenomic Analysis of a 55.1-kb 19-Gene Dataset Resolves a Monophyletic Fusarium that Includes the Fusarium solani Species Complex.,"Scientific communication is facilitated by a data-driven, scientifically sound taxonomy that considers the end-user's needs and established successful practice. In 2013, the Fusarium community voiced near unanimous support for a concept of Fusarium that represented a clade comprising all agriculturally and clinically important Fusarium species, including the F. solani species complex (FSSC). Subsequently, this concept was challenged in 2015 by one research group who proposed dividing the genus Fusarium into seven genera, including the FSSC described as members of the genus Neocosmospora, with subsequent justification in 2018 based on claims that the 2013 concept of Fusarium is polyphyletic. Here, we test this claim and provide a phylogeny based on exonic nucleotide sequences of 19 orthologous protein-coding genes that strongly support the monophyly of Fusarium including the FSSC. We reassert the practical and scientific argument in support of a genus Fusarium that includes the FSSC and several other basal lineages, consistent with the longstanding use of this name among plant pathologists, medical mycologists, quarantine officials, regulatory agencies, students, and researchers with a stake in its taxonomy. In recognition of this monophyly, 40 species described as genus Neocosmospora were recombined in genus Fusarium, and nine others were renamed Fusarium.

Woody species are inherently slow maturing, meaning that seeders are confined to infrequent fire regimes. However, for grasses, which mature faster, the relationships between persistence strategy and fire regime remain unknown. Globally, we analysed associations between fire regimes experienced by hundreds of grass species and their persistence strategy, within a phylogenetic context. We also tested whether persistence strategies are associated with morphological and physiological traits. Resprouters were associated with less frequent fire than seeders. Whilst modal fire frequencies were similar (fire return interval of 4-6&nbsp;yr), seeders were restricted to regions with more frequent fire than resprouters, suggesting that greater competition with long-lived resprouters restricts seeder recruitment and survival when fire is rare. Resprouting was associated with lower leaf N, higher C:N ratios and the presence of belowground buds, but was unrelated to photosynthetic pathway. Differences between the life histories of grasses and woody species led to a contrasting prevalence of seeders and resprouters in relation to fire frequency. Rapid sexual maturation in grasses means that seeder distributions, relative to fire regime, are determined by competitive ability and recruitment, rather than time to reproductive maturity."
"ULLRICH, Paul A",Sensitivity of Atmospheric River Vapor Transport and Precipitation to Uniform Sea Surface Temperature Increases,"Filaments of intense vapor transport called atmospheric rivers (ARs) are responsible for the majority of poleward vapor transport in the midlatitudes. Despite their importance to the hydrologic cycle, there remain many unanswered questions about changes to ARs in a warming climate. In this study we perform a series of escalating uniform SST increases (+2, +4, and +6K, respectively) in the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 in an aquaplanet configuration to evaluate the thermodynamic and dynamical response of AR vapor content, transport, and precipitation to warming SSTs. We find that AR column integrated water vapor (IWV) is especially sensitive to SST and increases by 6.3-9.7% per degree warming despite decreasing relative humidity through much of the column. Further analysis provides a more nuanced view of AR IWV changes: Since SST warming is modest compared to that in the midtroposphere, computing fractional changes in IWV with respect to SST results in finding spuriously large increases. Meanwhile, results here show that AR IWV transport increases relatively uniformly with temperature and at consistently lower rates than IWV, as modulated by systematically decreasing low-level wind speeds. Similarly, changes in AR precipitation are related to a compensatory relationship between enhanced near-surface moisture and damped vertical motions."

"MASSONNET, Melanie",Xylella fastidiosa causes transcriptional shifts that precede tylose formation and starch depletion in xylem.,"Pierce's disease (PD) in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is caused by the bacterial pathogen Xylella fastidiosa. X. fastidiosa is limited to the xylem tissue and following infection induces extensive plant-derived xylem blockages, primarily in the form of tyloses. Tylose-mediated vessel occlusions are a hallmark of PD, particularly in susceptible V.&nbsp;vinifera. We temporally monitored tylose development over the course of the disease to link symptom severity to the level of tylose occlusion and the presence/absence of the bacterial pathogen at fine-scale resolution. The majority of vessels containing tyloses were devoid of bacterial cells, indicating that direct, localized perception of X.&nbsp;fastidiosa was not a primary cause of tylose formation. In addition, we used X-ray computed microtomography and machine-learning to determine that X.&nbsp;fastidiosa induces significant starch depletion in xylem ray parenchyma cells. This suggests that a signalling mechanism emanating from the vessels colonized by bacteria enables a systemic response to X.&nbsp;fastidiosa infection. To understand the transcriptional changes underlying these phenotypes, we integrated global transcriptomics into the phenotypes we tracked over the disease spectrum. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that considerable transcriptomic reprogramming occurred during early PD before symptom appearance. Specifically, we determined that many genes associated with tylose formation (ethylene signalling and cell wall biogenesis) and drought stress were up-regulated during both Phase I and Phase II of PD. On the contrary, several genes related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation were down-regulated during both phases. These responses correlate with significant starch depletion observed in ray cells and tylose synthesis in vessels."
"ROGERS, Crystal D",Cadherin-11 Is Required for Neural Crest Specification and Survival,"Neural crest (NC) cells are multipotent embryonic cells that form melanocytes, craniofacial bone and cartilage, and the peripheral nervous system in vertebrates. NC cells express many cadherin proteins, which control their specification, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Abnormal NC development leads to congenital defects including craniofacial clefts as well as NC-derived cancers. Here, we identify the role of the type II cadherin protein, Cadherin-11 (CDH11), in early chicken NC development. CDH11 is known to play a role in NC cell migration in amphibian embryos as well as cell survival, proliferation, and migration in cancer cells. It has also been linked to the complex neurocristopathy disorder, Elsahy-Waters Syndrome, in humans. In this study, we knocked down CDH11 translation at the onset of its expression in the NC domain during NC induction. Loss of CDH11 led to a reduction of bonafide NC cells in the dorsal neural tube combined with defects in cell survival and migration. Loss of CDH11 increased p53-mediated programmed-cell death, and blocking the p53 pathway rescued the NC phenotype. Our findings reveal an early requirement for CDH11 in NC development and demonstrated the complexity of the mechanisms that regulate NC development, where a single cell-cell adhesion protein simultaneous controls multiple essential cellular functions to ensure proper specification, survival, and transition to a migratory phase in the dorsal neural tube. Our findings may also increase our understanding of early cadherin-related NC developmental defects."
"LIU, Kai",Voltage-driven motion of nitrogen ions: a new paradigm for magneto-ionics,"Magneto-ionics, understood as voltage-driven ion transport in magnetic materials, has largely relied on controlled migration of oxygen ions. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature voltage-driven nitrogen transport (i.e., nitrogen magneto-ionics) by electrolyte-gating of a CoN film. Nitrogen magneto-ionics in CoN is compared to oxygen magneto-ionics in Co3O4. Both materials are nanocrystalline (face-centered cubic structure) and show reversible voltage-driven ON-OFF ferromagnetism. In contrast to oxygen, nitrogen transport occurs uniformly creating a plane-wave-like migration front, without assistance of diffusion channels. Remarkably, nitrogen magneto-ionics requires lower threshold voltages and exhibits enhanced rates and cyclability. This is due to the lower activation energy for ion diffusion and the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen. These results may open new avenues in applications such as brain-inspired computing or iontronics in general."
"HUSSAIN, Shehnaz K",Effect of Statin Use on Inflammation and Immune Activation Biomarkers in HIV-Infected Persons on Effective Antiretroviral Therapy,"Immune activation and inflammation are hallmarks of chronic HIV infection and are etiologically linked to major causes of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected persons, including coronary artery disease and cancer. Systemic immune activation is dampened, but not resolved, with use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Statins are cardioprotective drugs that also appear to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. We sought to understand the association between statin use, cART, and levels of circulating immune markers in a longitudinal cohort study. From 2004 to 2009, statin use was ascertained in male participants of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) using interviewer-administered questionnaires. Twenty-four circulating markers of immune activation and inflammation were measured in archived serial samples from a subset of cohort members using multiplex assays. Propensity-adjusted generalized gamma models were used to compare biomarkers' distributions by statin use, and multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the effect of initiating statin on these biomarkers. Overall, 1,031 cART-exposed individuals with HIV infection were included in this study. Statin use was reported by 31.5% of cART-exposed participants. Compared to nonstatin users on cART, statin users on cART had lower levels of IP-10, IL-10, and IL-12p70, and the effect of statin use was decreased in participants using lipophilic statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, or lovastatin); these results were statistically significant (pâ€‰<â€‰.05). Among cART users not on aspirin, starting statins decreased levels of high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP), IL-12p70, and IL-6. Statin therapy is associated with reduced levels of certain biomarkers of immune activation and inflammation in cART users, which may contribute to a lower burden of disease."
"DRAKE, Christiana M",Obesity Risk Assessment Tool for Low-Income Spanish Speaking Immigrant Parents with Young Children: Validity with BMI and Biomarkers of Obesity.,"Children of Hispanic origin bear a high risk of obesity. Child weight gain trajectories are influenced by the family environment, including parent feeding practices. Excessive body fat can result in unhealthful metabolic and lipid profiles and increased risk of metabolic diseases. The objective was to estimate criterion validity of an obesity risk assessment tool targeting Spanish-speaking families of Mexican origin using anthropometric measures and blood values of their young children. A cross-sectional study design with five data collection sessions was conducted over an eight-week period and involved 206 parent/child dyads recruited at Head Start and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children in Northern California. Main outcome measures were criterion validity of NiÃ±os Sanos, a pediatric obesity risk assessment tool, using anthropometric measures and blood biomarkers. NiÃ±os Sanos scores were inversely related to child BMI-for-age percentiles (p = 0.02), waist-for-height ratios (p = 0.05) and inversely related to blood biomarkers for the metabolic index (p = 0.03) and lipid index (p = 0.05) and positively related to anti-inflammatory index (p = 0.047). Overall, children with higher NiÃ±os Sanos scores had more healthful lipid, metabolic and inflammatory profiles, as well as lower BMI-for-age percentiles and waist-to height ratios, providing evidence for the criterion validity of the tool. NiÃ±os Sanos can be used by child obesity researchers, by counselors and medical professionals during clinic visits as a screening tool and by educators as a tool to set goals for behavior change."
"MCDONALD, Craig M",Multi-Omics Identifies Circulating miRNA and Protein Biomarkers for Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy.,"The development of therapeutics for muscle diseases such as facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is impeded by a lack of objective, minimally invasive biomarkers. Here we identify circulating miRNAs and proteins that are dysregulated in early-onset FSHD patients to develop blood-based molecular biomarkers. Plasma samples from clinically characterized individuals with early-onset FSHD provide a discovery group and are compared to healthy control volunteers. Low-density quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based arrays identify 19 candidate miRNAs, while mass spectrometry proteomic analysis identifies 13 candidate proteins. Bioinformatic analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq data shows that the FSHD-dysregulated DUX4 transcription factor binds to regulatory regions of several candidate miRNAs. This panel of miRNAs also shows ChIP signatures consistent with regulation by additional transcription factors which are up-regulated in FSHD (FOS, EGR1, MYC, and YY1). Validation studies in a separate group of patients with FSHD show consistent up-regulation of miR-100, miR-103, miR-146b, miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-454, miR-505, and miR-576. An increase in the expression of S100A8 protein, an inflammatory regulatory factor and subunit of calprotectin, is validated by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Bioinformatic analyses of proteomics and miRNA data further support a model of calprotectin and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway dysregulation in FSHD. Moving forward, this panel of miRNAs, along with S100A8 and calprotectin, merit further investigation as monitoring and pharmacodynamic biomarkers for FSHD."
"HENRY, Stephen G",Changes in opioid prescribing after implementation of mandatory registration and proactive reports within Californiaâ€™s prescription drug monitoring program,"BackgroundIn 2016, California updated its prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), adding two key features: automated proactive reports to prescribers and mandatory registration for prescribers and pharmacists. The effects of these changes on prescribing patterns have not yet been examined. We aimed to evaluate the joint effect of these two PDMP features on county-level prescribing practices in California.MethodsUsing county-level quarterly data from 2012 to 2017, we estimated the absolute change associated with the implementation of these two PDMP features in seven prescribing indicators in California versus a control group comprising counties in Florida and Washington: opioid prescription rate per 1000 residents; patients' mean daily opioid dosage in milligrams of morphine equivalents[MME]; prescribers' mean daily MME prescribed; prescribers' mean number of opioid prescriptions per day; percentage of patients getting >90 MME/day; percentage of days with overlapping prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines; multiple opioid provider episodes per 100,000 residents.ResultsProactive reports and mandatory registration were associated with a 7.7 MME decrease in patients' mean daily opioid dose (95 %CI: -11.4, -2.9); a 1.8 decrease in the percentage of patients prescribed high-dose opioids (95 %CI: -2.3, -0.9); and a 6.3 MME decrease in prescribers' mean daily dose prescribed (95 %CI: -10.0, -1.3).ConclusionsCalifornia's implementation of these two PDMP features was associated with decreases in the total quantity of opioid MMEs prescribed, and indicators of patients prescribed high-dose opioids compared to states that had PDMP's without these features. Rates of opioid prescribing and other high-risk prescribing patterns remained unchanged."
"KOL, Amir",Chromatin accessibility in canine stromal cells and its implications for canine somatic cell reprogramming,"Naturally occurring disease in pet dogs is an untapped and unique resource for stem cell-based regenerative medicine translational research, given the many similarities and complexity such disease shares with their human counterparts. Canine-specific regulators of somatic cell reprogramming and pluripotency maintenance are poorly understood. While retroviral delivery of the four Yamanaka factors successfully reprogrammed canine embryonic fibroblasts, adult stromal cells remained resistant to reprogramming in spite of effective viral transduction and transgene expression. We hypothesized that adult stromal cells fail to reprogram due to an epigenetic barrier. Here, we performed assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) on canine stromal and pluripotent stem cells, analyzing 51 samples in total, and establishing the global landscape of chromatin accessibility before and after reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). We also studied adult stromal cells that do not yield iPSC colonies to identify potential reprogramming barriers. ATAC-seq analysis identified distinct cell type clustering patterns and chromatin remodeling during embryonic fibroblast reprogramming. Compared with embryonic fibroblasts, adult stromal cells had a chromatin accessibility landscape that reflects phenotypic differentiation and somatic cell-fate stability. We ultimately identified 76 candidate genes and several transcription factor binding motifs that may be impeding somatic cell reprogramming to iPSC, and could be targeted for inhibition or activation, in order to improve the process in canines. These results provide a vast resource for better understanding of pluripotency regulators in dogs and provide an unbiased rationale for novel canine-specific reprogramming approaches."

Pellicle Tissues Reveals the Regulation of Nut Quality Attributes,"Walnuts (Juglans regia L.) are a valuable dietary source of polyphenols and lipids, with increasing worldwide consumption. California is a major producer, with 'Chandler' and 'Tulare' among the cultivars more widely grown. 'Chandler' produces kernels with extra light color at a higher frequency than other cultivars, gaining preference by growers and consumers. Here we performed a deep comparative proteome analysis of kernel pellicle tissue from these two valued genotypes at three harvest maturities, detecting a total of 4937 J. regia proteins. Late and early maturity stages were compared for each cultivar, revealing many developmental responses common or specific for each cultivar. Top protein biomarkers for each developmental stage were also selected based on larger fold-change differences and lower variance among replicates, including proteins for biosynthesis of lipids and phenols, defense-related proteins and desiccation stress-related proteins. Comparison between the genotypes also revealed the common and specific protein repertoires, totaling 321 pellicle proteins with differential abundance at harvest stage. The proteomics data provides clues on antioxidant, secondary, and hormonal metabolism that could be involved in the loss of quality in the pellicles during processing for commercialization."

"ANGELASTRO, James M",Novel mTORC1 Inhibitors Kill Glioblastoma Stem Cells,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive tumor of the brain, with an average post-diagnosis survival of 15 months. GBM stem cells (GBMSC) resist the standard-of-care therapy, temozolomide, and are considered a major contributor to tumor resistance. Mammalian target of rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates cell proliferation and has been shown by others to have reduced activity in GBMSC. We recently identified a novel chemical series of human-safe piperazine-based brain-penetrant mTORC1-specific inhibitors. We assayed the piperazine-mTOR binding strength by two biophysical measurements, biolayer interferometry and field-effect biosensing, and these confirmed each other and demonstrated a structure-activity relationship. As mTORC1 is altered in human GBMSC, and as mTORC1 inhibitors have been tested in previous GBM clinical trials, we tested the killing potency of the tightest-binding piperazines and observed that these were potent GBMSC killers. GBMSCs are resistant to the standard-of-care temozolomide therapy, but temozolomide supplemented with tight-binding piperazine meclizine and flunarizine greatly enhanced GBMSC death over temozolomide alone. Lastly, we investigated IDH1-mutated GBMSC mutations that are known to affect mitochondrial and mTORC1 metabolism, and the tight-binding meclizine provoked 'synthetic lethality' in IDH1-mutant GBMSCs. In other words, IDH1-mutated GBMSC showed greater sensitivity to the coadministration of temozolomide and meclizine. These data tend to support a novel clinical strategy for GBM, i.e., the co-administration of meclizine or flunarizine as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of GBM and IDH1-mutant GBM."
"MICHELMORE, Richard W",Upregulation of a KN1 homolog by transposon insertion promotes leafy head development in lettuce,"Leafy head is a unique type of plant architecture found in some vegetable crops, with leaves bending inward to form a compact head. The genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying leafy head in vegetables remain poorly understood. We genetically fine-mapped and cloned a major quantitative trait locus controlling heading in lettuce. The candidate gene (LsKN1) is a homolog of knotted 1 (KN1) from Zea mays Complementation and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments confirmed the role of LsKN1 in heading. In heading lettuce, there is a CACTA-like transposon inserted into the first exon of LsKN1 (LsKN1â–½). The transposon sequences act as a promoter rather than an enhancer and drive high expression of LsKN1â–½. The enhanced expression of LsKN1â–½ is necessary but not sufficient for heading in lettuce. Data from ChIP-sequencing, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and dual luciferase assays indicate that the LsKN1â–½ protein binds the promoter of LsAS1 and down-regulates its expression to alter leaf dorsoventrality. This study provides insight into plant leaf development and will be useful for studies on heading in other vegetable crops."

However, the prognosis and clinical features of this type of injury have not been described in equids.Hypotheses/objectivesTo describe survival rate, signalment, clinical features, and biochemical results in equids presented for emergency care after presumed dog attacks. We hypothesized there would be differences between survivors and nonsurvivors.AnimalsA total of 28 equids presented for presumed dog attacks from 3 referral centers.MethodsA retrospective study was performed using data from 3 hospitals between 2008 and 2016. Survival was defined as survival at 14â€‰days postdischarge. Variables were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors using a t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fisher's exact test as appropriate.ResultsOverall mortality rate was 21%. Ponies and miniature horses represented 16/28 (57%) of the animals in the study. Full-sized equids had a lower risk of nonsurvival as compared to smaller patients (odds ratio = 0.02; 95% confidence intervals = 0.00-0.27; Pâ€‰<â€‰.005). Animals with lower body temperatures had increased risk for nonsurvival (P = .0004). Increased admission blood lactate concentrations (P = .003) and decreased serum total protein concentrations (P = .006) were associated with nonsurvival.ConclusionsThe mortality rate in equids attacked by dogs was similar to what is reported for other veterinary species. Smaller equids and those with increased admission blood lactate concentration, lower body temperature, and lower total serum protein concentrations were less likely to survive."

To test the hypothesis that the inclusion of safe, live microbes in the diet supports and improves health, we propose assessment of the types and evidentiary quality of the data available on microbe intake, including the assembly and evaluation of evidence available from dietary databases. Such an analysis would help to identify gaps in the evidence needed to test this hypothesis, which can then be used to formulate and direct initiatives focused on prospective and randomized controlled trials on live microbe consumption. Outcomes will establish whether or not the evidence exists, or can be generated, to support the establishment of dietary recommendations for live microbes."

Here we used the socially monogamous prairie vole as a translational model of developmental SSRI exposure. Paired female prairie voles (n = 20) were treated with 5 mg/kg subcutaneous fluoxetine (FLX) or saline (SAL) daily from birth of the second litter until the day of birth of the 4th litter. This design created three cohorts of FLX exposure: postnatal exposure in litter 2, both prenatal and postnatal exposure in litter 3, and prenatal exposure in litter 4. Post-weaning, subjects underwent behavioral testing to detect changes in sociality, repetitive behavior, pair-bond formation, and anxiety-like behavior. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was performed for oxytocin, vasopressin 1a, and serotonin 1a receptor density in a subset of brains. We observed increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced sociality in developmentally FLX exposed adults. FLX exposure decreased oxytocin receptor binding in the nucleus accumbens core and central amygdala, and vasopressin 1a receptor binding in the medial amygdala. FLX exposure did not affect serotonin 1A receptor binding in any areas examined. Changes to oxytocin and vasopressin receptors may underlie the behavioral changes observed and have translational implications for the mechanism of the increased risk of ASD subsequent to prenatal SSRI exposure."

Given that zebrafish share >70% gene homologs with humans and their genomes can be readily edited using highly efficient CRISPR methods, we are now able to rapidly generate mutations impacting practically any gene of interest. Unfortunately, our ability to phenotype mutant larvae has not kept pace. To address this challenge, we have developed a protocol that obtains multiple phenotypic measurements from individual zebrafish larvae in an automated and parallel fashion, including morphological features (i.e., body length, eye area, and head size) and movement/behavior. By assaying wild-type zebrafish in a variety of conditions, we determined optimal parameters that avoid significant developmental defects or physical damage; these include morphological imaging of larvae at two time points [3 days post fertilization (dpf) and 5 dpf] coupled with motion tracking of behavior at 5 dpf. As a proof-of-principle, we tested our approach on two novel CRISPR-generated mutant zebrafish lines carrying predicted null-alleles of syngap1b and slc7a5, orthologs to two human genes implicated in autism-spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. Using our optimized high-throughput phenotyping protocol, we recapitulated previously published results from mouse and zebrafish models of these candidate genes.

Foundations of mechanistic understanding and well-established preclinical safety efficacy make it a viable candidate.MethodsA randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose trial was conducted. Intravenous allopregnanolone or placebo was administered once-per-week for 12&nbsp;weeks with a 1-month follow-up. Participants with early AD (mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD), a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 20-26 inclusive, and age â‰¥55 years were randomized (6:2 to three allopregnanolone dosing cohorts or one placebo cohort). Primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and maximally tolerated dose (MTD). Exploratory endpoints included cognitive and imaging biomarkers.ResultsA total of 24 participants completed the trial. Allopregnanolone was safe and well tolerated in all study participants. No differences were observed between treatment arms in the occurrence and severity of adverse events (AE). Most common AE were mild to moderate in severity and included rash (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 [22%]) and fatigue (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 [17%]). A single non-serious AE, dizziness, was attributable to treatment. There was one serious AE not related to treatment. Pharmacokinetics indicated a predictable linear dose-response in plasma concentration of allopregnanolone after intravenous administration over 30 minutes. The maximum plasma concentrations for the 2&nbsp;mg, 4&nbsp;mg, 6&nbsp;mg, and 10&nbsp;mg dosages were 14.53&nbsp;ng/mL (+/-7.31), 42.05&nbsp;ng/mL (+/-14.55), 60.07&nbsp;ng/mL (+/-12.8), and 137.48&nbsp;ng/mL (+/-38.69), respectively.

The diazotrophic microbiota associated with the plant's mucilaginous aerial root exudate composed of complex carbohydrates was previously identified and characterized by our group where we found 23 lactococci capable of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) without containing any of the proposed essential genes for this trait (nifHDKENB). To determine the genes in Lactococcus associated with this phenotype, we selected 70 lactococci from the dairy industry that are not known to be diazotrophic to conduct a comparative population genomic analysis. This showed that the diazotrophic lactococcal genomes were distinctly different from the dairy isolates. Examining the pangenome followed by genome-wide association study and machine learning identified genes with the functions needed for BNF in the maize isolates that were absent from the dairy isolates. Many of the putative genes received an 'unknown' annotation, which led to the domain analysis of the 135 homologs. This revealed genes with molecular functions needed for BNF, including mucilage carbohydrate catabolism, glycan-mediated host adhesion, iron/siderophore utilization, and oxidation/reduction control. This is the first report of this pathway in this organism to underpin BNF. Consequently, we proposed a model needed for BNF in lactococci that plausibly accounts for BNF in the absence of the nif operon in this organism."

There is a dearth of information on the genetic diversity of Ethiopian cocoyam. In order to evaluate and select cocoyam germplasm for breeding and conservation, genetic diversity of 100 Ethiopian cocoyam accessions (65 green- and 35 purple- cocoyam) were analyzed using 29 morphological traits (16 qualitative and 13 quantitative) and 12 SSR loci. Two classes of qualitative traits were observed. ANOVA revealed significant variation in 11 (84.6%) of the 13 studied quantitative traits. The SSR marker analysis showed high genetic diversity. A total of 36 alleles were detected with a range of 2 to 5 (average of 3.273) alleles per locus. The average observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) values across populations were 0.503 and 0.443, respectively. The analysis of molecular variance showed that the variation among populations, among individuals within populations, and within individuals explained 14%, 18%, and 68% of the total variation, respectively. Cluster analysis grouped the accessions irrespective of the collection sites. A dendrogram based on Nei's standard genetic distance grouped the green cocoyam accessions together while the purple cocoyam accessions occupied a separate position within the dendrogram. Significant variation in quantitative traits and the high level of genetic diversity revealed by the SSR markers suggest that diverse cocoyam accessions, probably with multiple lineage, were introduced multiple times, through multiple routes and probably by multiple agents, an hypothesis that needs futher testing and analyis. The crop, therefore, needs more research efforts commensurate with its economic and social values than it has been accorded thus far. Further study is recommended to clarify the taxonomic status of Ethiopian cocoyam accesions and to trace their evolutionary relationships with Xanthosoma species elsewhere."

The guides were used to create drill tracts in these vertebrae by both an experienced and a novice surgeon, and CT imaging was repeated. The entry point and angulation of actual and planned drill tracts were compared for both surgeons. Unintended cortical violations were also assessed by using a modified Zdichavsky classification.ResultsFifty-eight drill tracts were created in 30 vertebrae. Mean entry point deviation was 1.4â€‰mm (range, 0.4-3.4), and mean angular deviation was 5.1Â° (range, 1.5Â°-10.8Â°). There were no differences between surgeons in entry point deviation (P = .07) or angular deviation (P = .22). There were no unintended cortical bone violations, and all drill tracts were classified as modified Zdichavsky grade I.ConclusionThe 3-D printed guides used in the current study yielded drill tracts with small linear and angular errors from intended paths and 100% accuracy for placement within vertebral pedicles and bodies. This technique was conveniently used by both an experienced and a novice surgeon.Clinical significanceThis technique might be immediately applicable to clinical cases requiring thoracic vertebral stabilization and may allow safe and accurate implant placement for surgeons with varying experience levels."
"LANE, Nancy E",Characterization of individuals with osteoarthritis in the United States and their use of prescription and over-the-counter supplements,"PurposeOsteoarthritis (OA) is a frequently occurring, chronic condition; however, few studies describe the clinical characteristics of individuals with OA and the treatments they use to manage their symptoms. We conducted a study to characterize the OA population in the US and describe the nonsurgical management used by this population based on consumer research data collected through an online survey.MethodsData from the 2017 US National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) for adults aged â‰¥35 years were used to evaluate the relationship between OA and certain study participant characteristics and to identify the most commonly used treatment options. NHWS data were collected through a survey of individuals drawn from the internet panel maintained by Lightspeed Research (Bridgewater, New Jersey) and its panel partners. Weighted estimates were generated using data from the 2016 Current Population Survey (Annual Demographics File) of the US Census Bureau. Comparisons between the general and OA populations were made based on body mass index (BMI), exercise frequency, and comorbid diagnoses of hypertension or diabetes. Among the OA population, the use of dietary supplements, prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) treatments with chondroitin with or without glucosamine (Ch Â± Gl), prescription treatment by time since OA diagnosis, and utilization of a physical therapist were also recorded.ResultsThe prevalence of OA in the overall population was 17.6 % and was higher for individuals with a BMI â‰¥ 25 (21.9 %), patients diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes (36.2 %), and those who did not exercise regularly (19.0 %). Adults without OA were more likely to exercise regularly (12 days per month or more) than adults diagnosed with OA. Ch Â± Gl (6.0 %) was the most commonly used OTC dietary supplement in the OA population, followed by omega-3 fatty acids (2.8 %), vitamin D (1.9 %), calcium (1.1 %), and multivitamins (0.7 %). Individuals using Ch Â± Gl were more likely to use OTC only products (75.4 % vs 37.3 %) or prescription medications, namely non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or opioids, and OTC products (24.6 % vs 13.0 %) compared with individuals not using Ch Â± Gl, while individuals not using Ch Â± Gl were more likely to be untreated (30.3 % vs 0) or to use prescription medications only (19.4 % vs 0). Nearly 32 % of individuals with OA reported using prescription treatments, and the likelihood of using a prescription treatment increased with number of years since OA diagnosis (<3 years: 27.5 %; â‰¥21 years: 32.5 %). The pharmaceutical products used by this population primarily consisted of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and opioids. Approximately 13 % of patients with OA had visited a physical therapist in the past 6 months.ConclusionsThe prevalence of OA was higher in those with a high BMI, and comorbid diabetes or hypertension. Individuals with OA using Ch Â± Gl primarily reported use of OTC products only or used them in combination with prescription products. The likelihood of using prescription products increased with the length of OA history. These data provide valuable new information about demographics, clinical characteristics, and commonly used prescription and OTC treatments and dietary supplements in the OA population."
"TAI, Xiao Hui H",Public mobility data enables COVID-19 forecasting and management at local and global scales.,"Policymakers everywhere are working to determine the set of restrictions that will effectively contain the spread of COVID-19 without excessively stifling economic activity. We show that publicly available data on human mobility-collected by Google, Facebook, and other providers-can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and forecast the spread of COVID-19. This approach uses simple and transparent statistical models to estimate the effect of NPIs on mobility, and basic machine learning methods to generate 10-day forecasts of COVID-19 cases. An advantage of the approach is that it involves minimal assumptions about disease dynamics, and requires only publicly-available data. We evaluate this approach using local and regional data from China, France, Italy, South Korea, and the United States, as well as national data from 80 countries around the world. We find that NPIs are associated with significant reductions in human mobility, and that changes in mobility can be used to forecast COVID-19 infections."
"MATSUKUMA, Karen E",Diagnosing Hirschsprung disease by detecting intestinal ganglion cells using label-free hyperspectral microscopy,"Hirschsprung disease (HD) is a congenital disorder in the distal colon that is characterized by the absence of nerve ganglion cells in the diseased tissue. The primary treatment for HD is surgical intervention with resection of the aganglionic bowel. The accurate identification of the aganglionic segment depends on the histologic evaluation of multiple biopsies to determine the absence of ganglion cells in the tissue, which can be a time-consuming procedure. We investigate the feasibility of using a combination of label-free optical modalities, second harmonic generation (SHG); two-photon excitation autofluorescence (2PAF); and Raman spectroscopy (RS), to accurately locate and identify ganglion cells in murine intestinal tissue without the use of exogenous labels or dyes. We show that the image contrast provided by SHG and 2PAF signals allows for the visualization of the overall tissue morphology and localization of regions that may contain ganglion cells, while RS provides detailed multiplexed molecular information that can be used to accurately identify specific ganglion cells. Support vector machine, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis classification models were applied to the hyperspectral Raman data and showed that ganglion cells can be identified with a classification accuracy higher than 95%. Our findings suggest that a near real-time intraoperative histology method can be developed using these three optical modalities together that can aid pathologists and surgeons in rapid, accurate identification of ganglion cells to guide surgical decisions with minimal human intervention."
"BROWN, Nadean L",Multiple roles for Pax2 in the embryonic mouse eye,"The vertebrate eye anlage grows out of the brain and folds into bilayered optic cups. The eye is patterned along multiple axes, precisely controlled by genetic programs, to delineate neural retina, pigment epithelium, and optic stalk tissues. Pax genes encode developmental regulators of key morphogenetic events, with Pax2 being essential for interpreting inductive signals, including in the eye. PAX2 mutations cause ocular coloboma, when the ventral optic fissure fails to close. Previous studies established that Pax2 is necessary for fissure closure and to maintain the neural retina -- glial optic stalk boundary. Using a Pax2GFP/+ knock-in allele we discovered that the mutant optic nerve head (ONH) lacks molecular boundaries with the retina and RPE, rendering the ONH larger than normal. This was preceded by ventronasal cup mispatterning, a burst of overproliferation and followed by optic cup apoptosis. Our findings support the hypothesis that ONH cells are tripotential, requiring Pax2 to remain committed to glial fates. This work extends current models of ocular development, contributes to broader understanding of tissue boundary formation and informs the underlying mechanisms of human coloboma."

However, it is not known whether incidental curiosity-enhanced memory depends on when incidental information during curiosity states is encountered. Here, participants incidentally encoded unrelated face images at different time points while they anticipated answers to trivia questions. Across two experiments, we found memory enhancements for unrelated faces presented during high-curiosity compared with low-curiosity states, but only when presented shortly after a trivia question. This suggests processes associated with the elicitation of curiosity-but not sustained anticipation or the satisfaction of curiosity-enhance memory for incidental information."
"PARIKH, Atul N",Recurrent dynamics of rupture transitions of giant lipid vesicles at solid surfaces,"Single giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) rupture spontaneously from their salt-laden suspension onto solid surfaces. At hydrophobic surfaces, the GUVs rupture via a recurrent, bouncing ball rhythm. During each contact, the GUVs, rendered tense by the substrate interactions, porate, and spread a molecularly transformed motif of a monomolecular layer on the hydrophobic surface from the point of contact in a symmetric manner. The competition from pore closure, however, limits the spreading and produces a daughter vesicle, which re-engages with the substrate. At solid hydrophilic surfaces, by contrast, GUVs rupture via a distinctly different recurrent burst-heal dynamics; during burst, single pores nucleate at the contact boundary of the adhering vesicles, facilitating asymmetric spreading and producing a ""heart""-shaped membrane patch. During the healing phase, the competing pore closure produces a daughter vesicle. In both cases, the pattern of burst-reseal events repeats multiple times, splashing and spreading the vesicular fragments as bilayer patches at the solid surface in a pulsatory manner. These remarkable recurrent dynamics arise, not because of the elastic properties of the solid surface, but because the competition between membrane spreading and pore healing, prompted by the surface-energy-dependent adhesion, determine the course of the topological transition."

Ultrasound (US) patterns have demonstrated the utility in evaluating the risk of malignancy (ROM) of Bethesda category III nodules. This study aims to evaluate the value of 3 well-established US grading systems (American Thyroid Association &lsqb;ATA], Korean Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System &lsqb;Korean-TIRADS], and The American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System &lsqb;ACR-TIRADS]) in determining ROM in Bethesda category IV nodules.<h4>Methods</h4>Ninety-two patients with 92 surgically resected thyroid nodules who had Bethesda category IV cytology on FNA were identified. Nodule images were retrospectively graded using the 3 systems in a blinded manner. Associations between US risk category and malignant pathology for each system were analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 92 nodules, 56 (61%) were benign and 36 (39%) were malignant. Forty-seven per cent of ATA high risk nodules, 53% of K-TIRADS category 5 nodules, and 50% of ACR-TIRADS category 5 nodules were malignant. The ATA high-risk category had 25% sensitivity, 82% specificity, 47% positive predictive value (PPV) for malignancy. K-TIRADS category 5 had 25% sensitivity, 85% specificity, 53% PPV for malignancy. ACR-TIRADS category 5 had 25% sensitivity, 84% specificity, 50% PPV for malignancy. None of the 3 grading systems yielded a statistically significant correlation between US risk category and the ROM (P = .30, .72, .28).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The ATA, Korean-TIRADS, and ACR-TIRADS classification systems are not helpful in stratifying ROM in patients with Bethesda category IV nodules. Clinicians should be cautious of using ultra-sound alone when deciding between therapeutic options for patients with Bethesda category IV thyroid nodules."
"CRUTCHFIELD, James P",Towards Unsupervised Segmentation of Extreme Weather Events,"Extreme weather is one of the main mechanisms through which climate change
will directly impact human society. Coping with such change as a global
community requires markedly improved understanding of how global warming drives
extreme weather events. While alternative climate scenarios can be simulated
using sophisticated models, identifying extreme weather events in these
simulations requires automation due to the vast amounts of complex
high-dimensional data produced. Atmospheric dynamics, and hydrodynamic flows
more generally, are highly structured and largely organize around a lower
dimensional skeleton of coherent structures. Indeed, extreme weather events are
a special case of more general hydrodynamic coherent structures. We present a
scalable physics-based representation learning method that decomposes
spatiotemporal systems into their structurally relevant components, which are
captured by latent variables known as local causal states. For complex fluid
flows we show our method is capable of capturing known coherent structures, and
with promising segmentation results on CAM5.1 water vapor data we outline the
path to extreme weather identification from unlabeled climate model simulation
data."

The improvement of horticultural traits by 300â€‰years of breeding has enabled the global expansion of strawberry production. Here, we describe the genomic history of strawberry domestication from the earliest hybrids to modern cultivars. We observed a significant increase in heterozygosity among interspecific hybrids and a decrease in heterozygosity among domesticated descendants of those hybrids. Selective sweeps were found across the genome in early and modern phases of domestication-59-76% of the selectively swept genes originated in the three less dominant ancestral subgenomes. Contrary to the tenet that genetic diversity is limited in cultivated strawberry, we found that the octoploid species harbor massive allelic diversity and that F. Ã— ananassa harbors as much allelic diversity as either wild founder. We identified 41.8â€‰M subgenome-specific DNA variants among resequenced wild and domesticated individuals. Strikingly, 98% of common alleles and 73% of total alleles were shared between wild and domesticated populations. Moreover, genome-wide estimates of nucleotide diversity were virtually identical in F. chiloensis,F. virginiana, and F. Ã— ananassa (Ï€â€‰=â€‰0.0059-0.0060). We found, however, that nucleotide diversity and heterozygosity were significantly lower in modern F.

"RAST, Philippe","Bayesian Multivariate Mixed-Effects Location Scale Modeling of Longitudinal Relations Among Affective Traits, States, and Physical Activity","Intensive longitudinal studies and experience sampling methods are becoming more common in psychology. While they provide a unique opportunity to ask novel questions about within-person processes relating to personality, there is a lack of methods specifically built to characterize the interplay between traits and states. We thus introduce a Bayesian multivariate mixed-effects location scale model (M-MELSM). The formulation can simultaneously model both personality traits (the location) and states (the scale) for multivariate data common to personality research. Variables can be included to predict either (or both) the traits and states, in addition to estimating random effects therein. This provides correlations between location and scale random effects, both across and within each outcome, which allows for characterizing relations between any number of personality traits and the corresponding states. We take a fully Bayesian approach, not only to make estimation possible, but also because it provides the necessary information for use in psychological applications such as hypothesis testing. To illustrate the model we use data from 194 individuals that provided daily ratings of negative and positive affect, as well as their physical activity in the form of step counts over 100 consecutive days. We describe the fitted model, where we emphasize, with visualization, the richness of information provided by the M-MELSM. We demonstrate Bayesian hypothesis testing for the correlations between the random effects. We conclude by discussing limitations of the MELSM in general and extensions to the M-MELSM specifically for personality research."

However, the potential effect of chemicals may be greater among individuals at the 'tails' of outcome distributions. Here, we investigated distributional effects on the associations between gestational phthalate exposure and child Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)-related behaviors using quantile regression. We harmonized data from the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) (n = 140) Study, an enriched-risk cohort of mothers who had a child with ASD, and the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (n = 276), a general population cohort. We measured concentrations of 9 phthalate metabolites in urine samples collected twice during pregnancy. Caregivers reported children's ASD-related behaviors using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) at age 3-8 years; higher scores indicate more ASD-related behaviors. In EARLI, associations between phthalate concentrations and SRS scores were predominately inverse or null across SRS score quantiles. In HOME, positive associations of mono-n-butyl phthalate, monobenzyl phthalate, mono-isobutyl phthalate, and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate concentrations with SRS scores increased in strength from the median to 95th percentile of SRS scores. These results suggest associations between phthalate concentrations and SRS scores may be stronger in individuals with higher SRS scores."

We also investigated the effect of depth-of-interaction (DOI) resolution on the spatial resolution. All the scanners are built upon 128 DOI encoding dual-ended readout detectors with lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) arrays arranged in 8 detector rings. The solid angle coverages of the four scanners are all âˆ¼0.85 steradians. Each LYSO element has a cross-section of 0.44&nbsp;Ã—&nbsp;0.44 mm2 and the pitch size of the LYSO arrays are all 0.5 mm. The four scanners can be divided into two groups: (1) H2RS110-C10 and H2RS110-C20 with 40&nbsp;Ã—&nbsp;40 LYSO arrays, a ring diameter of 110 mm and axial length of 167 mm, and (2) H2RS160-C10 and H2RS160-C20 with 60&nbsp;Ã—&nbsp;60 LYSO arrays, a diameter of 160 mm and axial length of 254 mm. C10 and C20 denote the crystal thickness of 10 and 20 mm, respectively. The simulation results show that all scanners have a spatial resolution better than 0.5 mm at the center of the field-of-view (FOV). The radial resolution strongly depends on the DOI resolution and radial offset, but not the axial resolution and tangential resolution. Comparing the C10 and C20 designs, the former provides better resolution, especially at positions away from the center of the FOV, whereas the latter has 2Ã— higher sensitivity (âˆ¼10% versus âˆ¼20%). This simulation study provides evidence that the 110 mm systems are a good choice for total-body mouse studies at a lower cost, whereas the 160 mm systems are suited for both total-body mouse and rat studies."

"FINNO, Carrie J",Functional phenotyping of the CYP2D6 probe drug codeine in the horse.,"BackgroundIn humans, the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic resulting in substantial differences in the metabolism of drugs including anti-arrhythmics, neuroleptics, and opioids. The objective of this study was to phenotype a population of 100 horses from five different breeds and assess differences in the metabolic activity of the equine CYP2D6 homolog using codeine as a probe drug. Administration of a probe drug is a common method used for patient phenotyping in human medicine, whereby the ratio of parent drug to metabolite (metabolic ratio, MR) can be used to compare relative enzyme function between individuals. A single oral dose of codeine (0.6â€‰mg/kg) was administered and plasma concentrations of codeine and its metabolites were determined using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The MR of codeine O-demethylation [(codeine)/(morphine + morphine-3-glucuronide + morphine-6-glucuronide)] was determined using the area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated from time zero to infinity (AUC0-âˆž) for each analyte and used to group horses into predicted phenotypes (high-, moderate-, and low-MR).ResultsThe MR of codeine O-demethylation ranged from 0.002 to 0.147 (median 0.018) among all horses. No significant difference in MR was observed between breeds, age, or sex. Of the 100 horses, 11 were classified as high-MR, 72 moderate-MR, and 17 low-MR. Codeine AUC0-âˆž and O-demethylation MR were significantly different (p&nbsp;<â€‰0.05) between all three groups. The meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD MR was 0.089â€‰Â±â€‰0.027, 0.022â€‰Â±â€‰0.011, and 0.0095â€‰Â±â€‰0.001 for high-, moderate-, and low-MR groups, respectively. The AUC for the morphine metabolites morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide were significantly different between high-and low-MR groups (p&nbsp;<â€‰0.004 and p&nbsp;<â€‰0.006).ConclusionsThe MR calculated from plasma following codeine administration allowed for classification of horses into metabolic phenotypes within a large population. The range of codeine metabolism observed among horses suggests the presence of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D82 of which codeine is a known substrate. Additional studies including CYP2D82 genotyping of high- and low-MR individuals are necessary to determine the presence of CYP2D polymorphisms and their functional implications with respect to the metabolism of therapeutics."

Today, surveys of population genomic diversity are revealing extensive loss-of-function and gene content variation, yet the adaptive significance of much of this variation remains unknown. Here we examine the evolutionary dynamics of adaptive loss of function through the lens of population genomics and consider the challenges and opportunities of studying adaptive loss-of-function alleles using population genetics models. We discuss how the theoretically expected existence of allelic heterogeneity, defined as multiple functionally analogous mutations at the same locus, has proven consistent with empirical evidence and why this impedes both the detection of selection and causal relationships with phenotypes. We then review technical progress towards new functionally explicit population genomic tools and genotype-phenotype methods to overcome these limitations. More broadly, we discuss how the challenges of studying adaptive loss of function highlight the value of classifying genomic variation in a way consistent with the functional concept of an allele from classical population genetics."

"MONJAZEB, Arta M",Mouse Preclinical Cancer Immunotherapy Modeling Involving Anti-PD-1 Therapies Reveals the Need to Use Mouse Reagents to Mirror Clinical Paradigms,"Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has emerged as one of the most powerful tools to reverse cancer induced immune suppression. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligand 1(PD-1/PD-L1) are FDA-approved and their clinical use is rapidly expanding. As opposed to the clinical paradigm, which can result in significant responses and toxicities, it has been difficult to reproduce these effects preclinically using mouse models. In large part, this is due to models, which employ rapidly growing ex vivo cultured transplantable tumor cell lines engrafted into young naÃ¯ve inbred laboratory mice. However, another issue concerns the use and repeated application of xenogeneic reagents in mice (i.e., rat or hamster mAbs directed against mouse antigens at variance with clinical use of human or humanized mAbs). Building on our previous studies demonstrating that repeated administration of commonly used xenogeneic anti-PD-1 mAbs derived from both rat and hamster can induce fatal hypersensitivity in some tumor-bearing mice, we sought to compare these result with the effects of a mouse anti-mouse PD-1 mAb. Application of a murine anti-mouse PD-1 (clone: MuDX400) did not result in lethal anaphylaxis in the 4T1 tumor model. It also displayed superior antitumor effects in this and other tumor models, as it did not induce neutralizing antibody responses against the anti-PD-1 mAb, such as were observed when using xenogeneic anti-PD1 mAbs. These results demonstrate that more accurate preclinical modeling necessitates the use of mouse reagents mirroring the clinical scenario to ascertain long-term effects or toxicities, while avoiding xenogeneic responses, which do not occur clinically. Furthermore, these studies suggest a direct mechanism, whereby preclinical murine studies have often failed to recapitulate the clinical efficacy and toxicity of single agent checkpoint inhibition."
"SHAH, Priya S",Transient light-activated gene expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells,"BackgroundChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are widely used for industrial production of biopharmaceuticals. Many genetic, chemical, and environmental approaches have been developed to modulate cellular pathways to improve titers. However, these methods are often irreversible or have off-target effects. Development of techniques which are precise, tunable, and reversible will facilitate temporal regulation of target pathways to maximize titers. In this study, we investigate the use of optogenetics in CHO cells. The light-activated CRISPR-dCas9 effector (LACE) system was first transiently transfected to express eGFP in a light-inducible manner. Then, a stable system was tested using lentiviral transduction.ResultsTransient transfections resulted in increasing eGFP expression as a function of LED intensity, and activation for 48â€‰h yielded up to 4-fold increased eGFP expression compared to cells kept in the dark. Fluorescence decreased once the LACE system was deactivated, and a protein half-life of 14.9â€‰h was calculated, which is in agreement with values reported in the literature. In cells stably expressing the LACE system, eGFP expression was confirmed, but there was no significant increase in expression following light activation.ConclusionsTaken together, these results suggest that optogenetics can regulate CHO cell cultures, but development of stable cell lines requires optimized expression levels of the LACE components to maintain high dynamic range."

"VOGEL, Christoph F",Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling modifies Toll-like receptor-regulated responses in human dendritic cells,"Currently, it is not well understood how ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) modify inflammatory responses triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists in human dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we show that AhR ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the tryptophan derivatives 6-formylindolo[3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ), kynurenine (kyn), and the natural dietary compound indole-3-carbinol (I3C) differentially modify cytokine expression in human monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs). The results show that TLR-activated MoDCs express higher levels of AhR and are more sensitive toward the effects of AhR ligands. Depending on the cytokine, treatment with AhR ligands led to a synergistic or antagonistic effect of the TLR-triggered response in MoDCs. Thus, activation of AhR increased the expression of interleukin (IL)-1Î², but decreased the expression of IL-12A in TLR-activated MoDCs. Furthermore, TCDD and FICZ may have opposite effects on the expression of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) in TLR8-activated MoDCs indicating that the effect of the specific AhR ligand may depend on the presence of the specific TLR agonist. Gene silencing showed that synergistic effects of AhR ligands on TLR-induced expression of IL-1Î² require a functional AhR and the expression of NF-ÎºB RelB. On the other hand, repression of IL-12A by TCDD and FICZ involved the induction of the caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) transcription factor. Additionally, the levels of DC surface markers were decreased in MoDCs by TCDD, FICZ and I3C, but not by kyn. Overall, these data demonstrate that AhR modulates TLR-induced expression of cytokines and DC-specific surface markers in MoDCs involving NFÎºB RelB and the immune regulatory factor CDX2."

"WILLIAMS, Neal M",Larger workers outperform smaller workers across resource environments: An evaluation of demographic data using functional linear models,"Behavior and organization of social groups is thought to be vital to the functioning of societies, yet the contributions of various roles within social groups toward population growth and dynamics have been difficult to quantify. A common approach to quantifying these role-based contributions is evaluating the number of individuals conducting certain roles, which ignores how behavior might scale up to effects at the population-level. Manipulative experiments are another common approach to determine population-level effects, but they often ignore potential feedbacks associated with these various roles.Here, we evaluate the effects of worker size distribution in bumblebee colonies on worker production in 24 observational colonies across three environments, using functional linear models. Functional linear models are an underused correlative technique that has been used to assess lag effects of environmental drivers on plant performance. We demonstrate potential applications of this technique for exploring high-dimensional ecological systems, such as the contributions of individuals with different traits to colony dynamics.We found that more larger workers had mostly positive effects and more smaller workers had negative effects on worker production. Most of these effects were only detected under low or fluctuating resource environments suggesting that the advantage of colonies with larger-bodied workers becomes more apparent under stressful conditions.We also demonstrate the wider ecological application of functional linear models. We highlight the advantages and limitations when considering these models, and how they are a valuable complement to many of these performance-based and manipulative experiments."
"LANE, Nancy E",Secondary analysis of change in physical function after exercise intervention in older adults with hyperkyphosis and low physical function,"BackgroundHyperkyphosis is common in older adults and associated with low physical function and reduced health related quality of life (HrQol). Improved kyphosis has been previously established in kyphosis-targeted interventions in randomized controlled trials in older adults with hyperkyphosis; however, evidence for improved physical function is conflicting. Few studies have investigated change in physical function after a targeted kyphosis intervention in older adults with low physical function. The primary aim in this descriptive study was to explore change in physical function after a progressive high-intensity 3-month targeted kyphosis exercise and posture training intervention in older adults with low physical function and hyperkyphosis. Secondary aims were to explore change in HrQol, spinal strength and spinal curvature, and adherence and safety of the intervention.MethodsIn this secondary analysis of the Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) Kyphosis randomized trial, 101 community dwelling older men and women with hyperkyphosis who completed the intervention were divided into a low function group (LFG) and high function group (HFG). Baseline characteristics were compared between LFG and HFG. Physical function, HrQol, spinal strength and spinal curvature (kyphosis and lordosis) pre/post intervention change scores were explored within and between groups. Adherence and adverse events were examined in the LFG and HFG.ResultsTwenty-six (26%) older adults were LFG, mean Short Phyiscal Performance Battery (SPPB) 9.62 (SDâ€‰=â€‰1.17) points. At baseline, the LFG was older than HFG (p&nbsp;=â€‰0.005), experienced more pain, (p&nbsp;=â€‰0.060), had worse physical function and HrQol (p&nbsp;â‰¤â€‰0.001), and comparable kyphosis (p&nbsp;=â€‰0.640). SPPB changed 0.62 (95% CI: -â€‰0.20 to 1.44) points in the LFG and - 0.04 (95%CI: -â€‰0.28 to 0.19) points in the HFG, p&nbsp;=â€‰0.020. Gait speed changed 0.04 (95% CI: -â€‰0.02 to 0.10) m/s in the LFG. Kyphosis improved equally in both groups. Adherence to the intervention was 83% in the LFG and 79% in the HFG. There were no adverse events in either group.ConclusionsOlder adults with low physical function and hyperkyphosis may improve physical function after a kyphosis targeted intervention. Older adults with low physical function may safely participate in targeted high-intensity kyphosis exercise and posture training. This observation needs to be confirmed in larger adequately powered studies.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01766674 ."

Animal models provide an opportunity to identify mechanisms driving neuropathology associated with MIA. We performed time-course transcriptional profiling of mouse cortical development following induced MIA via poly(I:C) injection at E12.5. MIA-driven transcriptional changes were validated via protein analysis, and parallel perturbations to cortical neuroanatomy were identified via imaging. MIA-induced acute upregulation of genes associated with hypoxia, immune signaling, and angiogenesis, by 6 hr following exposure. This acute response was followed by changes in proliferation, neuronal and glial specification, and cortical lamination that emerged at E14.5 and peaked at E17.5. Decreased numbers of proliferative cells in germinal zones and alterations in neuronal and glial populations were identified in the MIA-exposed cortex. Overall, paired transcriptomic and neuroanatomical characterization revealed a sequence of perturbations to corticogenesis driven by mid-gestational MIA."
"YEH, Jay",Growth Failure Prevalence in Neonates with Gastroschisis : A Statewide Cohort Study.,"ObjectivesTo perform a multicenter study to assess growth failure in hospitalized infants with gastroschisis.Study designThis study included neonates with gastroschisis within sites in the University of California Fetal Consortium. The study's primary outcome was growth failure at hospital discharge, defined as a weight or length z score decrease >0.8 from birth. Regression analysis was performed to assess changes in z scores over time.ResultsAmong 125 infants with gastroschisis, the median gestational age was 37&nbsp;weeks (IQR 35-37). Length of stay was 32&nbsp;days (23-60); 55% developed weight or length growth failure at discharge (28% had weight growth failure, 42% had length growth failure, and 15% had both weight and length growth failure). Weight and length z scores at 14&nbsp;days, 30&nbsp;days, and discharge were less than birth (P&nbsp;<&nbsp;.01 for all). Weight and length z scores declined from birth to 30&nbsp;days (-0.10 and -0.11 z score units/week, respectively, P&nbsp;<&nbsp;.001). Length growth failure at discharge was associated with weight and length z score changes over time (P&nbsp;<&nbsp;.05 for both). Lower gestational age was associated with weight growth failure (OR 0.70 for each gestational age week, 95% CI 0.55-0.89, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;.004).ConclusionsGrowth failure, in particular linear growth failure, is common in infants with gastroschisis. These data suggest the need to improve nutritional management in these infants."

In this paper, we assess the potential of a stimulus-driven linear oscillator model (57) to predict dynamic attention to complex musical rhythms on an instant-by-instant basis. We use perceptual thresholds and pupillometry as attentional indices against which to test our model predictions. During a deviance detection task, participants listened to continuously looping, multiinstrument, rhythmic patterns, while being eye-tracked. Their task was to respond anytime they heard an increase in intensity (dB SPL). An adaptive thresholding algorithm adjusted deviant intensity at multiple probed temporal locations throughout each rhythmic stimulus. The oscillator model predicted participants' perceptual thresholds for detecting deviants at probed locations, with a low temporal salience prediction corresponding to a high perceptual threshold and vice versa. A pupil dilation response was observed for all deviants. Notably, the pupil dilated even when participants did not report hearing a deviant. Maximum pupil size and resonator model output were significant predictors of whether a deviant was detected or missed on any given trial. Besides the evoked pupillary response to deviants, we also assessed the continuous pupillary signal to the rhythmic patterns. The pupil exhibited entrainment at prominent periodicities present in the stimuli and followed each of the different rhythmic patterns in a unique way. Overall, these results replicate previous studies using the linear oscillator model to predict dynamic attention to complex auditory scenes and extend the utility of the model to the prediction of neurophysiological signals, in this case the pupillary time course; however, we note that the amplitude envelope of the acoustic patterns may serve as a similarly useful predictor. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to show entrainment of pupil dynamics by demonstrating a phase relationship between musical stimuli and the pupillary signal."

However, the lack of ideological diversity among cohousing adopters does not seem malleable. Cohousing adopters are predominately liberal and liberal ideology strongly predicts interest in cohousing. This research explored perceptions (including misperceptions) of cohousing and tested whether framing the concept differently could make it more appealing to Republicans and conservatives. Survey participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two versions of a survey, identical in all ways except in one version the term pocket neighborhoods was substituted for cohousing. Results revealed substantial misunderstanding of the concept of cohousing, particularly that it involves multiple unrelated households living under the same roof. There was no framing effect; those who identified as Republican or conservative did not find cohousing more appealing when it was called pocket neighborhoods. The most cited perceived benefits of cohousing were social interaction, relationships, and support, while lack of privacy and personal space topped the list of drawbacks. Understanding these common perceptions about cohousing can help stakeholders communicate more effectively about this model that promises many benefits to an apparently untapped prospective market."
"LASALLE, Janine M",Stable DNMT3L overexpression in SH-SY5Y neurons recreates a facet of the genome-wide Down syndrome DNA methylation signature,"BackgroundDown syndrome (DS) is characterized by a genome-wide profile of differential DNA methylation that is skewed towards hypermethylation in most tissues, including brain, and includes pan-tissue differential methylation. The molecular mechanisms involve the overexpression of genes related to DNA methylation on chromosome 21. Here, we stably overexpressed the chromosome 21 gene DNA methyltransferase 3L (DNMT3L) in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and assayed DNA methylation at over 26 million CpGs by whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) at three different developmental phases (undifferentiated, differentiating, and differentiated).ResultsDNMT3L overexpression resulted in global CpG and CpG island hypermethylation as well as thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The DNMT3L DMRs were skewed towards hypermethylation and mapped to genes involved in neurodevelopment, cellular signaling, and gene regulation. Consensus DNMT3L DMRs showed that cell lines clustered by genotype and then differentiation phase, demonstrating sets of common genes affected across neuronal differentiation. The hypermethylated DNMT3L DMRs from all pairwise comparisons were enriched for regions of bivalent chromatin marked by H3K4me3 as well as differentially methylated sites from previous DS studies of diverse tissues. In contrast, the hypomethylated DNMT3L DMRs from all pairwise comparisons displayed a tissue-specific profile enriched for regions of heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3 during embryonic development.ConclusionsTaken together, these results support a mechanism whereby regions of bivalent chromatin that lose H3K4me3 during neuronal differentiation are targeted by excess DNMT3L and become hypermethylated. Overall, these findings demonstrate that DNMT3L overexpression during neurodevelopment recreates a facet of the genome-wide DS DNA methylation signature by targeting known genes and gene clusters that display pan-tissue differential methylation in DS."
"CHOU, Po-Yen",Multidrug-Resistant Orthopaedic Surgical Site Infections Treated with Linezolid in Four Dogs,"Abstract
          Objectiveâ€ƒThis study aimed to report the adverse drug events and treatment outcome of systemic linezolid therapy to manage multi-drug resistant orthopaedic surgical site infection in dogs.
          Materials and Methodsâ€ƒRetrospective case review of four dogs that received linezolid to treat surgical site infections after orthopaedic surgery. Reevaluations consisted of a clinical examination or a telephone interview.
          Resultsâ€ƒSerum drug concentrations varied. All dogs showed a temporary resolution of clinical signs of surgical site infection. Two dogs that received linezolid at the previously reported dose developed drug-associated side effects. The side effects were anorexia, nausea, vomiting and regenerative anaemia. All side effects resolved after the discontinuation of linezolid. Surgical site infection recurred in two dogs 52 and 177 days after discontinuing linezolid respectively.
          Clinical significanceâ€ƒAdverse drug events occurred in dogs receiving oral linezolid at the dosage of 10 to 20â€‰mg/kg. Oral linezolid therapy failed to resolve deep orthopaedic surgical site infections in two out of four dogs. As a tertiary antimicrobial, linezolid should only be used in carefully selected cases while monitoring for drug-associated side effects."

"WHITMER, Rachel A",Temporal Trends in Stroke-Related Memory Change,"Background and purposeFindings from the Framingham Heart Study suggest that declines in dementia incidence rates over recent decades are partially due to decreases in stroke incidence and mortality; however, whether trends of declining dementia rates extend to survivors of incident stroke remains unclear. We investigated evidence for temporal trends in memory change related to incident stroke in a nationally representative cohort.MethodsAdults age 50+ in the HRS (Health and Retirement Study) were followed across three successive 6-year epochs (epoch 1: 1998-2004, n=16â€‰781; epoch 2: 2004-2010, n=15â€‰345; and epoch 3: 2010-2016; n=15â€‰949). Participants were included in an epoch if they were stroke-free at the start of that epoch. Annual rates of change in a composite z-standardized memory score were compared using demographic-adjusted linear regression models for stroke-free participants, those who survived after stroke, and those who died after stroke, considering memory change before stroke, at the time of stroke, and for years following stroke.ResultsCrude stroke incidence rates decreased from 8.5 per 1000 person-years in epoch 1 to 6.8 per 1000 person-years in epoch 3. Rates of memory change before and following stroke onset were similar across epochs. Memory decrement immediately after stroke onset attenuated from -0.37 points (95% CI, -0.44 to -0.29) in epoch 1 to -0.26 (95% CI, -0.33 to -0.18) points in epoch 2 and -0.25 (95% CI, -0.33 to -0.17) points in epoch 3 (P value for linear trend=0.02).ConclusionsDecreases in stroke-related dementia in recent years may be partially attributable to smaller memory decrements immediately after stroke onset. Findings suggest reductions in stroke incidence and improvements in stroke care may also reduce population burden of dementia. Further investigations into whether temporal trends are attributable to improvements in stroke care are needed."

"MASON, Jeremy K",Topological transitions during grain growth on a finite element mesh,"The topological transitions that occur to the grain boundary network during
grain growth in a material with uniform grain boundary energies are believed to
be known. The same is not true for more realistic materials, since more general
grain boundary energies in principle allow many more viable grain boundary
configurations. A simulation of grain growth in such a material therefore
requires a procedure to enumerate all possible topological transitions and
select the most energetically favorable one. Such a procedure is developed and
implemented here for a microstructure represented by a volumetric finite
element mesh. As a specific example, all possible transitions for a typical
configuration with five grains around a junction point are enumerated, and some
exceptional transitions are found to be energetically similar to the
conventional ones even for a uniform boundary energy. A general discrete
formulation to calculate grain boundary velocities is used to simulate grain
growth for an example microstructure. The method is implemented as a C++
library based on SCOREC, an open source massively parallelizable library for
finite element simulations with adaptive meshing."
"MASON, Jeremy K",Quotient Maps and Configuration Spaces of Hard Disks,"Hard disks systems are often considered as prototypes for simple fluids. In a
statistical mechanics context, the hard disk configuration space is generally
quotiented by the action of various symmetry groups. The changes in the
topological and geometric properties of the configuration spaces effected by
such quotient maps are studied for small numbers of disks on a square and
hexagonal torus. A metric is defined on the configuration space and the various
quotient spaces that respects the desired symmetries. This is used to construct
explicit triangulations of the configuration spaces as $\alpha$-complexes.
Critical points in a configuration space are associated with changes in the
topology as a function of disk radius, are conjectured to be related to the
configurational entropy of glassy systems, and could reveal the origins of
phase transitions in other systems. The number and topological and geometric
properties of the critical points are found to depend on the symmetries by
which the configuration space is quotiented."

Glycosylation of proteins influences function, but whether glycosylation is altered by diet is unknown.ObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of consuming a diet based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans on circulating glycoproteins that have previously been associated with cardiometabolic diseases.DesignForty-four women, with one or more metabolic syndrome characteristics, completed an 8-week randomized controlled feeding intervention (nâ€‰=â€‰22) consuming a diet based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA 2010); the remaining consumed a 'typical American diet' (TAD, nâ€‰=â€‰22). Fasting serum samples were obtained at week0 (baseline) and week8 (post-intervention); 17 serum proteins were chosen for targeted analyses. Protein standards and serum samples were analyzed in a UHPLC-MS protocol to determine peptide concentration and their glycan (fucosylation or sialylation) profiles. Data at baseline were used in correlational analyses; change in proteins and glycans following intervention were used in non-parametric analyses.ResultsAt baseline, women with more metabolic syndrome characteristics had more fucosylation (total di-fucosylated proteins: pâ€‰=â€‰0.045) compared to women with a lesser number of metabolic syndrome characteristics. Dietary refined grain intake was associated with increased total fucosylation (Ïâ€‰=â€‰-&nbsp;0.530, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and reduced total sialylation (Ïâ€‰=â€‰0.311, pâ€‰=â€‰0.042). After the 8-week intervention, there was higher sialylation following the DGA diet (Total di-sialylated protein pâ€‰=â€‰0.018, poly-sialylated orosomucoid pâ€‰=â€‰0.012) compared to the TAD diet.ConclusionsBased on this study, glycosylation of proteins is likely affected by dietary patterns; higher sialylation was associated with a healthier diet pattern. Altered glycosylation is associated with several diseases, particularly cancer and type 2 diabetes, and this study raises the possibility that diet may influence disease state by altering glycosylation.Clinical trial registrationNCT02298725 at clinicaltrials.gov; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02298725 ."
"RUNCIE, Daniel E",Social network analysis of the genealogy of strawberry: retracing the wild roots of heirloom and modern cultivars.,"The widely recounted story of the origin of cultivated strawberry (Fragaria Ã— ananassa) oversimplifies the complex interspecific hybrid ancestry of the highly admixed populations from which heirloom and modern cultivars have emerged. To develop deeper insights into the three-century-long domestication history of strawberry, we reconstructed the genealogy as deeply as possible-pedigree records were assembled for 8,851 individuals, including 2,656 cultivars developed since 1775. The parents of individuals with unverified or missing pedigree records were accurately identified by applying an exclusion analysis to array-genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We identified 187 wild octoploid and 1,171â€‰F. Ã— ananassa founders in the genealogy, from the earliest hybrids to modern cultivars. The pedigree networks for cultivated strawberry are exceedingly complex labyrinths of ancestral interconnections formed by diverse hybrid ancestry, directional selection, migration, admixture, bottlenecks, overlapping generations, and recurrent hybridization with common ancestors that have unequally contributed allelic diversity to heirloom and modern cultivars. Fifteen to 333 ancestors were predicted to have transmitted 90% of the alleles found in country-, region-, and continent-specific populations. Using parent-offspring edges in the global pedigree network, we found that selection cycle lengths over the past 200â€‰years of breeding have been extraordinarily long (16.0-16.9â€‰years/generation), but decreased to a present-day range of 6.0-10.0â€‰years/generation. Our analyses uncovered conspicuous differences in the ancestry and structure of North American and European populations, and shed light on forces that have shaped phenotypic diversity in F.

"GRANDI, Eleonora",Sexâ€Specific Classification of Drugâ€Induced Torsade de Pointes Susceptibility Using Cardiac Simulations and Machine Learning,"Torsade de Pointes (TdP), a rare but lethal ventricular arrhythmia, is a toxic side effect of many drugs. To assess TdP risk, safety regulatory guidelines require quantification of hERG channel block in vitro and QT interval prolongation in vivo for all new therapeutic compounds. Unfortunately, these have proven to be poor predictors of torsadogenic risk, and are likely to have prevented safe compounds from reaching clinical phases. Although this has stimulated numerous efforts to define new paradigms for cardiac safety, none of the recently developed strategies accounts for patient conditions. In particular, despite being a well-established independent risk factor for TdP, female sex is vastly under-represented in both basic research and clinical studies, and thus current TdP metrics are likely biased toward the male sex. Here, we apply statistical learning to synthetic data, generated by simulating drug effects on cardiac myocyte models capturing male and female electrophysiology, to develop new sex-specific classification frameworks for TdP risk. We show that (i) TdP classifiers require different features in females vs. males; (ii) male-based classifiers perform more poorly when applied to female data; and (iii) female-based classifier performance is largely unaffected by acute effects of hormones (i.e., during various phases of the menstrual cycle). Notably, when predicting TdP risk of intermediate drugs on female simulated data, male-biased predictive models consistently underestimate TdP risk in women. Therefore, we conclude that pipelines for preclinical cardiotoxicity risk assessment should consider sex as a key variable to avoid potentially life-threatening consequences for the female population."

"HOCH, Jeffrey S",Is Improved Survival in Early-Stage Pancreatic Cancer Worth the Extra Cost at High-Volume Centers?,"BackgroundVolume of operative cases may be an important factor associated with improved survival for early-stage pancreatic cancer. Most high-volume pancreatic centers are also academic institutions, which have been associated with additional healthcare costs. We hypothesized that at high-volume centers, the value of the extra survival outweighs the extra cost.Study designThis retrospective cohort study used data from the California Cancer Registry linked to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development database from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2012. Stage I-II pancreatic cancer patients who underwent resection were included. Multivariable analyses estimated overall survival and 30-day costs at low- vs high-volume pancreatic surgery centers. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and incremental net benefit (INB) were estimated, and statistical uncertainty was characterized using net benefit regression.ResultsOf 2,786 patients, 46.5% were treated at high-volume centers and 53.5% at low-volume centers. There was a 0.45-year (5.4 months) survival benefit (95% CI 0.21-0.69) and a $7,884 extra cost associated with receiving surgery at high-volume centers (95% CI $4,074-$11,694). The ICER was $17,529 for an additional year of survival (95% CI $7,997-$40,616). For decision-makers willing to pay more than $20,000 for an additional year of life, high-volume centers appear cost-effective.ConclusionsAlthough healthcare costs were greater at high-volume centers, patients undergoing pancreatic surgery at high-volume centers experienced a survival benefit (5.4 months). The extra cost of $17,529 per additional year is quite modest for improved survival and is economically attractive by many oncology standards."

"TUCKER, Cassandra B",Injury alters motivational trade-offs in calves during the healing period,"Injury can produce long-lasting motivational changes that may alter decisions made under risk. Our objective was to determine whether a routine painful husbandry procedure, hot-iron disbudding, affects how calves trade off risk avoidance against a competing motivation (i.e., feeding), and whether this response depends on time since injury. We used a startle test to evaluate this trade-off in calves disbudded 0 or 21&nbsp;days previously and non-injured control calves. For 3&nbsp;days, calves were individually habituated to the testing arena in which they received a 0.5 L milk meal via a rubber teat. On the 4th day, upon approaching the milk reward, the calf was startled by a sudden noise. We assessed the duration and magnitude of the calf's startle response, their latency to return to the milk bottle, and duration spent suckling after startling. No treatment differences were observed in the duration and magnitude of the startle response or in the probability of returning to the bottle after startling. However, among those who did return, disbudded calves spent longer suckling, indicating they accepted more risk in order to feed compared to controls. In addition, calves with 21-day-old injuries tended to return to the bottle faster compared to newly disbudded calves and controls. We suggest that hot-iron disbudding increases calves' motivation to suckle, as they were more likely to prioritize this behaviour over risk avoidance compared to control calves. This effect was most evident 21&nbsp;days after disbudding, indicating that injury can produce long-term changes in motivational state."

The downstream signaling system is wired with multiple feedback loops that amplify weak inputs and promote spatial separation of cell front and rear activities 1, 5â€“8 . Positive feedback could promote rapid signal spreading 9 , yet information from the receptors is transmitted with high spatial fidelity, enabling detection of small differences in chemoattractant concentration across the cell 1 . How the signal transduction network achieves signal amplification while preserving spatial information remains unclear. The GTPase Cdc42 is a cell-front polarity coordinator that is predictive of cell turning, suggesting an important role in spatial processing 10 . To directly measure information flow from receptors to Cdc42, we paired zebrafish parapinopsina, an optogenetic GPCR that allows reversible ON/OFF receptor control with a spectrally compatible red/far red Cdc42 FRET biosensor. Using this new toolkit, we show that positive and negative signals downstream of G-proteins shape a rapid, dose-dependent Cdc42 response. Furthermore, F-actin and Cdc42 itself provide two distinct negative signals that limit the duration and spatial spread of Cdc42 activation, maintaining output signals local to the originating receptors."

"SOEDERBERG MILLER, Lisa S",The Importance of Understanding COVID-19: The Role of Knowledge in Promoting Adherence to Protective Behaviors,"Background: Past research suggests that knowledge supports- but strong illness expectations thwart- adoption of protective behaviors (e.g., handwashing). Strong illness expectations may place COVID-19 essential workers at risk. It is unclear, however, whether knowledge can moderate the negative effects of pessimistic illness expectations on protective behaviors. We test COVID-19 knowledge as a moderator of the effects of (1) pessimistic illness expectations and (2) essential worker status on adherence to protective behaviors. Methods: Participants (n = 350) completed measures of knowledge, illness expectations, and protective behaviors. We used chi-square tests to examine associations between variables and logistic regressions to test the moderation models predicting adherence (low, high) while controlling for demographics. Results: Knowledge, illness expectations, and adherence were significantly associated with each other (p < 0.05). Essential workers had stronger illness expectations and lower knowledge than did non-essential workers (p < 0.001). Logistic regressions showed a non-significant Worker Status Ã— Knowledge interaction (p = 0.59) but a significant Knowledge Ã— Illness Expectations interaction (p < 0.05) indicating that those with strong illness expectations and low knowledge were disproportionately at risk of failing to adhere to recommended behaviors. Conclusions: Knowledge promotes protective behaviors by buffering the negative effects of pessimistic illness expectations. Essential workers are more likely to have low levels of knowledge with strong illness expectations, suggesting that educational policies may be warranted."
"FIEHN, Oliver","Exposure to DMSO during infancy alters neurochemistry, social interactions, and brain morphology in long-evans rats.","IntroductionDimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a widely used solvent to dissolve hydrophobic substances for clinical uses and experimental in vivo purposes. While usually regarded safe, our prior studies suggest changes to behavior following DMSO exposure. We therefore evaluated the effects of a five-day, short-term exposure to DMSO on postnatal infant rats (P6-10).MethodsDMSO was intraperitoneally injected for five days at 0.2, 2.0, and 4.0&nbsp;ml/kg body mass. One cohort of animals was sacrificed 24&nbsp;hr after DMSO exposure to analyze the neurometabolic changes in four brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum) by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. A second cohort of animals was used to analyze chronic alterations to behavior and pathological changes to glia and neuronal cells later in life (P21-P40).Results164 metabolites, including key regulatory molecules (retinoic acid, orotic acid, adrenic acid, and hypotaurine), were found significantly altered by DMSO exposure in at least one of the brain regions at P11 (p&nbsp;<&nbsp;.05). Behavioral tests showed significant hypoactive behavior and decreased social habits to the 2.0 and 4.0&nbsp;ml DMSO/kg groups (p&nbsp;<&nbsp;.01). Significant increases in number of microglia and astrocytes at P40 were observed in the 4.0&nbsp;ml DMSO/kg group (at p&nbsp;<&nbsp;.015.) CONCLUSIONS: Despite short-term exposure at low, putatively nontoxic concentrations, DMSO led to changes in behavior and social preferences, chronic alterations in glial cells, and changes in essential regulatory brain metabolites. The chronic neurological effects of DMSO exposure reported here raise concerns about its neurotoxicity and consequent safety in human medical applications and clinical trials."

"HENRY, Stephen G",The story vs the storyteller: Factors associated with the effectiveness of brief video-recorded patient stories for promoting opioid tapering.,"BackgroundNarrative communication is often more persuasive for promoting health behaviour change than communication using facts and figures; the extent to which narrative persuasiveness is due to patients' identification with the storyteller vs engagement with the story is unclear.ObjectiveTo examine the relative impacts of patient engagement, age concordance and gender concordance on perceived persuasiveness of video-recorded narrative clips about opioid tapering.MethodsPatient raters watched and rated 48 brief video-recorded clips featuring 1 of 7 different storytellers describing their experiences with opioid tapering. The dependent variable was clips' perceived persuasiveness for encouraging patients to consider opioid tapering. Independent variables were rater engagement with the clip, rater-storyteller gender concordance and rater-storyteller age concordance (<60 vs â‰¥60). Covariates were rater beliefs about opioids and opioid tapering, clip duration and clip theme. Mixed-effects models accounted for raters viewing multiple clips and clips nested within storytellers.ResultsIn multivariable models, higher rater engagement with the clip was associated with higher perceived persuasiveness (coefficient&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.46, 95% CI 0.39-0.53, P&nbsp;<&nbsp;.001). Neither age concordance nor gender concordance significantly predicted perceived persuasiveness. The theme Problems with opioids also predicted perceived persuasiveness.ConclusionHighly engaging, clinically relevant stories are likely persuasive to patients regardless of the match between patient and storyteller age and gender. When using patient stories in tools to promote health behaviour change, stories that are clinically relevant and engaging are likely to be persuasive regardless of storytellers' demographics.Patient or public contributionPatients were involved as storytellers (in each clip) and assessed the key study variables."

Repeated early-life exposures to diarrheal pathogens can result in comorbidities including stunted growth and cognitive deficits, suggesting an impairment in the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. Neonatal C57BL/6 mice were infected with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (strain e2348/69; Î”escV [type III secretion system {T3SS} mutant]) or the vehicle (Luria-Bertani [LB] broth) via orogastric gavage at postnatal day 7 (P7). Behavior (novel-object recognition [NOR] task, light/dark [L/D] box, and open-field test [OFT]), intestinal physiology (Ussing chambers), and the gut microbiota (16S Illumina sequencing) were assessed in adulthood (6 to 8â€‰weeks of age). Neonatal infection of mice with EPEC, but not the T3SS mutant, caused ileal inflammation in neonates and impaired recognition memory (NOR task) in adulthood. Cognitive impairments were coupled with increased neurogenesis (Ki67 and doublecortin immunostaining) and neuroinflammation (increased microglia activation [Iba1]) in adulthood. Intestinal pathophysiology in adult mice was characterized by increased secretory state (short-circuit current [Isc]) and permeability (conductance) (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-dextran flux) in the ileum and colon of neonatally EPEC-infected mice, along with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TnfÎ±, Il12, and Il6) and pattern recognition receptors (Nod1/2 and Tlr2/4). Finally, neonatal EPEC infection caused significant dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, including decreased Firmicutes, in adulthood. Together, these findings demonstrate that infection in early life can significantly impair the MGB axis in adulthood."

"ZHANG, Ruihong",Overview of biomass pretreatment for cellulosic ethanol production,"Bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol is significantly hindered by the structural and chemical complexity of biomass, which makes these materials a challenge to be used as feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol production. Cellulose and hemicellulose, when hydrolyzed into their component sugars, can be converted into ethanol through well established fermentation technologies. However, sugars necessary for fermentation are trapped inside the crosslinking structure of the lignocellulose. Hence, pretreatment of biomass is always necessary to remove and/or modify the surrounding matrix of lignin and hemicellulose prior to the enzymatic hydrolysis of the polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose) in the biomass. Pretreatment refers to a process that converts lignocellulosic biomass from its native form, in which it is recalcitrant to cellulase enzyme systems, into a form for which cellulose hydrolysis is much more effective. In general, pretreatment methods can be classified into three categories, including physical, chemical, and biological pretreatment. The subject of this paper emphasizes the biomass pretreatment in preparation for enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial fermentation for cellulosic ethanol production. It primarily covers the impact of biomass structural and compositional features on the pretreatment, the characteristics of different pretreatment methods, the pretreatment study status, challenges, and future research targets."

However, little is known about early development and symptom onset, information that is critical to guide earlier identification, more accurate prognoses, and improved treatment options. Data from 8 unique studies that used the Mullen Scales of Early Learning to assess children with an FMR1 gene expansion were combined to create a data set of 1178 observations of >500 young children. Linear mixed modeling was used to explore developmental trajectories, symptom onset, and unique developmental profiles of children <5 years of age. Boys with an FMR1 gene full mutation showed delays in early learning, motor skills, and language development as young as 6 months of age, and both sexes with a full mutation were delayed on all developmental domains by their second birthday. Boys with a full mutation continued to gain skills over early childhood at around half the rate of their typically developing peers; girls with a full mutation showed growth at around three-quarters of the rate of their typically developing peers. Although children with a premutation were mostly typical in their developmental profiles and trajectories, mild but significant delays in fine motor skills by 18 months were detected. Children with the FMR1 gene full mutation demonstrate significant developmental challenges within the first 2 years of life, suggesting that earlier identification is needed to facilitate earlier implementation of interventions and therapeutics to maximize effectiveness."
"ARZI, Boaz",Use of unbiased metagenomic and transcriptomic analyses to investigate the association between feline calicivirus and feline chronic gingivostomatitis in domestic cats.,"ObjectiveTo identify associations between microbes and host genes in cats with feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS), a debilitating inflammatory oral mucosal disease with no known cause, compared with healthy cats and cats with periodontitis (control cats).Animals19 control cats and 23 cats with FCGS.ProceduresAt least 1 caudal oral mucosal swab specimen was obtained from each cat. Each specimen underwent unbiased metatranscriptomic next-generation RNA sequencing (mNGS). Filtered mNGS reads were aligned to all known genetic sequences from all organisms and to the cat transcriptome. The relative abundances of microbial and host gene read alignments were compared between FCGS-affected cats and control cats and between FCGS-affected cats that did and did not clinically respond to primary treatment. Assembled feline calicivirus (FCV) genomes were compared with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) primers commonly used to identify FCV.ResultsThe only microbe strongly associated with FCGS was FCV, which was detected in 21 of 23 FCGS-affected cats but no control cats. Problematic base pair mismatches were identified between the assembled FCV genomes and RT-PCR primers. Puma feline foamy virus was detected in 9 of 13 FCGS-affected cats that were refractory to treatment and 5 healthy cats but was not detected in FCGS-affected cats that responded to tooth extractions. The most differentially expressed genes in FCGS-affected cats were those associated with antiviral activity.Conclusions and clinical relevanceResults suggested that FCGS pathogenesis has a viral component. Many FCV strains may yield false-negative results on RT-PCR-based assays. Coinfection of FCGS-affected cats with FCV and puma feline foamy virus may adversely affect response to treatment."

More recently, advances in human genetics, particularly in the field of ancient DNA, have shed new light on the question of whether or not Homo sapiens interbred with other hominin groups. By the late 1990s, published genetic work had largely concluded that archaic groups made no lasting genetic contribution to modern humans; less than a decade later, this conclusion was reversed following the successful DNA sequencing of an ancient Neanderthal. This reversal of consensus is noteworthy, but the reasoning behind it is not widely understood across all academic communities. There remains a communication gap between population geneticists and paleoanthropologists. In this review, we endeavor to bridge this gap by outlining how technological advancements, new statistical methods, and notable controversies ultimately led to the current consensus."

Crown gall, caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Phytophthora root and crown rots, caused by various Phytophthora spp., are among the most devastating walnut soil-borne diseases. A recognized strategy to combat soil-borne diseases is adoption of resistant rootstocks. Here, resistance to A. tumefaciens, P. cinnamomi, and P. pini is mapped in the genome of Juglans microcarpa, a North American wild relative of cultivated walnut. Half-sib J. microcarpa mother trees DJUG 31.01 and DJUG 31.09 were crossed with J. regia cv. Serr, producing 353 and 400 hybrids, respectively. Clonally propagated hybrids were genotyped by sequencing to construct genetic maps for the two populations and challenged with the three pathogens. Resistance to each of the three pathogens was mapped as a major QTL on the long arm of J. microcarpa chromosome 4D and was associated with the same haplotype, designated as haplotype b, raising the possibility that the two mother trees were heterozygous for a single Mendelian gene conferring resistance to all three pathogens. The deployment of this haplotype in rootstock breeding will facilitate breeding of a walnut rootstock resistant to both crown gall and Phytophthora root and crown rots."
"STEELE, Toby O",The Impact of Medical Comorbidities on Patient Satisfaction in Chronic Rhinosinusitis,"BackgroundPatient satisfaction has a significant bearing on medical therapy compliance and patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to (1) describe patient satisfaction, as characterized by the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-18 (PSQ-18), in the care of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and (2) analyze the impact of comorbidities on satisfaction using the functional comorbidity index (FCI).MethodsPatient demographics, disease severity measures, and PSQ-18 scores for patients with CRS presenting to a tertiary rhinology clinic between November 2019 and April 2020 were collected and analyzed. FCI was calculated retrospectively using the electronic medical record; individual comorbidities were tabulated. Spearman's correlations followed by multivariate regression was used to assess the relationship between medical comorbidities and PSQ-18.ResultsSixty-nine patients met criteria for analysis. There were no significant differences in age, gender, and Sinonasal Outcomes Test-22 scores between CRS patients with (CRSwNP) and without (CRSsNP) nasal polyps. There was no significant difference in the mean FCI for patients with CRSwNP versus CRSsNP (5.1 and 4.3, respectively) (Pâ€‰=â€‰.843). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the mean sum PSQ-18 score (78/100 in both) between these cohorts (Pâ€‰=â€‰.148). The mean sum PSQ-18 score was not significantly associated with anxiety (Pâ€‰=â€‰.728), depression (Pâ€‰=â€‰.624), or FCI (Pâ€‰=â€‰.282), but was significantly associated with hearing impairment (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001).ConclusionPatient satisfaction in the care of CRS is generally high with a diagnosis of comorbid hearing impairment demonstrating a negative association with satisfaction in this cohort."

"TANTILLO, Dean J",Quantum Chemistry Calculations for Metabolomics,"A primary goal of metabolomics studies is to fully characterize the small-molecule composition of complex biological and environmental samples. However, despite advances in analytical technologies over the past two decades, the majority of small molecules in complex samples are not readily identifiable due to the immense structural and chemical diversity present within the metabolome. Current gold-standard identification methods rely on reference libraries built using authentic chemical materials (""standards""), which are not available for most molecules. Computational quantum chemistry methods, which can be used to calculate chemical properties that are then measured by analytical platforms, offer an alternative route for building reference libraries, i.e., in silico libraries for ""standards-free"" identification. In this review, we cover the major roadblocks currently facing metabolomics and discuss applications where quantum chemistry calculations offer a solution. Several successful examples for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ion mobility spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry methods are reviewed. Finally, we consider current best practices, sources of error, and provide an outlook for quantum chemistry calculations in metabolomics studies. We expect this review will inspire researchers in the field of small-molecule identification to accelerate adoption of in silico methods for generation of reference libraries and to add quantum chemistry calculations as another tool at their disposal to characterize complex samples."

"YANG, Pei-Chi",Mechanisms of flecainide induced negative inotropy: An in silico study,"It is imperative to develop better approaches to predict how antiarrhythmic drugs with multiple interactions and targets may alter the overall electrical and/or mechanical function of the heart. Safety Pharmacology studies have provided new insights into the multi-target effects of many different classes of drugs and have been aided by the addition of robust new in vitro and in silico technology. The primary focus of Safety Pharmacology studies has been to determine the risk profile of drugs and drug candidates by assessing their effects on repolarization of the cardiac action potential. However, for decades experimental and clinical studies have described substantial and potentially detrimental effects of Na+ channel blockers in addition to their well-known conduction slowing effects. One such side effect, associated with administration of some Na+ channel blocking drugs is negative inotropy. This reduces the pumping function of the heart, thereby resulting in hypotension. Flecainide is a well-known example of a Na+ channel blocking drug, that exhibits strong rate-dependent block of INa and may cause negative cardiac inotropy. While the phenomenon of Na+ channel suppression and resulting negative inotropy is well described, the mechanism(s) underlying this effect are not. Here, we set out to use a modeling and simulation approach to reveal plausible mechanisms that could explain the negative inotropic effect of flecainide. We utilized the Grandi-Bers model [1] of the cardiac ventricular myocyte because of its robust descriptions of ion homeostasis in order to characterize and resolve the relative effects of QRS widening, flecainide off-target effects and changes in intracellular Ca2+ and Na+ homeostasis. The results of our investigations and predictions reconcile multiple data sets and illustrate how multiple mechanisms may play a contributing role in the flecainide induced negative cardiac inotropic effect."

"BERS, Donald M",Role of Reduced Sarco-Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+-ATPase Function on Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ Alternans in the Intact Rabbit Heart,"Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ cycling is tightly regulated by ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2+ release and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) Ca2+ uptake during each excitation-contraction coupling cycle. We previously showed that RyR refractoriness plays a key role in the onset of SR Ca2+ alternans in the intact rabbit heart, which contributes to arrhythmogenic action potential duration (APD) alternans. Recent studies have also implicated impaired SERCA function, a key feature of heart failure, in cardiac alternans and arrhythmias. However, the relationship between reduced SERCA function and SR Ca2+ alternans is not well understood. Simultaneous optical mapping of transmembrane potential (Vm) and SR Ca2+ was performed in isolated rabbit hearts (n = 10) using the voltage-sensitive dye RH237 and the low-affinity Ca2+ indicator Fluo-5N-AM. Alternans was induced by rapid ventricular pacing. SERCA was inhibited with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA; 1-10 Î¼M). SERCA inhibition (1, 5, and 10 Î¼M of CPA) resulted in dose-dependent slowing of SR Ca2+ reuptake, with the time constant (tau) increasing from 70.8 Â± 3.5 ms at baseline to 85.5 Â± 6.6, 129.9 Â± 20.7, and 271.3 Â± 37.6 ms, respectively (p < 0.05 vs. baseline for all doses). At fast pacing frequencies, CPA significantly increased the magnitude of SR Ca2+ and APD alternans, most strongly at 10 Î¼M (pacing cycle length = 220 ms: SR Ca2+ alternans magnitude: 57.1 Â± 4.7 vs. 13.4 Â± 8.9 AU; APD alternans magnitude 3.8 Â± 1.9 vs. 0.2 Â± 0.19 AU; p < 0.05 10 Î¼M of CPA vs. baseline for both). SERCA inhibition also promoted the emergence of spatially discordant alternans. Notably, at all CPA doses, alternation of SR Ca2+ release occurred prior to alternation of diastolic SR Ca2+ load as pacing frequency increased. Simultaneous optical mapping of SR Ca2+ and Vm in the intact rabbit heart revealed that SERCA inhibition exacerbates pacing-induced SR Ca2+ and APD alternans magnitude, particularly at fast pacing frequencies. Importantly, SR Ca2+ release alternans always occurred before the onset of SR Ca2+ load alternans. These findings suggest that even in settings of diminished SERCA function, relative refractoriness of RyR Ca2+ release governs the onset of intracellular Ca2+ alternans."
"UZAL, Francisco A",Sudden death caused by spinal cord injury associated with vertebral fractures and fetlock failure in a Thoroughbred racehorse.,"The most prevalent causes of death in racehorses are musculoskeletal injuries, causing ~83% of deaths within the racing industry in California and elsewhere. The vast majority of these injuries have preexisting lesions that predispose to fatal injury. A 4-y-old Thoroughbred colt suffered an acute suspensory apparatus failure, including biaxial proximal sesamoid bone fractures of the right front fetlock, causing loss of support of the fetlock joint and consequent fall with fractures of the cervical and sacral spine. Cervical fracture caused spinal cord damage that resulted in sudden death. A preexisting lesion in the medial proximal sesamoid bone likely predisposed to complete fracture of this bone and fetlock breakdown. Interestingly, a comparable osteopenic lesion was present in the intact medial proximal sesamoid bone of the left forelimb, which is consistent with bilateral repetitive overuse injury in racehorses. The morphologic features of the cervical and sacral spine fractures were compatible with acute injury; no evidence of preexisting lesions was seen. Most likely, these acute vertebral fractures occurred as a result of the horse falling. This case emphasizes the importance of performing a detailed autopsy in horses that suffer an appendicular musculoskeletal injury, particularly in fatal cases when the horse dies following a leg injury."
"HUISING, Mark O",Genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase ameliorates high fat diet-induced pancreatic Î²-cell dysfunction and loss,"Pancreatic Î²-cells are crucial regulators of systemic glucose homeostasis, and their dysfunction and loss are central features in type 2 diabetes. Interventions that rectify Î²-cell dysfunction and loss are essential to combat this deadly malady. In the current study, we sought to delineate the role of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in Î²-cells under diet-induced metabolic stress. The expression of sEH was upregulated in murine and macaque diabetes models and islets of diabetic human patients. We postulated that hyperglycemia-induced elevation in sEH leads to a reduction in its substrates, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), and attenuates the function of Î²-cells. Genetic deficiency of sEH potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in mice, likely in a cell-autonomous manner, contributing to better systemic glucose control. Consistent with this observation, genetic and pharmacological inactivation of sEH and the treatment with EETs exhibited insulinotropic effects in isolated murine islets ex vivo. Additionally, sEH deficiency enhanced glucose sensing and metabolism with elevated ATP and cAMP concentrations. This phenotype was associated with attenuated oxidative stress and diminished Î²-cell death in sEH deficient islets. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of sEH in vivo mitigated, albeit partly, high fat diet-induced Î²-cell loss and dedifferentiation. The current observations provide new insights into the role of sEH in Î²-cells and information that may be leveraged for the development of a mechanism-based intervention to rectify Î²-cell dysfunction and loss."
"SATO, Daisuke",Intracellular Na+ Modulates Pacemaking Activity in Murine Sinoatrial Node Myocytes: An In Silico Analysis,"Background: The mechanisms underlying dysfunction in the sinoatrial node (SAN), the heart's primary pacemaker, are incompletely understood. Electrical and Ca2+-handling remodeling have been implicated in SAN dysfunction associated with heart failure, aging, and diabetes. Cardiomyocyte [Na+]i is also elevated in these diseases, where it contributes to arrhythmogenesis. Here, we sought to investigate the largely unexplored role of Na+ homeostasis in SAN pacemaking and test whether [Na+]i dysregulation may contribute to SAN dysfunction. Methods: We developed a dataset-specific computational model of the murine SAN myocyte and simulated alterations in the major processes of Na+ entry (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCX) and removal (Na+/K+ ATPase, NKA). Results: We found that changes in intracellular Na+ homeostatic processes dynamically regulate SAN electrophysiology. Mild reductions in NKA and NCX function increase myocyte firing rate, whereas a stronger reduction causes bursting activity and loss of automaticity. These pathologic phenotypes mimic those observed experimentally in NCX- and ankyrin-B-deficient mice due to altered feedback between the Ca2+ and membrane potential clocks underlying SAN firing. Conclusions: Our study generates new testable predictions and insight linking Na+ homeostasis to Ca2+ handling and membrane potential dynamics in SAN myocytes that may advance our understanding of SAN (dys)function."

Rapid whole-genome sequencing (rWGS)-based rapid precision medicine (RPM) is an intervention that has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes and reduced costs of care. However, the feasibility of broad clinical deployment has not been established. The objective of this study was to implement RPM based on rWGS and evaluate the clinical and economic impact of this implementation as a first line diagnostic test in the California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) program. Project Baby Bear was a payor funded, prospective, real-world quality improvement project in the regional ICUs of five tertiary care children's hospitals. Participation was limited to acutely ill Medi-Cal beneficiaries who were admitted November 2018 to May 2020, were <1 year old and within one week of hospitalization, or had just developed an abnormal response to therapy. The whole cohort received RPM. There were two prespecified primary outcomes-changes in medical care reported by physicians and changes in the cost of care. The majority of infants were from underserved populations. Of 184 infants enrolled, 74 (40%) received a diagnosis by rWGS that explained their admission in a median time of 3&nbsp;days. In 58 (32%) affected individuals, rWGS led to changes in medical care. Testing and precision medicine cost $1.7 million and led to $2.2-2.9 million cost savings. rWGS-based RPM had clinical utility and reduced net health care expenditures for infants in regional ICUs. rWGS should be considered early in ICU admission when the underlying etiology is unclear."
"LUOMA, Samuel N","Preparing Scientists, Policy-Makers, and Managers for a Fast-Forward Future","Ecosystems in the Sacramentoâ€“San Joaquin Delta are changing rapidly, as are ecosystems around the world. Extreme events are becoming more frequent and thresholds are likely to be crossed more often, creating greater uncertainty about future conditions. The accelerating speed of change means that ecological systems may not remain stable long enough for scientists to understand them, much less use their research findings to inform policy and management. Faced with these challenges, those involved in science, policy, and management must adapt and change and anticipate what the ecosystems may be like in the future. We highlight several ways of looking aheadâ€”scenario analyses, horizon scanning, expert elicitation, and dynamic planningâ€”and suggest that recent advances in distributional ecology, disturbance ecology, resilience thinking, and our increased understanding of coupled humanâ€“natural systems may provide fresh ways of thinking about more rapid change in the future. To accelerate forward-looking science, policy, and management in the Delta, we propose that the State of California create a Delta Science Visioning Process to fully and openly assess the challenges of more rapid change to science, policy, and management and propose appropriate solutions, through legislation, if needed.

"LEIN, Pamela J",Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Profiles of Neurodevelopmental Disorder Genes in Mouse Placenta and Fetal Brain Following Prenatal Exposure to Polychlorinated Biphenyls,"Background Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are developmental neurotoxicants implicated as environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Objective We examined the effects of prenatal exposure to a human-relevant mixture of PCBs on the DNA methylome of fetal mouse brain and placenta to determine if there was a shared subset of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Methods A PCB mixture formulated to model the 12 most abundant congeners detected in the serum of pregnant women from a prospective high-risk ASD cohort was administered to female mice prior to and during pregnancy. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed to assess genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of placenta and brain on gestational day 18. Results We found thousands of significant (empirical p < 0.05) DMRs distinguishing placentas and brains from PCB-exposed embryos from sex-matched vehicle controls. In both placenta and brain, PCB-associated DMRs were significantly ( p < 0.005) enriched for functions related to neurodevelopment, cellular adhesion, and cellular signaling, and significantly (Odds Ratio > 2.4, q < 0.003) enriched for bivalent chromatin marks. The placenta and brain PCB DMRs overlapped significantly (Z-score = 4.5, p = 0.0001) by genomic coordinate and mapped to a shared subset of genes significantly ( q < 0.05) enriched for Wnt signaling, Slit/Robo signaling, and genes differentially expressed in multiple NDD/ASD models.

"GONCHAROVA, Elena A",Wilson Disease: Intersecting DNA Methylation and Histone Acetylation Regulation of Gene Expression in a Mouse Model of Hepatic Copper Accumulation,"Background &amp; aimsThe pathogenesis of Wilson disease (WD) involves hepatic and brain copper accumulation resulting from pathogenic variants affecting the ATP7B gene and downstream epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms. Prior methylome investigations in human WD liver and blood and in the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) C3He-Atp7btx-j/J (tx-j) WD mouse model revealed an epigenetic signature of WD, including changes in histone deacetylase (HDAC) 5. We tested the hypothesis that histone acetylation is altered with respect to copper overload and aberrant DNA methylation in WD.MethodsWe investigated class IIa HDAC4 and HDAC5 and&nbsp;H3K9/H3K27 histone acetylation in tx-j mouse livers compared with C3HeB/FeJ (C3H) control in response to 3 treatments: 60% kcal fat diet, D-penicillamine (copper chelator), and choline (methyl group donor). Experiments with copper-loaded hepatoma G2 cells were conducted to validate in&nbsp;vivo studies.ResultsIn 9-week tx-j mice, HDAC5 levels increased significantly after 8 days of a 60% kcal fat diet compared with chow. In 24-week tx-j mice, HDAC4/5 levels were reduced 5- to 10-fold compared with C3H, likely through mechanisms involving HDAC phosphorylation. HDAC4/5 levels were affected by disease progression and accompanied by increased acetylation. D-penicillamine and choline partially restored HDAC4/5 and H3K9ac/H3K27ac to C3H levels. Integrated RNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses revealed genes regulating energy metabolism and cellular stress/development, which, in turn, were regulated by histone acetylation in tx-j mice compared with C3H mice, with PparÎ± and PparÎ³ among the most relevant targets.ConclusionsThese results suggest dietary modulation of class IIa HDAC4/5, and subsequent H3K9/H3K27 acetylation/deacetylation can regulate gene expression in key metabolic pathways in the pathogenesis of WD."
"SIMMONS, Christopher W",Soil Application of Almond Residue Biomass Following Black Soldier Fly Larvae Cultivation,"Insect farming has the potential to transform abundant residual biomass into feed that is compatible with non-ruminant animal production systems. However, insect cultivation generates its own by-products. There is a need to find valuable and sustainable applications for this material to enable commercial-scale insect farming. Soil application of by-products, which may be either basic broadcasting incorporation or part of a sustainable soil borne pest management practice, such as biosolarization, could offer an agricultural outlet. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of applying black soldier fly larvae (BSFL)-digested substrate as soil amendment for soil biosolarization and evaluate its impact on soil health. Sandy loam (SL) and sandy clay loam (CL) soils amended with BSFL-digested almond processing residues, i.e., spent pollinator hulls (SPH), at 2% dry weight (dw) were incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 15 days under a daily fluctuating temperature-interval (30â€“50Â°C). The microbial respiration, pH, electrical conductivity, volatile fatty acids, macronutrients, and germination index using radish seeds (Raphanus sativus L.) were quantified to assess the soil health after amendment application. Incubation showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in electrical conductivity related to amendment addition and a decrease potentially linked to microbiological activity, i.e., sequestering of ions. Under aerobic conditions, SPH addition increased the CO2-accumulation by a factor of 5â€“6 compared to the non-amended soils in SL and CL, respectively. This increase further suggests a higher microbiological activity and that SPH behaves like a partially stabilized organic material. Under anaerobic conditions, CO2-development remained unchanged. BSFL-digested residues significantly increased the carbon, nitrogen, C/N, phosphate, ammonium, and potassium in the two soil types, replenishing soils with essential macronutrients. However, greenhouse trials with lettuce seeds (Lactuca sativa) lasting 14 days resulted in a decrease of the biomass by 44.6 Â± 35.4 and 35.2 Â± 25.3% for SL and CL, respectively, compared to their respective non-amended soil samples. This reduction of the biomass resulted from residual phytotoxic compounds, indicating that BSFL-digested SPH have the potential to be used for biosolarization and as soil amendments, depending on the concentration and mitigation strategies. Application and environmental conditions must be carefully selected to minimize the persistence of soil phytotoxicity."
"LUBARSKY, David A",Perioperative dexmedetomidine and 5-year survival in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.,"BackgroundDexmedetomidine sedation has been associated with favourable outcomes after surgery. We aimed to assess whether perioperative dexmedetomidine use is associated with improved survival after cardiac surgery.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included 2068 patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve surgery. Among them, 1029 patients received dexmedetomidine, and 1039 patients did not. Intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion of 0.007 Î¼g kg-1 min-1 was initiated before or immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass and lasted for < 24 h. The primary outcome was 5-year survival after cardiac surgery. The propensity scores matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and overlap weighting approaches were used to minimise bias. Survival analyses were performed with Cox proportional-hazard models.ResultsThe median age was 63 yr old and the male to female ratio was 71:29 in both groups. Baseline covariates were balanced between groups after adjustment using PSM, IPTW, or overlap weighting. Patients receiving dexmedetomidine in cardiac surgical procedures had higher survival during postoperative 5 yr in unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio [HR]=0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.78; P<0.001), and after adjustment with PSM (HR=0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.89; P=0.009), IPTW (HR=0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.95; P=0.023), or overlap weighting (HR=0.67; 95% CI, 0.51-0.89; P=0.006). The 5-yr mortality rate after cardiac surgery was 13% and 20% in the dexmedetomidine and non-dexmedetomidine groups, respectively (PSM adjusted odds ratio=0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.89; P=0.010).ConclusionPerioperative dexmedetomidine infusion was associated with improved 5-yr survival in patients undergoing cardiac surgery."
"FOLEY, Janet E",Detection of Babesia odocoilei in Humans with Babesiosis Symptoms,"Human babesiosis is a life-threatening infectious disease that causes societal and economic impact worldwide. Several species of Babesia cause babesiosis in terrestrial vertebrates, including humans. A one-day clinic was held in Ontario, Canada, to see if a red blood cell parasite, which is present in blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, is present in humans. Based on PCR testing and DNA sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene, we unveiled B. odocoilei in two of 19 participants. DNA amplicons from these two patients are almost identical matches with the type strains of B. odocoilei in GenBank. In addition, the same two human subjects had the hallmark symptoms of human babesiosis, including night sweats, chills, fevers, and profound fatigue. Based on symptoms and molecular identification, we provide substantive evidence that B. odocoilei is pathogenic to humans. Dataset reveals that B. odocoilei serologically cross-reacts with Babesia duncani. Clinicians must realize that there are more than two Babesia spp. in North America that cause human babesiosis. This discovery signifies the first report of B. odocoilei causing human babesiosis."

The role of innervation and neuromediators has been previously reviewed so here we focus on the role of the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) in wound healing, with the intent of targeting it in treatment of non-healing wounds. TRPV1 structure and function as well as the outcomes of TRPV1-targeted therapies utilized in several diseases and tissues are summarized. In skin, keratinocytes, sebocytes, nociceptors, and several immune cells express TRPV1, making it an attractive focus area for treating wounds. Many intrinsic and extrinsic factors confound the function and targeting of TRPV1 and may lead to adverse or off-target effects. Therefore, a better understanding of what is known about the role of TRPV1 in skin and wound healing will inform future therapies to treat impaired and chronic wounds to improve healing."
"POST, Eric",Experimental warming differentially affects vegetative and reproductive phenology of tundra plants,"Rapid climate warming is altering Arctic and alpine tundra ecosystem structure and function, including shifts in plant phenology. While the advancement of green up and flowering are well-documented, it remains unclear whether all phenophases, particularly those later in the season, will shift in unison or respond divergently to warming. Here, we present the largest synthesis to our knowledge of experimental warming effects on tundra plant phenology from the International Tundra Experiment. We examine the effect of warming on a suite of season-wide plant phenophases. Results challenge the expectation that all phenophases will advance in unison to warming. Instead, we find that experimental warming caused: (1) larger phenological shifts in reproductive versus vegetative phenophases and (2) advanced reproductive phenophases and green up but delayed leaf senescence which translated to a lengthening of the growing season by approximately 3%. Patterns were consistent across sites, plant species and over time. The advancement of reproductive seasons and lengthening of growing seasons may have significant consequences for trophic interactions and ecosystem function across the tundra."

This study evaluates the associations of experiences of discrimination with cognitive function and whether these associations varied by race/ethnicity and nativity.MethodUsing the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences (KHANDLE) cohort (N = 1 712) with approximately equal groups of Black, White, Latino, and Asian community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and older, we evaluated the associations between self-reported experiences of everyday and major lifetime discrimination with overall cognitive performance and domain-specific cognition (verbal episodic memory, semantic memory, and executive functioning) across race/ethnicity and nativity. Linear regression models examined the cross-sectional association between self-reported experiences of everyday and major lifetime discrimination with z-standardized coefficients for cognition. We tested for effect modification by race and nativity. All models controlled for age, sex, and education.ResultsAmong KHANDLE participants (mean age: 76 years; SD: 6.8), everyday discrimination was not associated with cognitive scores. Major lifetime discrimination was associated with better average cognitive scores among Black participants but not among other racial/ethnic groups. Major lifetime discrimination was associated with better average cognitive scores among U.S.-born but not among non-U.S.-born individuals.ConclusionOur findings do not imply that discrimination improves cognition, but rather suggest that future research should include more detailed measures on discrimination and unfair treatment that could help disentangle the extent to which relationships are causal or reflect some other underlying factor."
"CALLCUT, Rachael A",Outcomes after ultramassive transfusion in the modern era: An Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma multicenter study.,"BackgroundDespite the widespread institution of modern massive transfusion protocols with balanced blood product ratios, survival for patients with traumatic hemorrhage receiving ultramassive transfusion (UMT) (defined as â‰¥20 U of packed red blood cells [RBCs]) in 24 hours) remains low and resource consumption remains high. Therefore, we aimed to identify factors associated with mortality in trauma patients receiving UMT in the modern resuscitation era.MethodsAn Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma multicenter retrospective study of 461 trauma patients from 17 trauma centers who received â‰¥20 U of RBCs in 24 hours was performed (2014-2019). Multivariable logistic regression and Classification and Regression Tree analysis were used to identify clinical characteristics associated with mortality.ResultsThe 461 patients were young (median age, 35 years), male (82%), severely injured (median Injury Severity Score, 33), in shock (median shock index, 1.2; base excess, -9), and transfused a median of 29 U of RBCs, 22 U of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 24 U of platelets (PLT). Mortality was 46% at 24 hours and 65% at discharge. Transfusion of RBC/FFP â‰¥1.5:1 or RBC/PLT â‰¥1.5:1 was significantly associated with mortality, most pronounced for the 18% of patients who received both RBC/PLT and RBC/FFP â‰¥1.5:1 (odds ratios, 3.11 and 2.81 for mortality at 24 hours and discharge; both p < 0.01). Classification and Regression Tree identified that age older than 50 years, low initial Glasgow Coma Scale, thrombocytopenia, and resuscitative thoracotomy were associated with low likelihood of survival (14-26%), while absence of these factors was associated with the highest survival (71%).ConclusionDespite modern massive transfusion protocols, one half of trauma patients receiving UMT are transfused with either RBC/FFP or RBC/PLT in unbalanced ratios â‰¥1.5:1, with increased associated mortality. Maintaining focus on balanced ratios during UMT is critical, and consideration of advanced age, poor initial mental status, thrombocytopenia, and resuscitative thoracotomy can aid in prognostication.Level of evidencePrognostic, level III."
"BOBINSKI, Matthew",Relationship Between Cerebrovascular Reactivity and Cognition Among People With Risk of Cognitive Decline.,"Vascular risk factors (e.g., obesity and hypertension) are associated with cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology, and dementia. Reduced perfusion may reflect the impaired ability of blood vessels to regulate blood flow in reaction to varying circumstances such as hypercapnia (increased end-tidal partial pressures of CO2). It has been shown that cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) measured with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI is correlated with cognitive performance and alterations of CVR may be an indicator of vascular disfunction leading to cognitive decline. However, the underlying mechanism of CVR alterations in BOLD signal may not be straight-forward because BOLD signal is affected by multiple physiological parameters, such as cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume, and oxygen metabolism. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI quantitatively measures blood flow in the brain providing images of local CBF. Therefore, in this study, we measured CBF and its changes using a dynamic ASL technique during a hypercapnia challenge and tested if CBF or CVR was related to cognitive performance using the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score. Seventy-eight participants underwent cognitive testing and MRI including ASL during a hypercapnia challenge with a RespirAct computer-controlled gas blender, targeting 10 mmHg higher end-tidal CO2 level than the baseline while end-tidal O2 level was maintained. Pseudo-continuous ASL (PCASL) was collected during a 2-min baseline and a 2-min hypercapnic period. CVR was obtained by calculating a percent change of CBF per the end-tidal CO2 elevation in mmHg between the baseline and the hypercapnic challenge. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that baseline resting CBF has no significant relationship with MMSE, while lower CVR in the whole brain gray matter (Î² = 0.689, p = 0.005) and white matter (Î² = 0.578, p = 0.016) are related to lower MMSE score. In addition, region of interest (ROI) based analysis showed positive relationships between MMSE score and CVR in 26 out of 122 gray matter ROIs."
"STEELE, Toby O",The Impact of Surgical Posterior Nasal Nerve Cryoablation on Symptoms and Disease-Specific Quality of Life in Patients With Chronic Rhinitis,"ObjectivePreliminary data have demonstrated long-term efficacy of posterior nasal nerve (PNN) cryoablation in reducing rhinitis symptoms for patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and nonallergic rhinitis (NAR). We sought to evaluate the impact of procedural cryoablation of the PNN on quality of life (QOL) in patients with AR and NAR.MethodsAdult patients undergoing PNN cryoablation for AR or NAR after appropriate medical therapy were included for analysis. Demographics, medical therapies, baseline rhinitis symptom (total nasal symptom score [TNSS]), and disease-specific QOL (mini-rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire [mini-RQLQ]) were recorded. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test for significant changes in baseline test scores posttreatment. Absolute and relative improvement in outcomes was determined for each participant. Secondary outcomes were assessed with univariate and multivariate analyses.ResultsFourteen patients were enrolled with a mean follow-up of 16.5 weeks. The TNSS and mini-RQLQ scores significantly improved after PNN cryoablation (median Î´s [interquartile range]: -4 [3] and -1.61 [1.08], respectively; both P = .0002). The minimal clinically important difference for the TNSS and mini-RQLQ was obtained in 92.9% of patients in each category. Relative mean percentage (%) improvement after PNN cryoablation in the TNSS and mini-RQLQ was 40.7% and 40.5% (standard deviation = 24.9 and 29.5, respectively), respectively, for all patients. Patients with NAR (n = 10) reported mean improvement of 41.3% (29.1) as measured by the TNSS and 49.6% (25.9) by mini-RQLQ. Patients with AR reported mean percentage improvement in TNSS and mini-RQLQ scores of 39.5% (12.1) and 24.6% (28.5), respectively. Patients who had been prescribed a nasal anticholinergic for management prior to PNN cryoablation had statistically significantly increased improvement in mini-RQLQ scores from pre- to post-procedure (P = .0387).ConclusionSurgical cryoablation of the PNN significantly improves both symptoms and disease-specific QOL in majority of patients with AR and NAR."
"HIBEL, Leah C","Studying caregiver-infant co-regulation in dynamic, diverse cultural contexts: A call to action","Caregivers and infants co-regulate their physiology, emotions, and behavior in a way that is dynamically responsive to each other and the contexts in which they live. This paper is an introduction and call to action for researchers interested in understanding how to study caregiver-infant interactions in the home and diverse cultural contexts, including marginalized communities. We argue that research will be more valid, culturally relevant, and tapped-in to the daily lives of caregivers and infants if there is partnership and collaboration with the caregivers in the design of the questions, data collection and analysis, and distribution of the findings. We recommend dynamically assessing emotions, behaviors, and physiology using repeated sampling methods including ecological momentary assessments (EMA), salivary bioscience, and actigraphy. We aim to extend current practices of studying caregiver-infant co-regulation by measuring fluctuations of daily life and considering sociocultural factors that shape naturalistic caregiver-infant interactions. Using methodological advancements and community-based participatory research approaches can enable developmental scientists to measure life as it is actually lived."

The outbreak involved 31 performance horses. Horses were monitored over a period of 35 days for clinical signs, therapeutic outcome and qPCR results of EHV-1 in blood and nasal secretions. The morbidity of the EHV-1 outbreak was 84% with 26 clinically infected horses displaying fever and less frequently anorexia and distal limb edema. Four horses showed mild transient neurological deficits. Clinically diseased horses experienced high viral load of EHV-1 in blood and/or nasal secretions via qPCR, while subclinically infected horses had detectable EHV-1 mainly in nasal secretions. The majority of infected horses showed a rise in antibody titers to EHV-1 during the outbreak. All 31 horses were treated with valacyclovir, while clinically infected horses further received flunixin meglumine and sodium heparin. This investigation highlights various relevant aspects of an EHV-1 outbreak caused by a new H752 genotype: (i) importance of early detection of EHV-1 infection; (ii) diagnostic challenge to assess H752 genotype; (iii) apparent benefit of valacyclovir use in the early stage of the outbreak; and (iv) weekly testing of blood and nasal secretions by qPCR in order to monitor individual infection status and lift quarantine."
"MOHAPATRA, Prasant",Escaping saddle-point faster under interpolation-like conditions,"In this paper, we show that under over-parametrization several standard stochastic optimization algorithms escape saddle-points and converge to local-minimizers much faster. One of the fundamental aspects of over-parametrized models is that they are capable of interpolating the training data. We show that, under interpolation-like assumptions satisfied by the stochastic gradients in an over-parametrization setting, the first-order oracle complexity of Perturbed Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD) algorithm to reach an ?-local-minimizer, matches the corresponding deterministic rate of Ã•(1/ ?2). We next analyze Stochastic Cubic-Regularized Newton (SCRN) algorithm under interpolation-like conditions, and show that the oracle complexity to reach an ?-local-minimizer under interpolation-like conditions, is Ã•(1/ ?2.5). While this obtained complexity is better than the corresponding complexity of either PSGD, or SCRN without interpolation-like assumptions, it does not match the rate of Ã•(1/ ?1.5) corresponding to deterministic Cubic-Regularized Newton method. It seems further Hessian-based interpolation-like assumptions are necessary to bridge this gap. We also discuss the corresponding improved complexities in the zeroth-order settings."

Such diseases cause Ëœ17% of all human deaths and their management and control places an immense burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Traditional approaches for the prevention and control of infectious diseases include vaccination programmes, hygiene measures and drugs that suppress the pathogen, treat the disease symptoms or attenuate aggressive reactions of the host immune system. The provision of vaccines and biologic drugs such as antibodies is hampered by the high cost and limited scalability of traditional manufacturing platforms based on microbial and animal cells, particularly in developing countries where infectious diseases are prevalent and poorly controlled. Molecular farming, which uses plants for protein expression, is a promising strategy to address the drawbacks of current manufacturing platforms. In this review article, we consider the potential of molecular farming to address healthcare demands for the most prevalent and important epidemic and pandemic diseases, focussing on recent outbreaks of high-mortality coronavirus infections and diseases that disproportionately affect the developing world."

This volume of flush may not be adequate to push epinephrine to the right atrium in the absence of intrinsic cardiac activity during CC. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of 1-mL and 2.5-mL flush volumes after UVC epinephrine administration on the incidence and time to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in a near-term ovine model of perinatal asphyxia induced cardiac arrest. After 5 min of asystole, lambs were resuscitated per Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines. During resuscitation, lambs received epinephrine through a UVC followed by 1-mL or 2.5-mL normal saline flush. Hemodynamics and plasma epinephrine concentrations were monitored. Three out of seven (43%) and 12/15 (80%) lambs achieved ROSC after the first dose of epinephrine with 1-mL and 2.5-mL flush respectively (p = 0.08). Median time to ROSC and cumulative epinephrine dose required were not different. Plasma epinephrine concentrations at 1 min after epinephrine administration were not different. From our pilot study, higher flush volume after first dose of epinephrine may be of benefit during neonatal resuscitation. More translational and clinical trials are needed."

We have shown that secondary BC has unique characteristics and decreased survival compared with primary BC in adolescent and young adults (AYA; 15-39 years old). However, older BC populations are less well studied.MethodsFemales (age â‰¥ 15 years) diagnosed with primary BC during 1991-2015 (n = 377,167) and enrolled in the California Cancer Registry were compared with those with secondary BC (n = 37,625) by age (15-39, 40-64, â‰¥ 65 years). We examined BC-specific survival (BCSS) accounting for other causes of death as a competing risk using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.ResultsMost secondary BC patients were of older age (15-39, n = 777; 40-64, n = 15,848; â‰¥ 65, n = 21,000). Compared with primary BC treatment, secondary BCs were more often treated with mastectomy and less often with chemotherapy and/or radiation. BCSS was shorter in secondary BC patients than primary BC patients, but the survival difference between secondary and primary BC diminished with age [15-39 hazard ratio (HR): 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83-2.39; 40-64 HR: 1.51; 95% CI 1.44-1.58; â‰¥ 65 HR: 1.14; 95% CI 1.10-1.19]. Survival differences were most pronounced in women with hormone receptor positive disease and Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islanders 40-64 years of age.ConclusionsWhen BC is diagnosed following a prior cancer of any organ site, BCSS is worse than when compared with patients for whom BC is the primary diagnosis, suggesting that we may need to tailor our treatments for women with secondary BC."
"BARBATO, Michele",Climate change effects on the performance of single-family residential buildings in the US Gulf Coast,"The US Gulf Coast is often struck by severe hurricane events. These natural events can cause massive economic and life losses. Based on the projected increase in global sea surface temperature and in population residing along the US Gulf Coast region, the intensity of future hurricanes is expected to increase with time in conjunction with an increase in vulnerability, leading to a significant increase of the risk for future catastrophic hurricane events. Therefore, there is an urgent research need for hurricane risk assessment and mitigation techniques that can quantify the effects of climate change. This paper presents a comprehensive statistical model to account for the effects of climate change on hurricane wind hazard. The model is based on a linear regression of historical hurricane characteristics versus historical sea surface temperature at the time and location of the hurricanes. The proposed model is validated by comparing the simulated hurricane wind speed distributions at any given site along the US Gulf Coast with the wind speed data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The validated wind speed model is used, in conjunction with the future climatological scenarios proposed by the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to forecast future hurricane wind speed distributions along the US Gulf Coast. These wind speed distributions are used within a multilayer Monte Carlo simulation implementation of the Performance-Based Hurricane Engineering framework to estimate potential hurricane-induced losses for a single-family residential building located near Miami, FL. The loss analysis results show that the expected hurricane-induced losses could increase by up to 35% under the projected worst-case scenario in 2060 when compared to the expected losses corresponding to the 2015 climatological conditions."

Remote sensing has been used to monitor the long-term impacts of drought; however, discriminating dead from live trees in arid and semiarid deciduous woodlands is challenging. The goals of this study were to assess and map the spatial patterns of drought-induced tree mortality in a blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodland, a highly drought-tolerant species forming savannas along the lower foothills surrounding California's Central Valley. Airborne hyperspectral imagery was used to identify the most important wavelength regions predicting drought-induced blue oak mortality. The best metric to predict canopy stress was a normalized ratio using the spectral bands 937.53 and 1100.08&nbsp;nm with a correlation with tree mortality of R2&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.83. The image prediction of mortality for nine field plots found that 16 of 98 trees died (17.9%) during the drought. We further evaluated tree mortality in 82 independent plots, and we found the greatest image predictive accuracy for tree mortality between 1% and 10%. When applied at the landscape level, the regression-based index found mortality ranged from 1% to more than 51% in oak stands with an average mortality of 10% over the entire study region. In addition, tree mortality at landscape level showed higher tree mortality in blue oaks on south-facing aspects probably because of higher insolation rates and in sites with low potential for accumulated drainage."

"ZHU, Kan",Quantifying the impact of electric fields on single-cell motility,"Cell motility in response to environmental cues forms the basis of many developmental processes in multicellular organisms. One such environmental cue is an electric field (EF), which induces a form of motility known as electrotaxis. Electrotaxis has evolved in a number of cell types to guide wound healing and has been associated with different cellular processes, suggesting that observed electrotactic behavior is likely a combination of multiple distinct effects arising from the presence of an EF. To determine the different mechanisms by which observed electrotactic behavior emerges, and thus to design EFs that can be applied to direct and control electrotaxis, researchers require accurate quantitative predictions of cellular responses to externally applied fields. Here, we use mathematical modeling to formulate and parameterize a variety of hypothetical descriptions of how cell motility may change in response to an EF. We calibrate our model to observed data using synthetic likelihoods and Bayesian sequential learning techniques and demonstrate that EFs bias cellular motility through only one of a selection of hypothetical mechanisms. We also demonstrate how the model allows us to make predictions about cellular motility under different EFs. The resulting model and calibration methodology will thus form the basis for future data-driven and model-based feedback control strategies based on electric actuation."

"RAST, Philippe",The Identification of Regions of Significance in the Effect of Multimorbidity on Depressive Symptoms Using Longitudinal Data: An Application of the Johnson-Neyman Technique,"BackgroundThe investigation of multimorbidity and aging is complex and highly intertwined with aging-related changes in physical and cognitive capabilities, and mental health and is known to affect psychological distress and quality of life. Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the effects of chronic conditions evolve over time relative to aging-related and end-of-life changes. The identification of periods in time where multimorbidity impacts particular outcomes such as depressive symptoms, versus periods of time where this is not the case, reduces the complexity of the phenomenon.ObjectiveWe present the Johnson-Neyman (J-N) technique in the context of a curvilinear longitudinal model with higher-order terms to probe moderators and to identify regions of statistical significance. In essence, the J-N technique allows one to identify conditions under which moderators impact an outcome from conditions where these effects are not significant.MethodsTo illustrate the use of the J-N technique in a longitudinal sample, we used data from the Health and Retirement Study. Analyses were based on time-to-death models including participants who died within the study duration of 12 years.ResultsMultimorbidity differentially affects rates of change in depression. For some periods in time the effects are statistically significant while in other periods the same effects are not statistically different from zero.ConclusionThe J-N technique is useful to continuously probe moderating effects and to identify particular interactions with the model for time when certain effects are or are not statistically significant. In the context of multimorbidity this method is particularly useful for interpreting the complex interactions with differential change over time."

We defined maternal nativity as US-born or foreign-born. Using Poisson regression, we computed risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for three adverse perinatal outcomes: preterm birth, small for gestational age deliveries, and infant mortality.ResultsRates of adverse perinatal outcomes were significantly higher among US-born Black women. In adjusted models, US-born Black women experienced an increased risk of preterm birth (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.39, 1.65) and small for gestational age deliveries (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.41, 1.64), compared to foreign-born Black women.ConclusionsFuture studies should consider experiences of racism across the life course when exploring heterogeneity in the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes by nativity among Black women in the US."
"BOBINSKI, Matthew",Enrollment with and without exception from informed consent in a pilot trial of tranexamic acid in children with hemorrhagic injuries,"BackgroundFederal exception from informed consent (EFIC) procedures allow studies to enroll patients with time-sensitive, life-threatening conditions when written consent is not feasible. Our objective was to compare enrollment rates with and without EFIC in a trial of tranexamic acid (TXA) for children with hemorrhagic injuries.MethodsWe conducted a four-center randomized controlled pilot and feasibility trial evaluating TXA in children with severe hemorrhagic brain and/or torso injuries. We initiated the trial enrolling patients without EFIC. After 3&nbsp;months of enrollment, we met our a priori futility threshold and paused the trial to incorporate EFIC procedures and obtain regulatory approval. We then restarted the trial allowing EFIC if the guardian was unable to provide timely written consent. We used descriptive statistics to compare characteristics of eligible patients approached with and without EFIC procedures. We also calculated the time delay to restart the trial using EFIC.ResultsWe enrolled one of 15 (6.7%) eligible patients (0.17 per site per month) prior to using EFIC procedures. Of the 14 missed eligible patients, seven (50%) were not enrolled because guardians were not present or were injured and unable to provide written consent. After obtaining approval for EFIC, we enrolled 30 of 48 (62.5%) eligible patients (1.34 per site per month). Of these 30 patients, 22 (73.3%) were enrolled with EFIC. Of the 22, no guardians refused written consent after randomization. There were no significant differences in the eligibility rate and patient characteristics enrolled with and without EFIC procedures. Across all sites, the mean delay to restart the trial using EFIC procedures was 12&nbsp;months.ConclusionsIn a multicenter trial of severely injured children, the use of EFIC procedures greatly increased the enrollment rate and was well accepted by guardians. Initiating the trial without EFIC procedures led to a significant delay in enrollment."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the most common (90%) and aggressive type of pancreatic cancer. Genomic analyses of PDA specimens have identified the recurrent genetic mutations that drive PDA initiation and progression. However, the underlying mechanisms that further drive PDA metastasis remain elusive. Despite many attempts, no recurrent genetic mutation driving PDA metastasis has been found, suggesting that PDA metastasis is driven by epigenetic fluctuations rather than genetic factors. Therefore, establishing epigenetic mechanisms of PDA metastasis would facilitate the development of successful therapeutic interventions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview on the role of epigenetic mechanisms in PDA as a critical contributor on PDA progression and metastasis. In particular, we explore the recent advancements elucidating the role of nucleosome remodeling, histone modification, and DNA methylation in the process of cancer metastasis."

Eighteen concrete block specimens were constructed, each with dimensions of 350Ã—300Ã—150 mm and grooves cut on one side to embed the NSM reinforcement. Sinusoidal waveform fatigue loading with a range of 10-50% of the corresponding static bond strength was applied with the number of cycles varying from 0 to 10, 000, which was then followed by static pull-out test to determine the local bond-slip relationship between the NSM reinforcement and concrete. It was found that specimens mostly failed due to the breakage of concrete and epoxy. As the number of fatigue cycles increased, the local bond strength decreased substantially. Based on the experimental data, an empirical degradation equation was also proposed for bond strength prediction with respect to the number of fatigue cycles."

Previously, we confirmed the interaction of fatty acids and acylcarnitines with Oxy-Myoglobin, using both molecular dynamic simulations and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry studies. However, those studies were limited to testing only the binding sites derived from homology to fatty acid binding proteins and predictions using automated docking. To explore the entry mechanisms of the lipid ligands into myoglobin, we conducted molecular dynamic simulations of murine Oxy- and Deoxy-Mb structures with palmitate or palmitoylcarnitine starting at different positions near the protein surface. The simulations indicated that both ligands readily (under âˆ¼10-20 ns) enter the Oxy-Mb structure through a dynamic area (""portal region"") near heme, known to be the entry point for small molecule gaseous ligands like O2, CO and NO. The entry is not observed with Deoxy-Mb where lipid ligands move away from protein surface, due to a compaction of the entry portal and the heme-containing crevice in the Mb protein upon O2 removal. The results suggest quick spontaneous binding of lipids to Mb driven by hydrophobic interactions, strongly enhanced by oxygenation, and consistent with the emergent role of Mb in lipid metabolism."

"YAMADA, Soichiro",Condensation of pericentrin proteins in human cells illuminates phase separation in centrosome assembly.,"At the onset of mitosis, centrosomes expand the pericentriolar material (PCM) to maximize their microtubule-organizing activity. This step, termed centrosome maturation, ensures proper spindle organization and faithful chromosome segregation. However, as the centrosome expands, how PCM proteins are recruited and held together without membrane enclosure remains elusive. We found that endogenously expressed pericentrin (PCNT), a conserved PCM scaffold protein, condenses into dynamic granules during late G2/early mitosis before incorporating into mitotic centrosomes. Furthermore, the N-terminal portion of PCNT, enriched with conserved coiled-coils (CCs) and low-complexity regions (LCRs), phase separates into dynamic condensates that selectively recruit PCM proteins and nucleate microtubules in cells. We propose that CCs and LCRs, two prevalent sequence features in the centrosomal proteome, are preserved under evolutionary pressure in part to mediate liquid-liquid phase separation, a process that bestows upon the centrosome distinct properties critical for its assembly and functions."

An objective marker is needed to track consumption of supplements to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to evaluate saccharin and resveratrol as potential adherence markers for tracking recent consumption of a single serving of SQ-LNS in women.MethodsForty-seven healthy nonpregnant women 18-45 y of age were assigned to consume a single dose of SQ-LNS (20&nbsp;g) containing either 10&nbsp;mg sodium saccharin or 5&nbsp;mg trans-resveratrol, under supervision. On the day before and for 2 d following SQ-LNS consumption, urine samples were collected each day for 24 h as 3 consecutive 4-h collections and one 12-h overnight collection. Urinary concentrations of saccharin and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, a resveratrol metabolite, were measured by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography interfaced to a mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization [UHPLC-(ESI-)MS/MS]. Urinary concentrations (Î¼mol/L urine) of saccharin and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate were plotted against time, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the discriminative capacity of each compound, at each post-consumption time point compared with baseline, to detect recent consumption of SQ-LNS. Cutoff values to differentiate supplement consumption from nonconsumption of each marker were developed using the closest-to-(0,1)-corner cut-point approach.ResultsForty-five participants were included in the analysis. Urinary concentrations of saccharin and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate increased within 4 h of SQ-LNS consumption. Urinary concentration cutoff values for saccharin (13.4&nbsp;Âµmol/L) and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate (0.7&nbsp;Âµmol/L) allowed for 78% and 89% sensitivity, respectively, and 100% specificity in detecting consumption of SQ-LNS within the first 12&nbsp;h after consumption.ConclusionsUrinary concentrations of saccharin and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate reflect consumption of SQ-LNS containing those compounds during the first 12&nbsp;h post-consumption with high sensitivity and specificity in healthy women and may be useful objective adherence markers for tracking consumption of SQ-LNS."
"GALLARDO, Rodrigo A","Infectious Bronchitis Virus Prevalence, Characterization, and Strain Identification in California Backyard Chickens.","Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes significant losses in the poultry industry throughout the world. Here we characterize the lesions of infectious bronchitis (IB) and IBV prevalence and identify the circulating strains in small flocks in California. Backyard chickens (BYCs) submitted to the Davis (Northern California; NorCal) and San Bernardino (Southern California; SoCal) branches of the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System from January through March 2019 were included in the study. Trachea, kidney, and cecal tonsils were collected for real-time reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and sequence analysis. A total of 50 chickens out of 169 submissions tested positive for IBV by qRT-PCR. Of these, 16% (20/123) were from NorCal and 65% (30/46) from SoCal laboratory. The cecal tonsil was the most frequently positive tissue by qRT-PCR and IHC. Lymphoplasmacytic tracheitis was the most frequent histopathologic finding in 24 of 39 birds, while the kidney showed interstitial nephritis, tubular necrosis, tubular dilation, and/or gout in 14 of 43 chickens. Infectious bronchitis virus played a primary role or a synergistic effect in the mortality of chickens that succumbed to other infectious diseases. The sequences of IBV detected in 22 birds were analyzed, and 14 strains were most similar to CA1737. One strain each matched Conn46, Cal99, and ArkDPI, and the remaining five did not have a substantial match to any available reference strains. The findings in this study indicate that small flocks can be reservoirs of IBV and might facilitate evolution of new variants as well as reversion of attenuated strains to virulence."

  holography","We discuss the physics of momentum diffusion in a charged plasma. Following
the holographic strategy outlined in arXiv:2012.03999 we construct an open
effective field theory for the low-lying modes of the conserved currents. The
charged plasma is modeled holographically in terms of a Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS
black hole. We analyze graviton and photon fluctuations about this background,
decoupling in the process the long-lived momentum diffusion mode from the
short-lived charged transport mode. Furthermore, as in the aforementioned
reference, we argue that the dynamics of these modes are captured by a set of
designer scalars in the background geometry. These scalars have their
gravitational coupling modulated by an auxiliary dilaton with long-lived modes
being weakly coupled near the spacetime asymptopia. Aided by these
observations, we obtain the quadratic effective action that governs the
fluctuating hydrodynamics of charge current and stress tensor, reproducing in
the process transport data computed previously. We also point out an
interesting length scale lying between the inner and outer horizon radii of the
charged black hole associated with Ohmic conductivity."

"RUNDLE, John B",Tsunami Squares: Earthquake driven inundation mapping and validation by comparison to the Regional Ocean Modeling System,"A promising tsunami warning system outlined here links Total Electron Content (TEC) disturbances in the ionosphere detected by GNSS satellites to maps of inundated areas along the affected coastlines. This will be accomplished through a pipeline of earthquake, ionosphere, and tsunami simulations. The focus of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of our tsunami simulator for use in this simulation pipeline. The simulator we have developed is called Tsunami Squares, a computationally inexpensive program that employs a unique method of propagating water according to shallow water theory. Unlike other wave simulators, Tsunami Squares can easily propagate waves from sea to land, allowing flooded areas along the coast to be mapped. To validate its accuracy, a comparison is made to the Regional Ocean Modeling System tsunami simulator, which solves the Navier Stokes equations directly using a finite-difference method. The two simulation techniques show good agreement when compared over the 2011 Japan event and the 2010 Chile event. In addition, examples of inundation plots are displayed here to demonstrate its capability for such a warning system."

In particular, single-cell transcriptomics has led to fundamental new insights into animal biology, such as the discovery of new cell types and cell type-specific disease processes. However, the application of single-cell approaches to plants, fungi, algae, or bacteria (environmental organisms) has been far more limited, largely due to the challenges posed by polysaccharide walls surrounding these species' cells. In this perspective, we discuss opportunities afforded by single-cell technologies for energy and environmental science and grand challenges that must be tackled to apply these approaches to plants, fungi and algae. We highlight the need to develop better and more comprehensive single-cell technologies, analysis and visualization tools, and tissue preparation methods. We advocate for the creation of a centralized, open-access database to house plant single-cell data. Finally, we consider how such efforts should balance the need for deep characterization of select model species while still capturing the diversity in the plant kingdom. Investments into the development of methods, their application to relevant species, and the creation of resources to support data dissemination will enable groundbreaking insights to propel energy and environmental science forward."
"KO, Christopher Y",CaMKIIÎ´ post-translational modifications increase affinity for calmodulin inside cardiac ventricular myocytes,"Persistent over-activation of CaMKII (Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent protein Kinase II) in the heart is implicated in arrhythmias, heart failure, pathological remodeling, and other cardiovascular diseases. Several post-translational modifications (PTMs)-including autophosphorylation, oxidation, S-nitrosylation, and O-GlcNAcylation-have been shown to trap CaMKII in an autonomously active state. The molecular mechanisms by which these PTMs regulate calmodulin (CaM) binding to CaMKIIÎ´-the primary cardiac isoform-has not been well-studied particularly in its native myocyte environment. Typically, CaMKII activates upon Ca-CaM binding during locally elevated [Ca]free and deactivates upon Ca-CaM dissociation when [Ca]free returns to basal levels. To assess the effects of CaMKIIÎ´ PTMs on CaM binding, we developed a novel FRET (FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer) approach to directly measure CaM binding to and dissociation from CaMKIIÎ´ in live cardiac myocytes. We demonstrate that autophosphorylation of CaMKIIÎ´ increases affinity for CaM in its native environment and that this increase is dependent on [Ca]free. This leads to a 3-fold slowing of CaM dissociation from CaMKIIÎ´ (time constant slows from ~0.5 to 1.5&nbsp;s) when [Ca]free is reduced with physiological kinetics. Moreover, oxidation further slows CaM dissociation from CaMKIIÎ´ T287D (phosphomimetic) upon rapid [Ca]free chelation and increases FRET between CaM and CaMKIIÎ´ T287A (phosphoresistant). The CaM dissociation kinetics-measured here in myocytes-are similar to the interval between heartbeats, and integrative memory would be expected as a function of heart rate. Furthermore, the PTM-induced slowing of dissociation between beats would greatly promote persistent CaMKIIÎ´ activity in the heart. Together, these findings suggest a significant role of PTM-induced changes in CaMKIIÎ´ affinity for CaM and memory under physiological and pathophysiological processes in the heart."

Using an environment-sensitive dye anchored within the ligand shell as a sensor of membrane embedding, we demonstrate that particles with core sizes of âˆ¼2-3 nm are capable of embedding within and penetrating fluid bilayers. At the nanoscale, these particles also promote spontaneous fusion of liposomes or spontaneously embed within intact liposomal vesicles. These studies provide nanoparticle design and selection principles that could be used in drug delivery applications, as membrane stains, or for the creation of novel organic/inorganic nanomaterial self-assemblies."
"PANDIT, Pranav S",Evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants,"The emergence of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and more recently, the independent evolution of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants has generated renewed interest in virus evolution and cross-species transmission. While all known human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are speculated to have originated in animals, very little is known about their evolutionary history and factors that enable some CoVs to co-exist with humans as low pathogenic and endemic infections (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1), while others, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have evolved to cause severe disease. In this review, we highlight the origins of all known HCoVs and map positively selected for mutations within HCoV proteins to discuss the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we discuss emerging mutations within SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern (VOC), along with highlighting the demonstrated or speculated impact of these mutations on virus transmission, pathogenicity, and neutralization by natural or vaccine-mediated immunity."
"KIM, Isaac H",Constructing local integrals of motion in the many-body localized phase,"Many-body localization provides a generic mechanism of ergodicity breaking in
quantum systems. In contrast to conventional ergodic systems, many-body
localized (MBL) systems are characterized by extensively many local integrals
of motion (LIOM), which underlie the absence of transport and thermalization in
these systems. Here we report a physically motivated construction of local
integrals of motion in the MBL phase. We show that any local operator (e.g., a
local particle number or a spin flip operator), evolved with the system's
Hamiltonian and averaged over time, becomes a LIOM in the MBL phase. Such
operators have a clear physical meaning, describing the response of the MBL
system to a local perturbation. In particular, when a local operator represents
a density of some globally conserved quantity, the corresponding LIOM describes
how this conserved quantity propagates through the MBL phase. Being uniquely
defined and experimentally measurable, these LIOMs provide a natural tool for
characterizing the properties of the MBL phase, both in experiments and
numerical simulations. We demonstrate the latter by numerically constructing an
extensive set of LIOMs in the MBL phase of a disordered spin chain model. We
show that the resulting LIOMs are quasi-local, and use their decay to extract
the localization length and establish the location of the transition between
the MBL and ergodic phases."

A recent analysis of the inclusions in FXTAS demonstrates elevated levels of several proteins, including small ubiquitin-related modifiers 1/2 (SUMO1/2), that target molecules for the proteasome, suggesting that some aspect(s) of proteasomal function may be altered in FXTAS. Recent neuropathological studies show that Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease can sometimes co-occur with FXTAS. Lewy bodies can be found in 10% of the brains of patients with FXTAS. Microbleeds and iron deposition are also common in the neuropathology, in addition to white matter disease (WMD) and atrophy.SummaryThe premutation occurs in 1:200 females and 1:400 males. Penetrance for FXTAS increases with age, though lower in females (16%) compared to over 60% of males by age 70. To diagnose FXTAS, an MRI is essential to document the presence of WMD, a primary component of the diagnostic criteria. Pain can be a significant feature of FXTAS and is seen in approximately 50% of patients."
"AHN, Shirley",A glycan gate controls opening of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is controlled by the opening of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), which transitions from a glycan-shielded 'down' to an exposed 'up' state to bind the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and infect cells. While snapshots of the 'up' and 'down' states have been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomagraphy, details of the RBD-opening transition evade experimental characterization. Here over 130 Âµs of weighted ensemble simulations of the fully glycosylated spike ectodomain allow us to characterize more than 300 continuous, kinetically unbiased RBD-opening pathways. Together with ManifoldEM analysis of cryo-electron microscopy data and biolayer interferometry experiments, we reveal a gating role for the N-glycan at position N343, which facilitates RBD opening. Residues D405, R408 and D427 also participate. The atomic-level characterization of the glycosylated spike activation mechanism provided herein represents a landmark study for ensemble pathway simulations and offers a foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infection."

"VANNETTE, Rachel",Orchard Management and Landscape Context Mediate the Pear Floral Microbiome,"Crop-associated microbiota are a key factor affecting host health and productivity. Most crops are grown within heterogeneous landscapes, and interactions between management practices and landscape context often affect plant and animal biodiversity in agroecosystems. However, whether these same factors typically affect crop-associated microbiota is less clear. Here, we assessed whether orchard management strategies and landscape context affected bacterial and fungal communities in pear (Pyrus communis) flowers. We found that bacteria and fungi responded differently to management schemes. Organically certified orchards had higher fungal diversity in flowers than conventional or bio-based integrated pest management (IPM) orchards, but organic orchards had the lowest bacterial diversity. Orchard management scheme also best predicted the distribution of several important bacterial and fungal genera that either cause or suppress disease; organic and bio-based IPM best explained the distributions of bacterial and fungal genera, respectively. Moreover, patterns of bacterial and fungal diversity were affected by interactions between management, landscape context, and climate. When examining the similarity of bacterial and fungal communities across sites, both abundance- and taxon-related turnovers were mediated primarily by orchard management scheme and landscape context and, specifically, the amount of land in cultivation. Our study reveals local- and landscape-level drivers of floral microbiome structure in a major fruit crop, providing insights that can inform microbiome management to promote host health and high-yielding quality fruit. IMPORTANCE Proper crop management during bloom is essential for producing disease-free tree fruit. Tree fruits are often grown in heterogeneous landscapes; however, few studies have assessed whether landscape context and crop management affect the floral microbiome, which plays a critical role in shaping plant health and disease tolerance. Such work is key for identification of tactics and/or contexts where beneficial microbes proliferate and pathogenic microbes are limited. Here, we characterize the floral microbiome of pear crops in Washington State, where major production occurs in intermountain valleys and basins with variable elevation and microclimates. Our results show that both local-level (crop management) and landscape-level (habitat types and climate) factors affect floral microbiota but in disparate ways for each kingdom. More broadly, these findings can potentially inform microbiome management in orchards for promotion of host health and high-quality yields."
"CHEN, Chao-Yin",Secondhand Smoke Exposure Impairs Ion Channel Function and Contractility of Mesenteric Arteries,"Cigarette smoke, including secondhand smoke (SHS), has significant detrimental vascular effects, but its effects on myogenic tone of small resistance arteries and the underlying mechanisms are understudied.

The study's goal is to determine the effects of SHS on mesenteric arterial myocyte contractility and excitability. C57BL/6J&nbsp;male mice were randomly assigned to either filtered air (FA) or SHS (6 h/d, 5 d/wk) exposed groups for a 4, 8, or 12-weeks period. Third and fourth-order mesenteric arteries and arterial myocytes were acutely isolated and evaluated with pressure myography and patch clamp electrophysiology, respectively. Myogenic tone was found to be elevated in mesenteric arteries from mice exposed to SHS for 12 wk but not for 4 or 8 wk. These results were correlated with an increase in L-type Ca2+ channel activity in mesenteric arterial myocytes after 12 wk of SHS exposure. Moreover, 12 wk SHS exposed arterial myocytes have reduced total potassium channel current density, which correlates with a depolarized membrane potential (Vm). These results suggest that SHS exposure induces alterations in key ionic conductances that modulate arterial myocyte contractility and myogenic tone. Thus, chronic exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration of SHS impairs mesenteric arterial myocyte electrophysiology and myogenic tone, which may contribute to increased blood pressure and risks of developing vascular complications due to passive exposure to cigarette smoke."

Independent prognostic factors include race, histology, grade, and size. There is a lack of improvement in survival over the last four decades."
"YOO, Sung-Joo B",Materials for emergent silicon-integrated optical computing,"Progress in computing architectures is approaching a paradigm shift: traditional computing based on digital complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology is nearing physical limits in terms of miniaturization, speed, and, especially, power consumption. Consequently, alternative approaches are under investigation. One of the most promising is based on a ""brain-like"" or neuromorphic computation scheme. Another approach is quantum computing using photons. Both of these approaches can be realized using silicon photonics, and at the heart of both technologies is an efficient, ultra-low power broad band optical modulator. As silicon modulators suffer from relatively high power consumption, materials other than silicon itself have to be considered for the modulator. In this Perspective, we present our view on such materials. We focus on oxides showing a strong linear electro-optic effect that can also be integrated with Si, thus capitalizing on new materials to enable the devices and circuit architectures that exploit shifting computational machine learning paradigms, while leveraging current manufacturing infrastructure. This is expected to result in a new generation of computers that consume less power and possess a larger bandwidth."

"TYLER, Katren R",Cervical Spine Injuries in Older Patients with Falls Found on Magnetic Resonance Imaging After Computed Tomography,"Introduction: In this study we aimed to determine the rate of traumatic abnormalities on cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after a normal cervical spine computed tomography (CT) in older patients with ground-level falls. We hypothesized that MRI is low yield following a normal physical examination and normal CT after a ground-level fall.&nbsp; 
      Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients 65 years and older evaluated with a cervical spine MRI following a ground-level fall. Inclusion criteria included age 65 years and older, ground-level fall, normal cervical spine CT followed by a cervical spine MRI. We abstracted data following accepted methodologic guidelines. Patients with any focal neurological finding were considered to have an abnormal neurological examination. Imaging studies were considered to be abnormal if there was a report of an acute traumatic injury. The primary outcome was a traumatic abnormality identified on MRI. We described data with simple descriptive statistics.&nbsp;
      Results: Eighty-seven patients with a median age of 74 (interquartile range [IQR] 69, 83]) years had an MRI following a normal cervical spine CT. Median emergency department length of stay was 8.2 hours (IQR 5.3, 13.5). Sixty-four (73.6%) patients had a normal neurological examination on arrival; eight of these patients (12.5% (95% confidenced interval [CI], 5.6-23.2%) had an abnormal cervical spine MRI. Twenty-three patients (26.4%) had an abnormal neurological examination on arrival; two of these patients (8.7%, 95% CI, 1.1-28%) had an abnormal cervical spine MRI. Overall, 10 patients (11.5%) had an abnormal cervical spine MRI. One patient underwent operative intervention due to an unstable injury. Of the remaining nine patients with acute findings on cervical spine MRI, there were no other unstable injuries; two patients were managed with cervical orthosis, and seven patients had no additional management.&nbsp;
      Conclusion: In this study of older patients with ground-level falls and normal, atraumatic, cervical spine CT, a small portion had traumatic abnormalities on MRI, with few requiring further intervention. Further study is required to identify criteria to determine when MRI should be performed in older patients after a ground-level fall.&nbsp;"

"DRAKE, Christiana M",Factors Associated With Cannabis Use During the Reproductive Cycle: A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study of Women in States With Recreational and Medical Cannabis Legalization.,"IntroductionPassage of cannabis laws may impact cannabis use and the use of other substances. The suggested association is of particular concern in pregnant women where exposure to substances can cause harm to both the pregnant woman and fetus. The present study contributes to the minimal literature on factors associated with cannabis use during the preconception, prenatal, and postpartum periods including state legalization status, concurrent use of tobacco and e-cigarettes and adequacy of prenatal care.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis using combined survey data from the 2016-2018 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) collected from 36,391 women. Logistic regression was used to estimate the impact of state-legalization, adequacy of prenatal care, and other substance use on cannabis use during the preconception, prenatal, and post-partum periods.ResultsIn the preconception model, residence in a recreationally legal state (OR: 2.37; 95% CI, 2.04-2.75) or medically legal state (OR:3.32; 95% CI, 2.90-3.80) compared to a non-legal state was associated with higher odds of cannabis use. In the prenatal model, residence in a recreationally legal state was associated with higher odds of cannabis use (OR: 1.51; 95% CI, 1.29-1.79) whereas there was no association with residence in a medically legal state. Tobacco use including e-cigarettes and moderate prenatal alcohol use were also significantly associated with cannabis use.ConclusionRecreational cannabis legalization is associated with the use of cannabis prior to, during, and after pregnancy. Renewed clinical and policy efforts may be warranted to update prenatal substance use prevention programs, educational campaigns, and provider education as cannabis legalization evolves."
"CHENG, R Holland H","Soluble CD40L activates soluble and cell-surface integrin Î±vÎ²3, Î±5Î²1, and Î±4Î²1 by binding to the allosteric ligand-binding site (site 2)","CD40L is a member of the TNF superfamily that participates in immune cell activation. It binds to and signals through several integrins, including Î±vÎ²3 and Î±5Î²1, which bind to the trimeric interface of CD40L. We previously showed that several integrin ligands can bind to the allosteric site (site 2), which is distinct from the classical ligand-binding site (site 1), raising the question of if CD40L activates integrins. In our explorations of this question, we determined that integrin Î±4Î²1, which is prevalently expressed on the same CD4+ T cells as CD40L, is another receptor for CD40L. Soluble (s)CD40L activated soluble integrins Î±vÎ²3, Î±5Î²1, and Î±4Î²1 in cell-free conditions, indicating that this activation does not require inside-out signaling. Moreover, sCD40L activated cell-surface integrins in CHO cells that do not express CD40. To learn more about the mechanism of binding, we determined that sCD40L bound to a cyclic peptide from site 2. Docking simulations predicted that the residues of CD40L that bind to site 2 are located outside of the CD40L trimer interface, at a site where four HIGM1 (hyper-IgM syndrome type 1) mutations are clustered. We tested the effect of these mutations, finding that the K143T and G144E mutants were the most defective in integrin activation, providing support that this region interacts with site 2. We propose that allosteric integrin activation by CD40L also plays a role in CD40L signaling, and defective site 2 binding may be related to the impaired CD40L signaling functions of these HIGM1 mutants."
"RISTENPART, William D",Non-respiratory particles emitted by guinea pigs in airborne disease transmission experiments,"Animal models are often used to assess the airborne transmissibility of various pathogens, which are typically assumed to be carried by expiratory droplets emitted directly from the respiratory tract of the infected animal. We recently established that influenza virus is also transmissible via ""aerosolized fomites,"" micron-scale dust particulates released from virus-contaminated surfaces (Asadi et al. in Nat Commun 11(1):4062, 2020). Here we expand on this observation, by counting and characterizing the particles emitted from guinea pig cages using an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) and an Interferometric Mie Imaging (IMI) system. Of over 9000 airborne particles emitted from guinea pig cages and directly imaged with IMI, none had an interference pattern indicative of a liquid droplet. Separate measurements of the particle count using the APS indicate that particle concentrations spike upwards immediately following animal motion, then decay exponentially with a time constant commensurate with the air exchange rate in the cage. Taken together, the results presented here raise the possibility that a non-negligible fraction of airborne influenza transmission events between guinea pigs occurs via aerosolized fomites rather than respiratory droplets, though the relative frequencies of these two routes have yet to be definitively determined."

"IMAI-LEONARD, Denise M",Retinal degeneration in mice and humans with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 8,"BackgroundCeroid lipofuscinosis type 8 belongs to a heterogenous group of vision and life-threatening neurodegenerative diseases, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Effective therapy is limited to a single drug for treatment of ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2, necessitating animal disease models to facilitate further therapeutic development. Murine models are advantageous for therapeutic development due to easy genetic manipulation and rapid breeding, however appropriate genetic models need to be identified and characterized before being used for therapy testing. To date, murine models of ocular disease associated with ceroid lipofuscinosis type 8 have only been characterized in motor neuron degeneration mice.MethodsCln8-/- mice were produced by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium. Ophthalmic examination, optical coherence tomography, electroretinography, and ocular histology was performed on Cln8-/- mice and controls at 16 weeks of age. Quantification of all retinal layers, retinal pigmented epithelium, and the choriocapillaris was performed using images acquired with ocular coherence tomography and planimetry of histologic sections. Necropsy was performed to investigate concurrent systemic abnormalities. Clinical correlation with human patients with CLN8-associated retinopathy is provided.ResultsRetinal degeneration characterized by retinal pigment epithelium mottling, scattered drusen, and retinal vascular attenuation was noted in all Cln8-/- mice. Loss of inner and outer photoreceptor segment demarcation was noted on optical coherence tomography, with significant thinning of the whole retina (P=1e-9), outer nuclear layer (P=1e-9), and combined photoreceptor segments (P=1e-9). A global reduction in scotopic and photopic electroretinographic waveforms was noted in all Cln8-/- mice. Slight thickening of the inner plexiform layer (P=0.02) and inner nuclear layer (P=0.004), with significant thinning of the whole retina (P=0.03), outer nuclear layer (P=0.01), and outer photoreceptor segments (P=0.001) was appreciated on histologic sections. Scattered lipid vacuoles were noted in splenic red pulp of all Cln8-/- mice, though no gross systemic abnormalities were detected on necropsy. Retinal findings are consistent with those seen in patients with ceroid lipofuscinosis type 8.ConclusionsThis study provides detailed clinical characterization of retinopathy in adult Cln8-/- mice. Findings suggest that Cln8-/- mice may provide a useful murine model for development of novel therapeutics needed for treating ocular disease in patients with ceroid lipofuscinosis type 8."

"VAN WINKLE, Laura S",Metabolomics of Lung Microdissections Reveals Region- and Sex-Specific Metabolic Effects of Acute Naphthalene Exposure in Mice,"Naphthalene is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant produced by combustion of fossil fuels and is a primary constituent of both mainstream and side stream tobacco smoke. Naphthalene elicits region-specific toxicity in airway club cells through cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated bioactivation, resulting in depletion of glutathione and subsequent cytotoxicity. Although effects of naphthalene in mice have been extensively studied, few experiments have characterized global metabolomic changes in the lung. In individual lung regions, we found metabolomic changes in microdissected mouse lung conducting airways and parenchyma obtained from animals sacrificed at 3 timepoints following naphthalene treatment. Data on 577 unique identified metabolites were acquired by accurate mass spectrometry-based assays focusing on lipidomics and nontargeted metabolomics of hydrophilic compounds. Statistical analyses revealed distinct metabolite profiles between the 2 lung regions. Additionally, the number and magnitude of statistically significant exposure-induced changes in metabolite abundance were different between airways and parenchyma for unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholines, dipeptides, purines, pyrimidines, and amino acids. Importantly, temporal changes were found to be highly distinct for male and female mice with males exhibiting predominant treatment-specific changes only at 2 h postexposure. In females, metabolomic changes persisted until 6 h postnaphthalene treatment, which may explain the previously characterized higher susceptibility of female mice to naphthalene toxicity. In both males and females, treatment-specific changes corresponding to lung remodeling, oxidative stress response, and DNA damage were observed. Overall, this study provides insights into potential mechanisms contributing to naphthalene toxicity and presents a novel approach for lung metabolomic analysis that distinguishes responses of major lung regions."
"SAIZ, Augustine M",Modified Lumbopelvic Technique Using S1 Pedicle Screws for Spinopelvic Dissociation U-Type and H-Type Sacral Fractures With Kyphotic Deformity,"SummarySpinopelvic dissociation injuries are complex injuries defined as discontinuity between the appendicular and axial skeleton. Fracture patterns are variable, but U-type and H-type fractures are common and often present with kyphotic deformity along with translational displacement and impaction. The ideal method of fixation has not been established for these injuries. The goals of treatment include restoration of alignment, stability, and neural decompression as needed. Traditional methods of lumbopelvic fixation have spanned the upper sacral fracture site. Our novel modified method of lumbopelvic fixation directly instruments the S1 body. This allows for direct manipulation of the fracture which we theorize improves reduction and increases stability across the fracture. This article characterizes the injury patterns, outlines the modified technique, and reports the clinical and radiographic outcomes of our modified lumbopelvic fixation technique and construct."

Although researchers in several studies have explored parent insights into discharge needs, few have explored perceptions of causes for pediatric readmissions. We sought to investigate factors contributing to pediatric readmissions, from both parent and physician perspectives.MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study using semistructured interviews with parents, discharging and readmitting physicians, and subspecialist consultants of children readmitted within 30 days of initial discharge from the pediatric ward at an urban nonfreestanding children's hospital. Participants were interviewed during the readmission and asked about care transition experiences during the initial admission and potential causes and preventability of readmission. Data were analyzed iteratively by using a constant-comparative approach. We identified major themes, solicited feedback, and inferred relationships between themes to develop a conceptual model for preventing readmissions.ResultsWe conducted 53 interviews from 20 patient readmissions, including 20 parents, 20 readmitting physicians, 11 discharging physicians, and 3 consulting subspecialists. Major themes included the following: (1) unclear roles cause lack of ownership in patient care tasks, (2) lack of collaborative communication leads to discordant understanding of care plans, and (3) incomplete hospital-to-home transitions result in ongoing reliance on the hospital.ConclusionsClear definition of team member roles, improved communication among care team members and between care teams and families, and enhanced care coordination to facilitate the hospital-to-home transition were perceived as potential interventions that may help prevent readmissions."
"DIAZ, Samuel L",Black box of phageâ€“bacterium interactions: exploring alternative phage infection strategies,"The canonical lytic-lysogenic binary has been challenged in recent years, as more evidence has emerged on alternative bacteriophage infection strategies. These infection modes are little studied, and yet they appear to be more abundant and ubiquitous in nature than previously recognized, and can play a significant role in the ecology and evolution of their bacterial hosts. In this review, we discuss the extent, causes and consequences of alternative phage lifestyles, and clarify conceptual and terminological confusion to facilitate research progress. We propose distinct definitions for the terms 'pseudolysogeny' and 'productive or non-productive chronic infection', and distinguish them from the carrier state life cycle, which describes a population-level phenomenon. Our review also finds that phages may change their infection modes in response to environmental conditions or the physiological state of the host cell. We outline known molecular mechanisms underlying the alternative phage-host interactions, including specific genetic pathways and their considerable biotechnological potential. Moreover, we discuss potential implications of the alternative phage lifestyles for microbial biology and ecosystem functioning, as well as applied topics such as phage therapy."

An initial set of AUC was reported by the American Society of Dermatopathology (ASDP) in 2018. AUC reflect evidence collected at single timepoints and may be affected by evolving evidence and experience. The objective of this study was to update and expand AUC for selected tests.MethodsRAND/UCLA (RAND Corporation [Santa Monica, CA]/University of California Los Angeles) methodology used includes the following: (a) literature review; (b) review of previously rated tests and previously employed clinical scenarios; (c) selection of previously rated tests for new ratings; (d) development of new clinical scenarios; (e) selection of additional tests; (f) three rating rounds with feedback and group discussion after rounds 1 and 2.ResultsFor 220 clinical scenarios comprising lymphoproliferative (light chain clonality), melanocytic (comparative genomic hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter), vascular disorders (MYC), and inflammatory dermatoses (periodic acid-Schiff, GÃ¶mÃ¶ri methenamine silver), consensus by panel raters was reached in 172 of 220 (78%) scenarios, with 103 of 148 (70%) rated ""usually appropriate"" or ""rarely appropriate"" and 45 of 148 (30%), ""appropriateness uncertain.""LimitationsThe study design only measures appropriateness. Cost, availability, test comparison, and additional clinical considerations are not measured. The possibility that the findings of this study may be influenced by the inherent biases of the dermatopathologists involved in the study cannot be excluded.ConclusionsAUC are reported for selected diagnostic tests in clinical scenarios that occur in dermatopathology practice.

"YOUNIS, Bassam",Computations and measurements of the global drag force on a Tension-Leg Platform,"We present experimental and computational results for the global drag force on a model Tension-Leg Platform (TLP) in uniform current for various values of the Reynolds number in the subcritical regime (Re = 104 - 1.06Ã—105). The objective of the experiments, which were performed in a towing tank on a representative TLP configuration, was to provide data suitable for validating numerical model predictions. The purpose of the simulations was to determine the extent to which Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), when used as a truly predictive tool, can be relied upon to provide reliable estimates of the total drag force. Thus the simulations were performed only once with no further computations performed in order to bring about closer agreement with the measurements. The dependence of the computed results on the numerical grid was checked using the Grid-Convergence Index (GCI) method applied to results from benchmark flows. These results also served to assess the dependence on the value of the Smagorinsky constant in the model for the sub-grid scale terms. It was found that, at the highest value of Reynolds number considered, the variation between the measured and predicted values of the global drag coefficient was under 10% - a result which is in line with the limitations inherent in both."
"TIAN, Lin",Release of endogenous dynorphin opioids in the prefrontal cortex disrupts cognition,"Following repeated opioid use, some dependent individuals experience persistent cognitive deficits that contribute to relapse of drug-taking behaviors, and one component of this response may be mediated by the endogenous dynorphin/kappa opioid system in neocortex. In C57BL/6 male mice, we find that acute morphine withdrawal evokes dynorphin release in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and disrupts cognitive function by activation of local kappa opioid receptors (KORs). Immunohistochemical analyses using a phospho-KOR antibody confirmed that both withdrawal-induced and optically evoked dynorphin release activated KOR in PFC. Using a genetically encoded sensor based on inert KOR (kLight1.2a), we revealed the in vivo dynamics of endogenous dynorphin release in the PFC. Local activation of KOR in PFC produced multi-phasic disruptions of memory processing in an operant-delayed alternation behavioral task, which manifest as reductions in response number and accuracy during early and late phases of an operant session. Local pretreatment in PFC with the selective KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine (norBNI) blocked the disruptive effect of systemic KOR activation during both early and late phases of the session. The early, but not late phase disruption was blocked by viral excision of PFC KORs, suggesting an anatomically dissociable contribution of pre- and postsynaptic KORs. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent mice or optical stimulation of pdynCre neurons using Channelrhodopsin-2 disrupted delayed alternation performance, and the dynorphin-induced effect was blocked by local norBNI. Our findings describe a mechanism for control of cortical function during opioid dependence and suggest that KOR antagonism could promote abstinence."

These inhibitors are commonly used to alter the cell surface glycosylation. However, structural analysis of the released glycans has been limited. In this research, the cell membranes were enriched and the glycans were released to obtain the N-glycans of the glycocalyx. Glycomic analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with a PGC chip column was used to profile the structures in the cell membrane. Glycans of untreated cells were compared to glycans of cells treated with inhibitors, including kifunensine, which inhibits the formation of complex- and hybrid-type structures, 2,4,7,8,9-Penta-O-acetyl-N-acetyl-3-fluoro-b-d-neuraminic acid methyl ester for sialylated glycans, 2-deoxy-2-fluorofucose, and 6-alkynyl fucose for fucosylated glycans. Kifunensine was the most effective, converting nearly 95% of glycans to high mannose types. The compound 6-alkynyl fucose inhibited some fucosylation but also incorporated into the glycan structure. Proteomic analysis of the enriched membrane for the four inhibitors showed only small changes in the proteome accompanied by large changes in the N-glycome for Caco-2. Future works may use these inhibitors to study the cellular behavior associated with the alteration of glycosylation in various biological systems, e.g., viral and bacterial infection, drug binding, and cell-cell interactions."

Each merging cluster provides only a single view of the cluster formation process, and the variety of merging clusters is vast. Clusters hosting double radio relics are rare and extremely important because they allow tight constraints on the merger scenario. We present a weak-lensing and X-ray analysis of MACS J1752.0+4440 (z = 0.365) and ZWCL 1856.8+6616 (z = 0.304), two double radio relic clusters. Our weak-lensing mass estimates show that each cluster is a major merger with approximately 1:1 mass ratio. The total mass of MACS J1752.0+4440 (ZWCL 1856.8+6616) is M200 = 14.7-+3.33.8 Â´ 1014 Me (M200 = 2.4-+0.70.9 Â´ 1014 Me). We find that these two clusters have comparable features in their weak-lensing and gas distributions, even though the systems have vastly different total masses. From the likeness of the X-ray morphologies and the remarkable symmetry of the radio relics, we propose that both systems underwent nearly head-on collisions. However, revelations from the hot-gas features and our multiwavelength data analysis suggest that ZWCL 1856.8+6618 is likely at a later merger phase than MACS J1752.0+4440. We postulate that the SW radio relic in MACS J1752.0 +4440 is a result of particle reacceleration."

A common industry practice is to cover an affected eye with a piece of cloth to reduce exposure to face flies and ultraviolet light with the goal of alleviating pain, accelerating healing, and reducing spread. To study the efficacy of eye patches in the treatment of IBK, a group of 216 clinically normal Angus crossbred steers were followed between April and August 2019 and evaluated weekly for the development of IBK. Eyes of cattle that developed IBK were enrolled with a blocked randomization scheme based on ulcer severity score to receive either an eye patch (treatment group) or no eye patch (control group). All treatment and control group animals received parenteral antimicrobial and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory treatments and were housed in a pasture separated from the rest of the cohort for a maximum of 28 d or until clinical cure. Corneal ulcer areas were measured, and body weights were recorded twice weekly for steers in the treatment and control groups. Weights of all steers in the cohort were recorded three times during the trial period. The primary outcome, rate of corneal ulcer healing, was higher (P = 0.001) for lesions in eyes receiving an eye patch as determined by a linear mixed model that controlled for ulcer severity score at enrollment and previous IBK in the opposite eye. Median corneal ulcer healing time was 10 (IQR [Interquartile range] 7-17) d for patched eyes vs. 14 (IQR 7-21) d for unpatched eyes. In a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for severity score at diagnosis, the hazard ratio for ulcer healing was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.02-2.56, P = 0.042) for eyes that received a patch compared to eyes that did not. Among all 216 steers in the cohort, those that were diagnosed with IBK had a numerically higher average daily gain (ADG) (0.45 [Â±SE 0.01] kg) vs. those that were not (0.42 [Â±SE 0.12] kg; P = 0.06). In enrolled steers that received a patch, the secondary outcome ADG was 0.47 (Â±SE 0.02) kg compared to 0.43 (Â±SE 0.02) kg in controls (P = 0.22). Weight gain may have been confounded by pasture during the treatment period. Results of this trial support the use of this low-cost intervention; further investigation into possible reasons for observed differences in weight gain may be warranted."
"HWANG, Sung Hee H",Eicosanoid regulation of debris-stimulated metastasis,"Cancer therapy reduces tumor burden via tumor cell death (""debris""), which can accelerate tumor progression via the failure of inflammation resolution. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop treatment modalities that stimulate the clearance or resolution of inflammation-associated debris. Here, we demonstrate that chemotherapy-generated debris stimulates metastasis by up-regulating soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and the prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 (EP4). Therapy-induced tumor cell debris triggers a storm of proinflammatory and proangiogenic eicosanoid-driven cytokines. Thus, targeting a single eicosanoid or cytokine is unlikely to prevent chemotherapy-induced metastasis. Pharmacological abrogation of both sEH and EP4 eicosanoid pathways prevents hepato-pancreatic tumor growth and liver metastasis by promoting macrophage phagocytosis of debris and counterregulating a protumorigenic eicosanoid and cytokine storm. Therefore, stimulating the clearance of tumor cell debris via combined sEH and EP4 inhibition is an approach to prevent debris-stimulated metastasis and tumor growth."

Matrix-bound vesicles (MBVs), a special class of vesicles localized in association with the extracellular matrix (ECM), have been identified as critical bioactive factors and shown to mediate significant regenerative functions of ECM scaffolds. Loading EVs onto bioscaffolds to mimic the MBV-ECM complex has been shown superior to EV bolus injection in recent in vivo studies, such as in providing enhanced tissue regeneration, EV retention rates, and healing efficacy. Different types of natural biomaterials, synthetic polymers, and ceramics have been developed for EV loading, and these EV functionalized biomaterials have been applied in different areas for disease treatment. The EV functionalized scaffolds can be designed to be biodegradable, off-the-shelf biomaterials as a delivery vehicle for EVs. Overall, the bioengineered EV-loaded bioscaffolds represent a promising approach for cell-free treatment in clinical applications."

"MOORE, Frances C",Estimates of country level temperature-related mortality damage functions.,"Many studies project that climate change is expected to cause a significant number of excess deaths. Yet, in integrated assessment models that determine the social cost of carbon (SCC), human mortality impacts do not reflect the latest scientific understanding. We address this issue by estimating country-level mortality damage functions for temperature-related mortality with global spatial coverage. We rely on projections from the most comprehensive published study in the epidemiology literature of future temperature impacts on mortality (Gasparrini et al. in Lancet Planet Health 1:e360-e367, 2017), which estimated changes in heat- and cold-related mortality for 23 countries over the twenty-first century. We model variation in these mortality projections as a function of baseline climate, future temperature change, and income variables and then project future changes in mortality for every country. We find significant spatial heterogeneity in projected mortality impacts, with hotter and poorer places more adversely affected than colder and richer places. In the absence of income-based adaptation, the global mortality rate in 2080-2099 is expected to increase by 1.8% [95% CI 0.8-2.8%] under a lower-emissions RCP 4.5 scenario and by 6.2% [95% CI 2.5-10.0%] in the very high-emissions RCP 8.5 scenario relative to 2001-2020. When the reduced sensitivity to heat associated with rising incomes, such as greater ability to invest in air conditioning, is accounted for, the expected end-of-century increase in the global mortality rate is 1.1% [95% CI 0.4-1.9%] in RCP 4.5 and 4.2% [95% CI 1.8-6.7%] in RCP 8.5. In addition, we compare recent estimates of climate-change induced excess mortality from diarrheal disease, malaria and dengue fever in 2030 and 2050 with current estimates used in SCC calculations and show these are likely underestimated in current SCC estimates, but are also small compared to more direct temperature effects."

The property was harnessed to develop a two-step chemoenzymatic strategy for facile synthesis of novel and divergent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-glycosides and derivatives in preparative scales. The discovery and the application of the new property of existing glycosyltransferases expand their catalytic capabilities in generating novel carbohydrate linkages, thus prompting the synthesis of diverse glycans and glycoconjugates for biological studies."

"FIEHN, Oliver","Indoxyl sulfate, a gut microbiome-derived uremic toxin, is associated with psychic anxiety and its functional magnetic resonance imaging-based neurologic signature","It is unknown whether indoles, metabolites of tryptophan that are derived entirely from bacterial metabolism in the gut, are associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Serum samples (baseline, 12&nbsp;weeks) were drawn from participants (nâ€‰=â€‰196) randomized to treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), escitalopram, or duloxetine for major depressive disorder. Baseline indoxyl sulfate abundance was positively correlated with severity of psychic anxiety and total anxiety and with resting state functional connectivity to a network that processes aversive stimuli (which includes the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC-FC), bilateral anterior insula, right anterior midcingulate cortex, and the right premotor areas). The relation between indoxyl sulfate and psychic anxiety was mediated only through the metabolite's effect on the SCC-FC with the premotor area. Baseline indole abundances were unrelated to post-treatment outcome measures, and changes in symptoms were not correlated with changes in indole concentrations. These results suggest that CBT and antidepressant medications relieve anxiety via mechanisms unrelated to modulation of indoles derived from gut microbiota; it remains possible that treatment-related improvement stems from their impact on other aspects of the gut microbiome. A peripheral gut microbiome-derived metabolite was associated with altered neural processing and with psychiatric symptom (anxiety) in humans, which provides further evidence that gut microbiome disruption can contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders that may require different therapeutic approaches. Given the exploratory nature of this study, findings should be replicated in confirmatory studies.Clinical trial NCT00360399 ""Predictors of Antidepressant Treatment Response: The Emory CIDAR"" https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00360399 ."

The AMD considered were ceftiofur, administered parenterally, and neomycin sulfate added in milk replacer and fed to calves during the first 20 days of life. Fifty-five calves, aged one to three days, were enrolled and followed to 64 days. Fecal samples were collected three times/week and treatments recorded daily. Enterobacteriaceae were quantified for a subset of 33 calves using spiral plating on plain, ceftiofur supplemented, and neomycin supplemented MacConkey agar. Negative binomial models were used to predict the association between treatment with AMD and the gain and loss of Enterobacteriaceae resistance over time. Acquisition of resistance by the Enterobacteriaceae occurred during treatment and peaked between days three to four post-treatment before decreasing to below treatment levels at days seven to eight post-treatment. Acquisition of neomycin resistance was observed on the first sampling day (day four from the start of feeding medicated milk replacer) to day eight, followed by cyclical peaks until day 29, when the Enterobacteriaceae counts decreased below pre-treatment. Enterobacteriaceae resistance against both AMD increased after AMD administration and didn't return to pre-therapeutic status until seven or more days after therapy had been discontinued. The study findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Enterobacteriaceae under routine AMD use in calves."

In social-personality psychology, as well as psychology more generally, there is little guidance for how to deal with sibling constructs, which can result in researchers ignoring or mishandling them. In this article, we start by situating sibling constructs in the literature on the jingle-jangle fallacies. Then, we outline 10 conceptual and empirical criteria for determining the degree to which, and in what ways, constructs may share a sibling relationship, using self-esteem and grandiose narcissism as a running example. Finally, we discuss strategies for handling sibling constructs in a systematic and transparent way. We hope that the procedures described here will help social-personality psychologists identify sibling constructs, understand when and why they pose problems for their research, and adopt strategies that ameliorate their adverse effects."

Results from studies in rodents and some clinical investigations suggest that meal time manipulation may be a potential lifestyle approach against conditions involving perturbations in glucose homeostasis (e.g., hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, diabetes, etc.). The purpose of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate the current literature on the role of meal timing and daily nutrient distribution on glycemic control during pregnancy. Only a small number of mostly observational studies have assessed the role of meal timing in glucose homeostasis during pregnancy. Food consumption earlier in the day and short-term fasting with adequate nutrient intake may improve glycemic control during the second and third trimester of gestation. Considering that the field of chrononutrition is still in its infancy and many questions remain unanswered, future prospective and carefully designed studies are needed to better understand the role of meal timing in metabolic homeostasis and maternal and fetal health outcomes during pregnancy."
"TAUFOUR, Valentin",Electronic structure and topology across Tc in the magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2,"Co3Sn2S2 is a magnetic Weyl semimetal, in which ferromagnetic ordering at 177K is predicted to stabilize Weyl points. We perform temperature and spatial dependent angle--resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements through the Curie temperature (Tc), which show large band shifts and renormalization concomitant with the onset of magnetism. We argue that Co3Sn2S2 evolves from a Mott ferromagnet below Tc to a correlated metallic state above Tc. To understand the magnetism, we derive a tight-binding model of Co-3dx2âˆ’y2 orbitals on the kagome lattice. At the filling obtained by first-principles calculations, this model reproduces the ferromagnetic ground state, and results in the reduction of Coulomb interactions due to cluster effects. Using a disordered local moment simulation, we show how this reduced Hubbard-U leads to a collapse of the bands across the magnetic transition, resulting in a correlated state which carries associated characteristic photoemission signatures that are distinct from those of a simple lifting of exchange splitting. The behavior of topology across Tc is discussed in the context of this description of the magnetism."

This study documents the frequency of news coverage of ERPOs throughout 2018 and examines the narratives used by media outlets to describe this risk-based firearm policy.MethodsUsing a mixed-method descriptive design, we examine the frequency of national&nbsp;news media coverage of ERPO legislation in 2018, before and after the Parkland shooting, and analyze the content of news articles related to a sample of states that considered ERPO legislation after the shooting.ResultsWe find a sharp increase in the frequency of articles related to ERPOs following the Parkland shooting and smaller increases in coverage&nbsp;surrounding ERPO policy proposals and other public mass shootings that year. Nearly three-quarters of articles in our content analysis mentioned the Parkland shooting. The news media often mentioned or quoted politicians compared to other stakeholders, infrequently specified uses for ERPOs (e.g., prevention of mass violence, suicide, or other violence), and rarely included evidence on effectiveness of such policies. More than one-quarter of articles mentioned a mass shooting perpetrator by name, and one-third of articles used the term ""gun control.""ConclusionsThis study describes the emerging public discourse, as informed by media messaging and framing, on ERPOs as states continue to debate and implement these risk-based firearm violence prevention policies."
"KEEGAN, Theresa H",Evaluating the impact of social and built environments on health related-quality of life among cancer survivors,"BackgroundWith almost 17 million U.S. cancer survivors, understanding multilevel factors impacting health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is critical to improving survivorship outcomes. Few studies have evaluated neighborhood impact on HRQOL among cancer survivors.MethodsWe combined sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral data from three registry-based studies in California. Using a three-level mixed linear regression model (participants nested within block groups and study/regions), we examined associations of both independent neighborhood attributes and neighborhood archetypes, which capture interactions inherent among neighborhood attributes, with two HRQOL outcomes, physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) composite scores.ResultsFor the 2,477 survivors, 46% were 70+ years, 52% were non-Hispanic White, and 53% had localized disease. In models minimally adjusted for age, stage, and cancer recurrence, HRQOL was associated with neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), racial/ethnic composition, population density, street connectivity, restaurant environment index, traffic density, urbanicity, crowding, rental properties, and non-single family units. In fully adjusted models, higher nSES remained associated with better PCS, and restaurant environment index, specifically more unhealthy restaurants, associated with worse MCS. In multivariable-adjusted models of neighborhood archetype, compared with upper middle-class suburb, Hispanic small town and inner city had lower PCS, and high status had higher MCS.ConclusionsAmong survivors, higher nSES was associated with better HRQOL; more unhealthy restaurants were associated with worse HQROL. As some neighborhood archetypes were associated with HRQOL, they provide an approach to capture how neighborhood attributes interact to impact HRQOL.ImpactElucidating the pathways through which neighborhood attributes influence HRQOL is important in improving survivorship outcomes."

"LUCK, Steven J",Rapid Extraction of the Spatial Distribution of Physical Saliency and Semantic Informativeness from Natural Scenes in the Human Brain.,"Physically salient objects are thought to attract attention in natural scenes. However, research has shown that meaning maps, which capture the spatial distribution of semantically informative scene features, trump physical saliency in predicting the pattern of eye moments in natural scene viewing. Meaning maps even predict the fastest eye movements, suggesting that the brain extracts the spatial distribution of potentially meaningful scene regions very rapidly. To test this hypothesis, we applied representational similarity analysis to ERP data. The ERPs were obtained from human participants (N = 32, male and female) who viewed a series of 50 different natural scenes while performing a modified 1-back task. For each scene, we obtained a physical saliency map from a computational model and a meaning map from crowd-sourced ratings. We then used representational similarity analysis to assess the extent to which the representational geometry of physical saliency maps and meaning maps can predict the representational geometry of the neural response (the ERP scalp distribution) at each moment in time following scene onset. We found that a link between physical saliency and the ERPs emerged first (âˆ¼78 ms after stimulus onset), with a link to semantic informativeness emerging soon afterward (âˆ¼87 ms after stimulus onset). These findings are in line with previous evidence indicating that saliency is computed rapidly, while also indicating that information related to the spatial distribution of semantically informative scene elements is computed shortly thereafter, early enough to potentially exert an influence on eye movements.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Attention may be attracted by physically salient objects, such as flashing lights, but humans must also be able to direct their attention to meaningful parts of scenes. Understanding how we direct attention to meaningful scene regions will be important for developing treatments for disorders of attention and for designing roadways, cockpits, and computer user interfaces. Information about saliency appears to be extracted rapidly by the brain, but little is known about the mechanisms that determine the locations of meaningful information. To address this gap, we showed people photographs of real-world scenes and measured brain activity. We found that information related to the locations of meaningful scene elements was extracted rapidly, shortly after the emergence of saliency-related information."

We studied children with congenital upper limb differences, as they are vulnerable to disability. This case study documents a collaborative effort between American and Nicaraguan orthopedic surgeons to determine unmet health needs of children with congenital upper limb differences at Hospital Manuel de Jesus Rivera (""La Mascota"" Hospital) in Nicaragua, with the goal of developing programs that successfully address these needs within the context of the priorities of the community. Participants were recruited during one of the biannual pediatric hand specialty clinics held by a partnership of pediatric hand surgeons and occupational therapists under the auspices of Health Volunteers Overseas (La Brigada de las Manos, or ""La Brigada"") and Nicaraguan orthopedic surgeons. Structured interviews were performed with 34 parents or caregivers of patients with the diagnosis of a congenital upper limb difference. Parents were asked to rank the social, economic, environmental, and biological factors that determine health according to priority. Using the Hanlon Method for prioritizing health problems, in consultation with local providers and the program director of La Brigada, five needs were identified: (1) improvements in access to specialized care from hand surgeons and (2) rehabilitation specialists; (3) improvements in upper extremity function; (4) access to transportation; and (5) improvement in physical activity and sports participation. Based on the results of this needs assessment, we learned that some of the needs were already part of the ongoing work of the partnership, but in addition, more needs became evident; for that reason, local health care providers and members of La Brigada identified potential solutions to these needs and are currently working to translate these in future interventions."

"WANG, Guobao",Total-Body PET Multiparametric Imaging of Cancer Using a Voxelwise Strategy of Compartmental Modeling,"Quantitative dynamic PET with compartmental modeling has the potential to enable multiparametric imaging and more accurate quantification than static PET imaging. Conventional methods for parametric imaging commonly use a single kinetic model for all image voxels and neglect the heterogeneity of physiologic models, which can work well for single-organ parametric imaging but may significantly compromise total-body parametric imaging on a scanner with a long axial field of view. In this paper, we evaluate the necessity of voxelwise compartmental modeling strategies, including time delay correction (TDC) and model selection, for total-body multiparametric imaging. Methods: Ten subjects (5 patients with metastatic cancer and 5 healthy volunteers) were scanned on a total-body PET/CT system after injection of 370 MBq of 18F-FDG. Dynamic data were acquired for 60 min. Total-body parametric imaging was performed using 2 approaches. One was the conventional method that uses a single irreversible 2-tissue-compartment model with and without TDC. The second approach selects the best kinetic model from 3 candidate models for individual voxels. The differences between the 2 approaches were evaluated for parametric imaging of microkinetic parameters and the 18F-FDG net influx rate, KiResults: TDC had a nonnegligible effect on kinetic quantification of various organs and lesions. The effect was larger in lesions with a higher blood volume. Parametric imaging of Ki with the standard 2-tissue-compartment model introduced vascular-region artifacts, which were overcome by the voxelwise model selection strategy. Conclusion: The time delay and appropriate kinetic model vary in different organs and lesions. Modeling of the time delay of the blood input function and model selection improved total-body multiparametric imaging."
"HUSSAIN, Shehnaz K",Duodenal Microbiome and Serum Metabolites Predict Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a Multicenter Cohort of Patients with Cirrhosis,"BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rapidly increasing in the U.S. and is a leading cause of mortality for patients with cirrhosis. Discovering novel biomarkers for risk stratification of HCC is paramount. We examined biomarkers of the gut-liver axis in a prospective multicenter cohort.MethodsPatients with cirrhosis without a history of HCC were recruited between May 2015 and March 2020 and prospectively followed at 3 tertiary care hospitals in Los Angeles. Microbiome analysis was performed on duodenal biopsies and metabolomic analysis was performed on serum samples, collected at the time of enrollment. Optimal microbiome-based survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were used to determine microbiota and metabolite associations with HCC development, respectively.ResultsA total of 227 participants with liver cirrhosis contributed a total of 459.58 person-years of follow-up, with 14 incident HCC diagnoses. Male sex (HRâ€‰=â€‰7.06, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.02-54.86) and baseline hepatic encephalopathy (HE, HRâ€‰=â€‰4.65, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.60-13.52) were associated with developing HCC over follow-up. Adjusting for age, sex, baseline HE, and alkaline phosphatase, an increased risk of HCC were observed for participants with the highest versus lowest three quartiles for duodenal Alloprevotella (HRâ€‰=â€‰3.22, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.06-9.73) and serum taurocholic acid (HRâ€‰=â€‰6.87, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰2.32-20.27), methionine (HRâ€‰=â€‰9.97, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰3.02-32.94), and methioninesulfoxide (HRâ€‰=â€‰5.60, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.84-17.10). Being in the highest quartile for Alloprevotella or methionine had a sensitivity and specificity for developing HCC of 85.71% and 60.56%, respectively, with an odds ratio of 10.92 (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰2.23-53.48).ConclusionAlloprevotella and methionine, methioninesulfoxide, and taurocholic acid predicted future HCC development in a high-risk population of participants with liver cirrhosis."
"HAMMOCK, Bruce","New Alkoxy- Analogues of Epoxyeicosatrienoic Acids Attenuate Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity In Vitro via Reduction of Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Oxidative Stress, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling, and Caspase Activation","The usage of cisplatin, a highly potent chemotherapeutic, is limited by its severe nephrotoxicity. Arachidonic acid (ARA)-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors were shown to ameliorate this dose-limiting side effect, but both approaches have some pharmacological limitations. Analogues of EETs are an alternative avenue with unique benefits, but the current series of analogues face concerns regarding their structure and mimetic functionality. Hence, in this study, regioisomeric mixtures of four new ARA alkyl ethers were synthesized, characterized, and assessed as EET analogues against the concentration- and time-dependent toxicities of cisplatin in porcine proximal tubular epithelial cells. All four ether groups displayed bioisostere activity, ranging from marginal for methoxy- (1), good for n-propoxy- (4), and excellent for ethoxy- (2) and i-propoxy- (3). Compounds 2 and 3 displayed cytoprotective effects comparable to that of an EET regioisomeric mixture (5) against high, acute cisplatin exposures but were more potent against low to moderate, chronic exposures. Compounds 2 and 3 (and 5) acted through stabilization of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and attenuation of reactive oxygen species, leading to reduced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and JNK and decreased activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. This study demonstrates that alkoxy- groups are potent and more metabolically stable bioisostere alternatives to the epoxide within EETs that enable sEH-independent activity. It also illustrates the potential of ether-based mimics of EETs and other epoxy fatty acids as promising nephroprotective agents to tackle the clinically relevant side effect of cisplatin without compromising its antineoplastic function."
"BENNETT, Deborah","Variability of Urinary Concentrations of Phenols, Parabens, and Triclocarban during Pregnancy in First Morning Voids and Pooled Samples","Urinary concentrations of phenols, parabens, and triclocarban have been extensively used as biomarkers of exposure. However, because these compounds are quickly metabolized and excreted in urine, characterizing participants' long-term average exposure from a few spot samples is challenging. To examine the variability of urinary concentrations of these compounds during pregnancy, we quantified four phenols, four parabens, and triclocarban in 357 first morning voids (FMVs) and 203 pooled samples collected during the second and third trimesters of 173 pregnancies. We computed intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) by the sample type (FMV and pool) across two trimesters and by the number of composite samples in pools, ranging from 2 to 4, within the same trimester. Among the three compounds detected in more than 50% of the samples, the ICCs across two trimesters were higher in pools (0.29-0.68) than in FMVs (0.17-0.52) and the highest ICC within the same trimester was observed when pooling either two or three composites. Methyl paraben and propyl paraben primarily exposed via cosmetic use had approximately 2-3 times higher ICCs than bisphenol A primarily exposed via diet. Our findings support that within-subject pooling of biospecimens can increase the reproducibility of pregnant women's exposure to these compounds and thus could potentially minimize exposure misclassification."
"BLANCO-ULATE, Barbara",Genomic prediction of strawberry resistance to postharvest fruit decay caused by the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea,"Gray mold, a disease of strawberry (Fragaria Ã— ananassa) caused by the ubiquitous necrotroph Botrytis cinerea, renders fruit unmarketable and causes economic losses in the postharvest supply chain. To explore the feasibility of selecting for increased resistance to gray mold, we undertook genetic and genomic prediction studies in strawberry populations segregating for fruit quality and shelf life traits hypothesized to pleiotropically affect susceptibility. As predicted, resistance to gray mold was heritable but quantitative and genetically complex. While every individual was susceptible, the speed of symptom progression and severity differed. Narrow-sense heritability ranged from 0.38 to 0.71 for lesion diameter (LD) and 0.39 to 0.44 for speed of emergence of external mycelium (EM). Even though significant additive genetic variation was observed for LD and EM, the phenotypic ranges were comparatively narrow and genome-wide analyses did not identify any large-effect loci. Genomic selection (GS) accuracy ranged from 0.28 to 0.59 for LD and 0.37 to 0.47 for EM. Additive genetic correlations between fruit quality and gray mold resistance traits were consistent with prevailing hypotheses: LD decreased as titratable acidity increased, whereas EM increased as soluble solid content decreased and firmness increased. We concluded that phenotypic and GS could be effective for reducing LD and increasing EM, especially in long shelf life populations, but that a significant fraction of the genetic variation for resistance to gray mold was caused by the pleiotropic effects of fruit quality traits that differ among market and shelf life classes."

"HUNG, Tien-Chieh",Experimental validation of otolith-based age and growth reconstructions across multiple life stages of a critically endangered estuarine fish,"BackgroundThe application of otolith-based tools to inform the management and conservation of fishes first requires taxon- and stage-specific validation. The Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), a critically endangered estuarine fish that is endemic to the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE), California, United States, serves as a key indicator species in the SFE; thus, understanding this species' vital rates and population dynamics is valuable for assessing the overall health of the estuary. Otolith-based tools have been developed and applied across multiple life stages of Delta Smelt to reconstruct age structure, growth, phenology, and migration. However, key methodological assumptions have yet to be validated, thus limiting confidence in otolith-derived metrics that are important for informing major water management decisions in the SFE.MethodsUsing known-age cultured Delta Smelt and multiple independent otolith analysts, we examined otolith formation, otolith-somatic proportionality, aging accuracy and precision, left-right symmetry, and the effects of image magnification for larval, juvenile, and adult Delta Smelt.ResultsOverall, otolith size varied linearly with fish size (from 10-60 mm), explaining 99% of the variation in fish length, despite a unique slope for larvae < 10 mm. Otolith-somatic proportionality was similar among wild and cultured specimens. Aging precision among independent analysts was 98% and aging accuracy relative to known ages was 96%, with age estimates exhibiting negligible differences among left and right otoliths. Though error generally increased with age, percent error decreased from 0-30 days-post-hatch, with precision remaining relatively high (â‰¥ 95%) thereafter. Increased magnification (400Ã—) further improved aging accuracy for the oldest, slowest-growing individuals. Together, these results indicate that otolith-based techniques provide reliable age and growth reconstructions for larval, juvenile, and adult Delta Smelt. Such experimental assessments across multiple developmental stages are key steps toward assessing confidence in otolith-derived metrics that are often used to assess the dynamics of wild fish populations."

Recent progress has been made in developing targeted asthma therapeutics, especially for subjects with eosinophilic asthma. However, there is an unmet need for new approaches to treat patients with severe and exacerbation-prone asthma, who contribute disproportionately to disease burden. Extensive deep phenotyping has revealed the heterogeneous nature of severe asthma and identified distinct disease subtypes. A&nbsp;current challenge in the field is to translate new and emerging knowledge about different pathobiologic mechanisms in asthma into patient-specific therapies, with the ultimate goal of modifying the natural history of disease. Here, we describe the Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network, a groundbreaking collaborative effort of asthma researchers and biostatisticians from around the United States. The PrecISE Network was designed to conduct phase II/proof-of-concept clinical trials of precision interventions in the population with severe asthma, and is supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. Using an innovative adaptive platform trial design, the PrecISE Network will evaluate up to 6 interventions simultaneously in biomarker-defined subgroups of subjects. We review the development and organizational structure of the PrecISE Network, and choice of interventions being studied. We hope that the PrecISE Network will enhance our understanding of asthma subtypes and accelerate the development of therapeutics for severe asthma."

"MEIER, Alan K",Smart Homes as Enablers for Depression Pre-Diagnosis Using PHQ-9 on HMI through Fuzzy Logic Decision System,"Depression is a common mental illness characterized by sadness, lack of interest, or pleasure. According to the DSM-5, there are nine symptoms, from which an individual must present 4 or 5 in the last two weeks to fulfill the diagnosis criteria of depression. Nevertheless, the common methods that health care professionals use to assess and monitor depression symptoms are face-to-face questionnaires leading to time-consuming or expensive methods. On the other hand, smart homes can monitor householders' health through smart devices such as smartphones, wearables, cameras, or voice assistants connected to the home. Although the depression disorders at smart homes are commonly oriented to the senior sector, depression affects all of us. Therefore, even though an expert needs to diagnose the depression disorder, questionnaires as the PHQ-9 help spot any depressive symptomatology as a pre-diagnosis. Thus, this paper proposes a three-step framework; the first step assesses the nine questions to the end-user through ALEXA or a gamified HMI. Then, a fuzzy logic decision system considers three actions based on the nine responses. Finally, the last step considers these three actions: continue monitoring through Alexa and the HMI, suggest specialist referral, and mandatory specialist referral."
"NORD, Alexander S",Autism risk gene POGZ promotes chromatin accessibility and expression of clustered synaptic genes,"Deleterious genetic variants in POGZ, which encodes the chromatin regulator Pogo Transposable Element with ZNF Domain protein, are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although it is a high-confidence ASD risk gene, the neurodevelopmental functions of POGZ remain unclear. Here we reveal the genomic binding of POGZ in the developing forebrain at euchromatic loci and gene regulatory elements (REs). We profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in Pogz-/- mice and show that POGZ promotes the active chromatin state and transcription of clustered synaptic genes. We further demonstrate that POGZ forms a nuclear complex and co-occupies loci with ADNP, another high-confidence ASD risk gene, and provide evidence that POGZ regulates other neurodevelopmental disorder risk genes as well. Our results reveal a neurodevelopmental function of an ASD risk gene and identify molecular targets that may elucidate its function in ASD."

"STEINBERG, Francene M",Dietary Management of Heart Failure: DASH Diet and Precision Nutrition Perspectives,"Heart failure (HF) is a major health care burden increasing in prevalence over time. Effective, evidence-based interventions for HF prevention and management are needed to improve patient longevity, symptom control, and quality of life. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet interventions can have a positive impact for HF patients. However, the absence of a consensus for comprehensive dietary guidelines and for pragmatic evidence limits the ability of health care providers to implement clinical recommendations. The refinement of medical nutrition therapy through precision nutrition approaches has the potential to reduce the burden of HF, improve clinical care, and meet the needs of diverse patients. The aim of this review is to summarize current evidence related to HF dietary recommendations including DASH diet nutritional interventions and to develop initial recommendations for DASH diet implementation in outpatient HF management. Articles involving human studies were obtained using the following search terms: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH diet), diet pattern, diet, metabolism, and heart failure. Only full-text articles written in English were included in this review. As DASH nutritional interventions have been proposed, limitations of these studies are the small sample size and non-randomization of interventions, leading to less reliable evidence. Randomized controlled interventions are needed to offer definitive evidence related to the use of the DASH diet in HF management."

In both cases a power-lawdistribution of smaller events were observed. In both cases theWeibull fit to the distribution of interval timeswas quite good with similar values of the power-lawexponent.We have also drawn an analogy between an earthquake rupture and a first-order phase change (nucleation). We consider this analogy both with and without damage. With damage the rupture is equivalent to an equilibrium phase change, without damage the rupture is equivalent to a spinodal phase change.We argue that the absence of a systematic precursory acceleration of seismicity prior to earthquakes is evidence that precursory damage does nor occur. Thus fault rupture can be associated with a spinodal phase change."
"DECARLI, Charles",Accelerated functional brain aging in pre-clinical familial Alzheimerâ€™s disease,"Resting state functional connectivity (rs-fMRI) is impaired early in persons who subsequently develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. This impairment may be leveraged to aid investigation of the pre-clinical phase of AD. We developed a model that predicts brain age from resting state (rs)-fMRI data, and assessed whether genetic determinants of AD, as well as beta-amyloid (AÎ²) pathology, can accelerate brain aging. Using data from 1340 cognitively unimpaired participants between 18-94 years of age from multiple sites, we showed that topological properties of graphs constructed from rs-fMRI can predict chronological age across the lifespan. Application of our predictive model to the context of pre-clinical AD revealed that the pre-symptomatic phase of autosomal dominant AD includes acceleration of functional brain aging. This association was stronger in individuals having significant AÎ² pathology."
"RADULASKI, Marina",Effect of Emitters on Quantum State Transfer in Coupled Cavity Arrays,"Over the last decade, conditions for perfect state transfer in quantum spin
chains have been discovered, and their experimental realizations addressed. In
this paper, we consider an extension of such studies to quantum state transfer
in a coupled cavity array including the effects of atoms in the cavities which
can absorb and emit photons as they propagate down the array. Our model is
equivalent to previously examined spin chains in the one-excitation sector and
in the absence of emitters. We introduce a Monte Carlo approach to the inverse
eigenvalue problem which allows the determination of the inter-cavity and
cavity-emitter couplings resulting in near-perfect quantum state transfer
fidelity, and examine the time dependent polariton wave function through exact
diagonalization of the resulting Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard Hamiltonian. The effect
of inhomogeneous emitter locations is also evaluated."
"BUTANI, Lavjay",Uncovering a Long-term Graft Survival Advantage Afforded by Infant Renal Transplantsâ€”An Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Database Analysis,"BackgroundRenal transplants (Tx) are performed infrequently in infants, due to concerns related to poor outcomes. The aim of our study was to compare graft failure rates in infant (<1 y) renal Tx recipients compared with older children.MethodsRetrospective cohort study of pediatric renal Tx recipients from 2000 to 2015, using the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network database. A log-linear event history regression model for time to graft failure, adjusting for age group and important confounders, was used to estimate post-Tx graft failure probabilities.ResultsIn 2696 Tx followed for a median of 6.1 y, 704 failures were observed. Significant predictors of graft failure were year of Tx (for each year after 2000, rates were 8.6% lower), Black race-ethnicity (63% higher compared with Whites), and number of HLA matches. For infants (nâ€‰=â€‰27), estimated graft failure percentage (95% confidence interval) within the first 1-, 2-, and 5-y post-Tx were 10.4 (0.1-21.1), 11.9 (1.2-22.6), and 16.4 (4.9-27.9). For the 1- to 11-y-olds (nâ€‰=â€‰1429), these were 3.8 (3.0-4.6), 6.3 (5.4-7.3), and 13.6 (12.2-15.0), respectively, and for the 12+ y olds (nâ€‰=â€‰1240), they were 3.8 (3.1-4.5), 8.1 (7.2-9.0), and 19.9 (18.1-21.7), respectively (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 for 5-y graft failure rate across age groups).ConclusionsInfant renal Tx recipients experience a higher graft failure rate in the first year, compared with older cohorts, but over longer intervals, cumulative failure rates are comparable or even lower. To minimize early graft losses such Tx should be performed in experienced centers."
"HASTINGS, Paul D",Weâ€™re all in this together: Focus on community attenuates effects of pandemic-related financial hardship on reactance to COVID-19 public health regulations,"There has been resistance to COVID-19 public health restrictions partly due to changes and reductions in work, resulting in financial stress. Psychological reactance theory posits that such restrictions to personal freedoms result in anger, defiance, and motivation to restore freedom. In an online study (N = 301), we manipulated the target of COVID-19 restrictions as impacting self or community. We hypothesized that (a) greater pandemic-related financial stress would predict greater reactance, (b) the self-focused restriction condition would elicit greater reactance than the community-focused restriction condition, (c) reactance would be greatest for financially-stressed individuals in the self-focused condition, and (d) greater reactance would predict lower adherence to social distancing guidelines. Independent of political orientation and sense of community, greater financial stress predicted greater reactance only in the self-focused condition; the community-focused condition attenuated this association. Additionally, greater reactance was associated with lower social distancing behavior. These findings suggest that economic hardship exacerbates negative responses to continued personal freedom loss. Community-focused COVID-19 health messaging may be better received during continued pandemic conditions."

Here we use a Gaussian mixture model to develop a parsimonious relationship between SIF from TROPOMI and GPP from flux towers across the conterminous United States (CONUS). The mixture model indicates the SIF-GPP relationship can be characterized by a linear model with two terms. We then estimate GPP across CONUS at 500Äâ‚¬Â¯m spatial resolution over a 16Äâ‚¬Â¯d moving window. We observe four extreme precipitation events that induce regional GPP anomalies: drought in western Texas, flooding in the midwestern US, drought in South Dakota, and drought in California. Taken together, these events account for 28Äâ‚¬Â¯% of the year-to-year GPP differences across CONUS. Despite these large regional anomalies, we find that CONUS GPP varies by less than 4Äâ‚¬Â¯% between 2018 and 2019."

"YANG, Jun",A Fast and Selective Approach for Profiling Vicinal Diols Using Liquid Chromatography-Post Column Derivatization-Double Precursor Ion Scanning Mass Spectrometry,"Vicinal diols are important signaling metabolites of various inflammatory diseases, and some of them are potential biomarkers for some diseases. Utilizing the rapid reaction between diol and 6-bromo-3-pyridinylboronic acid (BPBA), a selective and sensitive approach was established to profile these vicinal diols using liquid chromatography-post column derivatization coupled with double precursor ion scan-mass spectrometry (LC-PCD-DPIS-MS). After derivatization, all BPBA-vicinal-diol esters gave a pair of characteristic isotope ions resulting from 79Br and 81Br. The unique isotope pattern generated two characteristic fragment ions of m/z 200 and 202. Compared to a traditional offline derivatization technique, the new LC-PCD-DPIS-MS method retained the capacity of LC separation. In addition, it is more sensitive and selective than a full scan MS method. As an application, an in vitro study of the metabolism of epoxy fatty acids by human soluble epoxide hydrolase was tested. These vicinal-diol metabolites of individual regioisomers from different types of polyunsaturated fatty acids were easily identified. The limit of detection (LOD) reached as low as 25 nM. The newly developed LC-PCD-DPIS-MS method shows significant advantages in improving the selectivity and therefore can be employed as a powerful tool for profiling vicinal-diol compounds from biological matrices."

As a result of high-throughput sequencing methods, biologists currently live in a protein sequence-rich world. However, our knowledge of protein structure based on experimental data remains comparatively limited. As a consequence, protein structure prediction has established itself as a very active field of research to fill in this gap. This field, once thought to be reserved for theoretical biophysicists, is constantly reinventing itself, borrowing ideas informed by an ever-increasing assembly of scientific domains, from biology, chemistry, (statistical) physics, mathematics, computer science, statistics, bioinformatics, and more recently data sciences. We review the recent progress arising from this integration of knowledge, from the development of specific computer architecture to allow for longer timescales in physics-based simulations of protein folding to the recent advances in predicting contacts in proteins based on detection of coevolution using very large data sets of aligned protein sequences."
"KHANDAY, Imtiyaz A",Seed germination and vigor: ensuring crop sustainability in a changing climate,"In the coming decades, maintaining a steady food supply for the increasing world population will require high-yielding crop plants which can be productive under increasingly variable conditions. Maintaining high yields will require the successful and uniform establishment of plants in the field under altered environmental conditions. Seed vigor, a complex agronomic trait that includes seed longevity, germination speed, seedling growth, and early stress tolerance, determines the duration and success of this establishment period. Elevated temperature during early seed development can decrease seed size, number, and fertility, delay germination and reduce seed vigor in crops such as cereals, legumes, and vegetable crops. Heat stress in mature seeds can reduce seed vigor in crops such as lettuce, oat, and chickpea. Warming trends and increasing temperature variability can increase seed dormancy and reduce germination rates, especially in crops that require lower temperatures for germination and seedling establishment. To improve seed germination speed and success, much research has focused on selecting quality seeds for replanting, priming seeds before sowing, and breeding varieties with improved seed performance. Recent strides in understanding the genetic basis of variation in seed vigor have used genomics and transcriptomics to identify candidate genes for improving germination, and several studies have explored the potential impact of climate change on the percentage and timing of germination. In this review, we discuss these recent advances in the genetic underpinnings of seed performance as well as how climate change is expected to affect vigor in current varieties of staple, vegetable, and other crops."

"HOU, Melody Y",Complex family planning and pediatric hematology oncology integrated clinic for young people with blood disorders and heavy or abnormal menstrual bleeding,"ObjectivesTo describe practice patterns of an integrated complex family planning-pediatric hematology oncology clinic for patients with blood disorders STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of patients who had an initial consultation for blood disorders impacting menstrual bleeding in an integrated complex family planning-pediatric hematology oncology clinic from October 2015 to September 2020. We reviewed all charts to extract medical and gynecologic history, blood disorder diagnosis, hormonal treatment prior to and following initial consultation, subsequent visits to the integrated clinic, and hormonal treatment up to 24 months after initial consultation.ResultsWe saw 47 patients; their most common blood disorder diagnosis was protein defect (14 of 47, 30%). Most patients (30 of 47, 64%) were not using any hormonal treatment prior to their initial consultation. After the initial consultation, 26 (55%) elected to start, change, or discontinue hormonal treatment for abnormal menstrual bleeding, the most common treatment being combined hormonal contraception (CHC, 22 of 47, 47%), alone or as dual therapy. Over the study duration, 36 patients (77%) initiated, changed, or discontinued their hormone treatment, 22 (61%) of whom changed their treatment plan more than once. CHC usage decreased from 19 of 47 (40%) to 8 of 37 (22%) and hormonal device usage, particularly the implant, increased from 9 of 47 (19%) to 11 of 37 (30%) over the 24 months from initial consultation.ConclusionMost patients in an integrated complex family planning-pediatric hematology oncology clinic will change their menstrual bleeding hormone treatment with initial consultation, although management may require multiple changes. The most common treatment 24 months following the initial consultation was hormonal devices.ImplicationsPatients with blood disorders affecting menstrual bleeding have complex needs that could be addressed by an integrated complex family planning-pediatric hematology oncology clinic. Most patients require multiple changes in treatment to achieve adequate control of their bleeding, and patients were more likely to choose hormonal devices for management over time."

However, there has been a divide where specialized solutions were often deployed to support either OLTP or OLAP workloads but not both; thus, limiting the analysis to stale and possibly irrelevant data. In this paper, we present Lineage-based Data Store (L-Store) that combines the realtime processing of transactional and analytical workloads within a single unified engine by introducing a novel update-friendly lineage-based storage architecture. By exploiting the lineage, we develop a contention-free and lazy staging of columnar data from a write-optimized form (suitable for OLTP) into a read-optimized form (suitable for OLAP) in a transactionally consistent approach that supports querying and retaining the current and historic data."

"HAMMOCK, Bruce",Sex-Specific Differences in Resolution of Airway Inflammation in Fat-1 Transgenic Mice Following Repetitive Agricultural Dust Exposure,"In agriculture industries, workers are at increased risk for developing pulmonary diseases due to inhalation of agricultural dusts, particularly when working in enclosed confinement facilities. Agricultural dusts inhalation leads to unresolved airway inflammation that precedes the development and progression of lung disease. We have previously shown beneficial effects of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (Ï‰-3 PUFA) DHA in protecting against the negative inflammatory effects of repetitive dust exposure in the lung. Dietary manipulation of pulmonary disease risk is an attractive and timely approach given the contribution of an increased Ï‰-6 to Ï‰-3 PUFA ratio to low grade inflammation and chronic disease in the Western diet. To prevent any confounding factors that comes with dietary supplementation of Ï‰-3 PUFA (different sources, purity, dose, and duration), we employed a Fat-1 transgenic mouse model that convert Ï‰-6 PUFA to Ï‰-3 PUFA, leading to a tissue Ï‰-6 to Ï‰-3 PUFA ratio of approximately 1:1. Building on our initial findings, we hypothesized that attaining elevated tissue levels of Ï‰-3 PUFA would attenuate agricultural dust-induced lung inflammation and its resolution. To test this hypothesis, we compared wild-type (WT) and Fat-1 transgenic mice in their response to aqueous extracts of agricultural dust (DE). We also used a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor (sEH) to potentiate the effects of Ï‰-3 PUFA, since sEH inhibitors have been shown to stabilize the anti-inflammatory P450 metabolites derived from both Ï‰-3 and Ï‰-6 PUFA and promote generation of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators from Ï‰-3 PUFA. Over a three-week period, mice were exposed to a total of 15 intranasal instillations of DE obtained from swine confinement buildings in the Midwest. We observed genotype and sex-specific differences between the WT vs. Fat-1 transgenic mice in response to repetitive dust exposure, where three-way ANOVA revealed significant main effects of treatment, genotype, and sex. Also, Fat-1 transgenic mice displayed reduced lymphoid aggregates in the lung following DE exposure as compared to WT animals exposed to DE, suggesting improved resilience to the DE-induced inflammatory effects. Overall, our data implicate a protective role of Ï‰-3 FA in the lung following repetitive dust exposure."
"ABOUYARED, Marianne",Bereavement Practices Among Head and Neck Cancer Surgeons,"ObjectivesHead and neck cancer surgeons frequently interact with dying patients with advanced disease and their families, but little is known about their bereavement practices after a patient's death. The aim of this study is to elucidate the frequency of common bereavement practices, cited barriers to bereavement, and predictive physician factors that lead to an increase in bereavement practices among head and neck cancer surgeons.MethodsA 20-item survey was sent to 827 active surgeons of the American Head and Neck Society. Approval was obtained and the survey was distributed through the American Head and Neck Society. Demographics, frequency of common bereavement practices, empathy, and barriers were assessed. Multiple linear regression was performed to determine physician factors associated with more frequent bereavement follow-up.ResultsThere were 156 respondents (18.9% response rate). Overall, surgeons were more likely to usually/always call (48.5%) or send a letter (42.4%) compared with other practices such as attending funerals (0%), offering family meetings (18.6%), or referring family members to counseling (7.7%). Many barriers were cited as being at least somewhat important: being unaware about a patient's death (67.3%) was the most cited, whereas 51.3% cited a lack of mentorship/training in this area. Scoring higher on empathy questions (P&nbsp;â‰¤â€‰.001) was associated with more frequent surgeon bereavement follow-up with the family of deceased patients.ConclusionThere is substantial practice variation among surgeons suggesting a lack of consensus on their roles in bereavement follow-up. Having higher empathy was predictive of higher engagement.Level of evidenceNA Laryngoscope, 132:1971-1975, 2022."
"KURZROCK, Eric","Combination product of dermal matrix, preconditioned human mesenchymal stem cells and timolol promotes wound healing in the porcine wound model.","A combination product of human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) embedded in an extracellular matrix scaffold and preconditioned with hypoxia and the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, timolol, combined with sustained timolol application post implantation, has shown promising results for improving wound healing in a diabetic mouse model. In the present study, we extend those findings to the more translatable large animal porcine wound model and show that the combined treatment promotes wound reepithelialization in these excisional wounds by 40.2% and increases the CD31 immunostaining marker of angiogenesis compared with the matrix control, while maintaining an accumulated timolol plasma concentration below the clinically safe level of 0.3&nbsp;ng/mL after the 15-day course of topical application. Human GAPDH was not elevated in the day 15 wounds treated with MSC-containing device relative to wounds treated with matrix alone, indicating that the xenografted human MSCs in the treatment do not persist in these immune-competent animals after 15â€‰days. The work demonstrates the efficacy and safety of the combined treatment for improving healing in the clinically relevant porcine wound model."
"JIN, Lee-Way",First in patient assessment of brain tumor infiltrative margins using simultaneous time-resolved measurements of 5-ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence and tissue autofluorescence,"Significance5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence is currently used for image-guided glioma resection. Typically, this widefield imaging method highlights the bulk of high-grade gliomas, but it underperforms at the infiltrating edge where PpIX fluorescence is not visible to the eyes. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) has the potential to detect PpIX fluorescence below the visible detection threshold. Moreover, simultaneous acquisition of time-resolved nicotinamide adenine (phosphate) dinucleotide [NAD(P)H] fluorescence may provide metabolic information from the tumor environment to further improve overall tumor detection.AimWe investigate the ability of pulse sampling, fiber-based FLIm to simultaneously image PpIX and NAD(P)H fluorescence of glioma infiltrative margins in patients.ApproachA mesoscopic fiber-based point-scanning FLIm device (355&nbsp;nm pulses) was used to simultaneously resolve the fluorescence decay of PpIX (629/53&nbsp;nm) and NAD(P)H (470/28&nbsp;nm). The FLIm device enabled data acquisition at room light and rapid (<33â€‰â€‰ms) augmentation of FLIm parameters on the surgical field-of-view. FLIm measurements from superficial tumors and tissue areas around the resection margins were performed on three glioblastoma patients in vivo following inspection of PpIX visible fluorescence with a conventional neurosurgical microscope. Microbiopsies were collected from FLIm imaged areas for histopathological evaluation.ResultsThe average lifetime from PpIX and NAD(P)H fluorescence distinguished between tumor and surrounding tissue. FLIm measurements of resection margins presented a range of PpIX and NAD(P)H lifetime values (Ï„PpIXâ€‰â€‰âŸâ€‰â€‰â€‰â€‰âˆ¼â€‰â€‰3 to 14&nbsp;ns, Ï„NAD(P)Hâ€‰â€‰=â€‰â€‰3 to 6&nbsp;ns) associated with unaffected tissue and areas of low-density tumor infiltration.ConclusionsIntraoperative FLIm could simultaneously detect the emission of PpIX and NAD(P)H from patients in vivo during craniotomy procedures. This approach doubles as a clinical tool to identify tumor areas while performing tissue resection and as a research tool to study tumor microenvironmental changes in vivo. Intraoperative FLIm of 5-ALA-induced PpIX and tissue autofluorescence makes a promising surgical adjunct to guide tumor resection surgery."

Potentially, these records could be used to determine spatial patterns of plant species rarity and endemism. We test the integration of a large South Korean species record database with Rabinowitz rarity classes. Rabinowitz proposed seven classes of species rarity using three variables: geographic range, habitat specificity, and local population size. We estimated the range size and local abundance of 2,215 plant species from species occurrence records and habitat specificity as the number of landcover types each species' records were found in. We classified each species into a rarity class or as common, compared species composition by class to national lists, and mapped the spatial pattern of species richness for each rarity class. Species were classed to narrow or wide geographic ranges using 315&nbsp;km, the average from a range size index of all species (D max), based on maximum distance between observations. There were four classes each within the narrow and wide range groups, sorted using cutoffs of local abundance and habitat specificity. Nationally listed endangered species only appeared in the narrow-range classes, while nationally listed endemic species appeared in almost all classes. Species richness in most rarity classes was high in northeastern South Korea especially for species with narrow ranges. Policy implications. Large presence-only surveys may be able to estimate some classes of rarity better than others, but modification to include estimates of local abundance and habitat types, could greatly increase their utility. Application of the Rabinowitz rarity framework to such surveys can extend their utility beyond species distribution models and can identify areas that need further surveys and for conservation priority. Future studies should be aware of the subjectivity of the rarity classification and that regional scale implementations of the framework may differ."

The epigenetic layer of DNA methylation shows dynamic developmental changes and molecular memory of in utero experiences, particularly in placenta, a fetal tissue discarded at birth. However, current array-based methods to identify novel ASD risk genes lack coverage of the most structurally and epigenetically variable regions of the human genome.ResultsWe use whole genome bisulfite sequencing in placenta samples from prospective ASD studies to discover a previously uncharacterized ASD risk gene, LOC105373085, renamed NHIP. Out of 134 differentially methylated regions associated with ASD in placental samples, a cluster at 22q13.33 corresponds to a 118-kb hypomethylated block that replicates in two additional cohorts. Within this locus, NHIP is functionally characterized as a nuclear peptide-encoding transcript with high expression in brain, and increased expression following neuronal differentiation or hypoxia, but decreased expression in ASD placenta and brain. NHIP overexpression increases cellular proliferation and alters expression of genes regulating synapses and neurogenesis, overlapping significantly with known ASD risk genes and NHIP-associated genes in ASD brain. A common structural variant disrupting the proximity of NHIP to a fetal brain enhancer is associated with NHIP expression and methylation levels and ASD risk, demonstrating a common genetic influence.ConclusionsTogether, these results identify and initially characterize a novel environmentally responsive ASD risk gene relevant to brain development in a hitherto under-characterized region of the human genome."

We applied log-linear (Poisson) event-history regression models for clustered person-period data to adjust for sociodemographic variables and pre-procedure health status when examining associations between these contraceptive procedures and claims related to contraceptive failure, complications, and pain in the first year post-procedure.Key resultsWe identified 35,705 patients who had a levonorgestrel IUC placed, 23,628 patients who had a copper IUC placed, and 23,965 patients who underwent laparoscopic tubal ligation. In unadjusted analyses, rates of pregnancy within 1 year were similar following levonorgestrel IUC (2.40%) or copper IUC placement (2.99%) or tubal ligation (2.64%). In adjusted analyses, compared to tubal ligation, pregnancy was less common following placement of a levonorgestrel IUC (adj IRR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-0.82) and similar with placement of a copper IUC (adj IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82-1.05). Procedural complications such as infection (0.35% vs. 2.91%) were significantly less common with IUC placement than tubal ligation. Claims for pelvic and abdominal pain decreased in frequency with time since all procedures; 6 to 12 months post-procedure, pelvic pain claims were less common after levonorgestrel IUC (adj IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.65-0.73) or copper IUC placement (adj IRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66-0.75) than tubal ligation.ConclusionsIUC appears at least as effective as laparoscopic tubal ligation at 1-year post-procedure with lower rates of infection and pelvic pain 6 to 12 months post-procedure.Clinical trial registrationNCT03438682."

"FINK, Kyle",Cell-Based Delivery Approaches for DNA-Binding Domains to the Central Nervous System,"Advancements in programmable DNA-Binding Proteins (DBDs) that target the genome, such as zinc fingers, transcription activator-like effectors, and Cas9, have broadened drug target design beyond traditional protein substrates. Effective delivery methodologies remain a major barrier in targeting the central nervous system. Currently, adeno-associated virus is the most wellvalidated delivery system for the delivery of DBDs towards the central nervous with multiple, ongoing clinical trials. While effective in transducing neuronal cells, viral delivery systems for DBDs remain problematic due to inherent viral packaging limits or immune responses that hinder translational potential. Direct administration of DBDs or encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles may provide alternative means towards delivering gene therapies into the central nervous system. This review will evaluate the strengths and limitations of current DBD delivery strategies in vivo. Furthermore, this review will discuss the use of adult stem cells as a putative delivery vehicle for DBDs and the potential advantages that these systems have over previous methodologies."

"DECARLI, Charles","Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Liver Fibrosis, and Regional Amyloid-Î² and Tau Pathology in Middle-Aged Adults: The Framingham Study.","BACKGROUND: Liver steatosis and fibrosis are emerging as risk factors for multiple extrahepatic health conditions; however, their relationship with Alzheimers disease pathology is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and FIB-4, a non-invasive index of advanced fibrosis, are associated with brain amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) and tau pathology. METHODS: The study sample included Framingham Study participants from the Offspring and Third generation cohorts who attended exams 9 (2011-2014) and 2 (2008-2011), respectively. Participants underwent 11C-Pittsburgh Compound-B amyloid and 18F-Flortaucipir tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and abdomen computed tomography, or had information on all components of the FIB-4 index. Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship of NAFLD and FIB-4 with regional tau and AÎ², adjusting for potential confounders and multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Of the subsample with NAFLD information (Nâ€Š=â€Š169; mean age 52Â±9â€Šy; 57% males), 57 (34%) had NAFLD. Of the subsample with information on liver fibrosis (Nâ€Š=â€Š177; mean age 50Â±10â€Šy; 51% males), 34 (19%) had advanced fibrosis (FIB-4â€Š>â€Š1.3). Prevalent NAFLD was not associated with AÎ² or tau PET. However, FIB-4 index was significantly associated with increased rhinal tau (Î²=â€Š1.03Â±0.33, pâ€Š=â€Š0.002). Among individuals with prevalent NAFLD, FIB-4 was related to inferior temporal, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal and rhinal tau (Î²=â€Š2.01Â±0.47, pâ€Š<â€Š0.001; Î²=â€Š1.60Â±0.53, pâ€Š=â€Š0.007, and Î²=â€Š1.59Â±0.47, pâ€Š=â€Š0.003 and Î²=â€Š1.60Â±0.42, pâ€Š=â€Š0.001, respectively) and to AÎ² deposition overall and in the inferior temporal and parahippocampal regions (Î²=â€Š1.93Â±0.47, pâ€Š<â€Š0.001; Î²=â€Š1.59Â±0.38, pâ€Š<â€Š0.001, and Î²=â€Š1.52Â±0.54, pâ€Š=â€Š0.008, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggests a possible association between liver fibrosis and early Alzheimers disease pathology, independently of cardio-metabolic risk factors."
"CARNEY, Randy P",Homogenous high enhancement surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates by simple hierarchical tuning of gold nanofoams,"Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful tool for vibrational spectroscopy, providing orders of magnitude increase in chemical sensitivity compared to spontaneous Raman scattering. Yet it remains a challenge to synthesize robust, uniform SERS substrates quickly and easily. Lithographic approaches to produce substrates can achieve high, uniform sensitivity but are expensive and complex, thus difficult to scale. Facile solution-phase chemical approaches often result in unreliable SERS substrates due to heterogeneous arrangement of ""hot spots"" throughout the material. Here we demonstrate the synthesis and characterization of a homogeneous gold nanofoam (AuNF) substrate produced by a rapid, one-pot, four-ingredient synthetic approach. AuNFs are rapidly nucleated with macroscale porosity and then chemically roughened to produce nanoscale features that confer homogeneous and high signal enhancement (~109) across large areas, a comparable performance to lithographically produced substrates."

Dependency on field size, depth, dose, dose rate, and temperature were evaluated in a water tank and compared to calibration data from commissioning and annual QA. Angularity was evaluated with a 3D printed phantom. The clinical evaluation was first performed in two cadaver dogs, and then in three companion animal dogs receiving radiation therapy for nasal tumors. A treatment planning CT scan was performed for cadavers and clinical patients. Prior to treatment, the probe was inserted into the radiation field. Radiation was then delivered and measured with the scintillator. For cadavers, the treatment was repeated after making an intentional shift in patient position to simulate a treatment error.ResultsIn the preclinical measurements the dose differed from annual measurements as follows: field size -0.77 to 0.43%, depth dose -0.36 to 1.14%, dose -0.54 to 2.93%, dose rate 0.3 to 3.6%, and angularity -1.18 to 0.01%. Temperature dependency required a correction factor of 0.11%/Â°C. In the two cadavers, the dose differed by -1.17 to 0.91%. The device correctly detected the treatment error when the heads were intentionally laterally shifted. In three canine clinical patients treated in multiple fractions, the detected dose ranged from 98.33 to 103.15%.ConclusionResults of this new device are promising although more work is necessary to fully validate it for clinical dosimetry."
"SILVERMAN, Jill L",Emulating Near-Roadway Exposure to Traffic-Related Air Pollution via Real-Time Emissions from a Major Freeway Tunnel System,"Epidemiological and toxicological studies continue to demonstrate correlative and causal relationships between exposure to traffic-related air pollution and various metrics of adverse pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neurological health effects. The key challenge for in vivo studies is replicating real-world, near-roadway exposure dynamics in laboratory animal models that mimic true human exposures. The advantage of animal models is the accelerated time scales to show statistically significant physiological and/or behavioral response. This work describes a novel exposure facility adjacent to a major freeway tunnel system that provides a platform for real-time chronic exposure studies. The primary conclusion is that particulate matter (PM) concentrations at this facility are routinely well below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), but studies completed to date still demonstrate significant neurological and cardiovascular effects. Internal combustion engines produce large numbers of ultrafine particles that contribute negligible mass to the atmosphere relative to NAAQS regulated PM2.5 but have high surface area and mobility in the body. It is posited here that current federal and state air quality standards are thus insufficient to fully protect human health, most notably the developing and aging brain, due to regulatory gaps for ultrafine particles."
"ASCHER, Simon B",Associations of Highâ€Sensitivity Troponin and Natriuretic Peptide Levels With Serious Adverse Events in SPRINT,"Background Assessing the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) during hypertension treatment is important for understanding the benefit-harm trade-offs of lower blood pressure goals. It is unknown whether high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) provide information about SAEs. Methods and Results In SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP were measured at baseline in 8828 (94.3%) and 8836 (94.4%) participants, respectively. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP associations with a composite of SPRINT's SAEs of interest: hypotension, syncope, bradycardia, acute kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities, and injurious falls. Elevations in hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP were associated with increased composite SAE risk (hazard ratio [HR] per 2-fold higher hs-cTnT: 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06â€’1.25; HR per 2-fold higher NT-proBNP: 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05â€’1.14). Compared with both hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP in the lower tertiles, both biomarkers in the highest tertile was associated with increased composite SAE risk (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.32â€’1.84). Composite SAE risk was higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group for participants with both biomarkers in the lower tertiles, but similar between treatment groups for participants with both biomarkers in the highest tertile (P for interaction=0.008). Conclusions Elevations in hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP individually and in combination are associated with higher composite SAE risk in SPRINT. The differential impact of blood pressure treatment on SAE risk across combined biomarker categories may have implications for identifying individuals with more favorable benefit-harm profiles for intensive blood pressure lowering."

Each SWD was matched with 2 controls, one from their institution and, whenever possible, one from their cohort for Medical College Admission Test score and self-reported gender. Outcome measures included final attempt Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge scores, time to graduation, leave of absence, matching on first attempt, and matching to primary care.ResultsA total of 171 SWDs and 341 controls were included; the majority of SWDs had cognitive/learning disabilities (118/171, 69.0%). Compared with controls, SWDs with physical/sensory disabilities had similar times to graduation (88.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.0, 100.0 vs 95.1%, 95% CI: 90.3, 99.8; P = .20), Step 1 scores (229.6 vs 233.4; P = .118), and match on first attempt (93.9%, 95% CI: 86.9, 100.0 vs 94.6%, 95% CI: 91.8, 97.4; P = .842), while SWDs with cognitive/learning disabilities had lower Step 1 scores (219.4; P < .001) and were less likely to graduate on time (81.2%, 95% CI: 69.2, 93.2; P = .003) and match on first attempt (85.3%, 95% CI: 78.0, 92.7; P = .009). Accommodated SWDs had Step 1 scores that were 5.9 points higher than nonaccommodated SWDs (95% CI: -0.7, 12.5; P = .08).ConclusionsStructural barriers remain for SWDs with cognitive/learning disabilities, which could be partially mitigated by accommodations on high-stakes exams."

METHODS:A retrospective cohort study was performed for patients undergoing salvage laryngectomy with clinically and radiographically negative neck disease between 1998 and 2015 (nâ€‰=â€‰210). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed. RESULTS:PTND was performed on 77/210 patients (36%). The PTND cohort had a greater proportion of advanced T classification (rT3/rT4) tumors (78%) than subjects without PTND (55%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). There was a 14% rate of occult nodal metastases in the paratracheal basin; of these, 55% did not have pathologic lateral neck disease. Multivariate analysis controlling for tumor site, tumor stage, and pathologic lateral neck disease demonstrated that PTND was associated with improved overall survival [OS] (pâ€‰=â€‰0.03; hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.96), disease-free survival [DFS] (pâ€‰=â€‰0.03; HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31-0.96), and distant DFS survival (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01; HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11-0.77). The rate of hypocalcemia did not differ between subjects who underwent bilateral PTND, unilateral PTND, or no PTND (pâ€‰=â€‰0.19 at discharge, pâ€‰=â€‰0.17 at last follow-up). CONCLUSIONS:PTND at the time of salvage laryngectomy was more common in patients with rT3/rT4 tumors and was associated with improved OS and DFS, with no effect on hypocalcemia. In patients undergoing PTND, the finding of occult paratracheal metastases was often independent of lateral neck metastases."
"BIRKELAND, Andrew C",Wholeâ€Exome Sequencing of Sinonasal Small Cell Carcinoma Arising within a Papillary Schneiderian Carcinoma In Situ,"ObjectiveThe pathogenetic underpinnings of extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (EPSCCs) of the head and neck are poorly understood. We sought to describe the clinical case and whole-exome DNA sequencing data of a patient with sinonasal Schneiderian carcinoma in situ whose tumor progressed to small cell carcinoma (SCC).Study designCase report and whole-exome sequencing of tumor DNA.SettingAcademic medical center.Subjects and methodsA 52-year-old man with sinonasal Schneiderian carcinoma in situ whose tumor progressed to small cell carcinoma. We performed whole-exome genetic sequencing and copy-number variation (CNV) analysis of tumor and normal DNA extracted from flash-frozen, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples.ResultsA total of 93 high-confidence, nonsynonymous somatic mutation events were identified in sinonasal SCC, including loss-of-function mutations in TP53, MAML3, a transcriptional coactivator of the Notch pathway, and GAS6, an activating ligand of the TAM family of tyrosine kinase receptors. Focal amplifications of chromosomal regions 6p25-11.1, containing SOX4 and VEGFA, and 14q32.1-32.3, containing AKT1 and the Notch inhibitory ligand DLK1, were also seen. Further CNV analysis revealed deletions in the critical cell cycle regulators CDKN2A, RB1, RBL1, and RBL2 and the chromatin modifier EP300.ConclusionsSmall cell carcinoma may rarely arise from sinonasal Schneiderian carcinoma in situ and exhibits similar genomic aberrations (eg, SOX amplification, Notch pathway inactivation) to pulmonary small cell carcinoma."

"BARILE, Daniela",Dietary Fiber to Starch Ratio Affects Bovine Milk Oligosaccharide Profiles.,"BackgroundBovine milk oligosaccharides (BMOs) have several demonstrated and hypothesized benefits including roles in cognitive development and antipathogenic activities, making them promising ingredients for infant formulas and nutraceutical applications. BMO extraction from bovine milk is challenged by low concentrations relative to nonbioactive simple sugars like lactose. BMO abundances are known to vary with a cow's lactation stage, breed, and parity, but these characteristics are difficult to modify in existing dairy herds. In contrast, diet modification is an accessible target, and is already known to influence milk yield, lipid content, protein levels, and monosaccharide compositions.ObjectivesTo determine the impact of a low starch high fiber versus a high starch low fiber diet on overall BMO profiles and individual BMO abundances in Holstein dairy cattle.MethodsMilk samples were collected from 59 midlactation Holsteins in a crossover study featuring dietary modification with either a low starch high fiber or high starch low fiber feed. BMO profiles were evaluated by nano-LC quadrupole time-of-flight tandem MS, and differences in BMO abundances between diets were evaluated using linear mixed effects modeling.ResultsA total of 19 BMOs were identified across the sample set, including 4 large fucosylated compounds. Seven BMOs were found to have significantly more positive percent changes in yield-adjusted abundance from the pre-experiment baseline period for milk samples collected during feeding with the low starch high fiber diet compared with the high starch low fiber diet.ConclusionsConsuming the low starch high fiber diet promoted greater overall BMO production than the high starch low fiber diet in a population of midlactation Holsteins. Additionally, this study afforded the opportunity to investigate the impact of other factors potentially influencing BMO abundances, furthering understanding of how dairy herd management practices can positively impact milk composition and support the potential use of BMOs as functional ingredients."
"FRAGOSO, Ruben C",Fatty acid oxidation fuels glioblastoma radioresistance with CD47-mediated immune evasion,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains the top challenge to radiotherapy with only 25% one-year survival after diagnosis. Here, we reveal that co-enhancement of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) enzymes (CPT1A, CPT2 and ACAD9) and immune checkpoint CD47 is dominant in recurrent GBM patients with poor prognosis. A glycolysis-to-FAO metabolic rewiring is associated with CD47 anti-phagocytosis in radioresistant GBM cells and regrown GBM after radiation in syngeneic mice. Inhibition of FAO by CPT1 inhibitor etomoxir or CRISPR-generated CPT1A-/-, CPT2-/-, ACAD9-/- cells demonstrate that FAO-derived acetyl-CoA upregulates CD47 transcription via NF-ÎºB/RelA acetylation. Blocking FAO impairs tumor growth and reduces CD47 anti-phagocytosis. Etomoxir combined with anti-CD47 antibody synergizes radiation control of regrown tumors with boosted macrophage phagocytosis. These results demonstrate that enhanced fat acid metabolism promotes aggressive growth of GBM with CD47-mediated immune evasion. The FAO-CD47 axis may be targeted to improve GBM control by eliminating the radioresistant phagocytosis-proofing tumor cells in GBM radioimmunotherapy."
"RONCALI, Emilie",The Impact of Injection Distance to Bifurcations on Yttrium-90 Distribution in&nbsp;Liver Cancer Radioembolization,"PurposeTo model the effect of the injection location on the distribution of yttrium-90 (90Y) microspheres in the liver during radioembolization using computational simulation and to determine the potential effects of radial movements of the catheter tip.Materials and methodsNumerical studies were conducted using images from a representative patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. The right hepatic artery (RHA) was segmented from contrast-enhanced cone-beam computed tomography scans. The blood flow was investigated in the trunk of the RHA using numerical simulations for 6 injection position scenarios at 2 sites located at a distance of approximately 5 and 20 mm upstream of the first bifurcation (RHA diameters of approximately 4.6 mm). The 90Y delivery to downstream vessels was calculated from the simulated hepatic artery hemodynamics.ResultsVarying the injection location along the RHA and across the vessel cross-section resulted in different simulated microsphere distributions in the downstream vascular bed. When the catheter tip was 5 mm upstream of the bifurcation, 90Y distribution in the downstream branches varied by as much as 53% with a 1.5-mm radial movement of the tip. However, the catheter radial movement had a weaker effect on the microsphere distribution when the injection plane was farther from the first bifurcation (20 mm), with a maximum delivery variation of 9% to a downstream branch.ConclusionsAn injection location far from bifurcations is recommended to minimize the effect of radial movements of the catheter tip on the microsphere distribution."

Microvesicles from a variety of parent cells within the vascular system increase in numerous pathological states. Red blood cell-derived MVs (RMVs) are relatively less studied than other types of circulating MVs despite red blood cells (RBCs) being the most abundant intravascular cell. This may be in part due the echoes of past misconceptions that RBCs were merely floating anucleate bags of hemoglobin rather than dynamic and responsive cells. The initial aim of this study was to maximize the concentration of RMVs derived from various blood or blood products by focusing on the optimal isolation conditions without creating more MVs from artificial manipulation. We found that allowing RBCs to sediment overnight resulted in a continuum in size of RBC membrane-containing fragments or vesicles extending beyond the 1 Âµm size limit suggested by many as the maximal size of an MV. Additionally, dilution and centrifugation factors were studied that altered the resultant MV population concentration. The heterogeneous size of RMVs was confirmed in mice models of hemolytic anemia. This methodological finding establishes a new paradigm in that it blurs the line between RBC, fragment, and RMV as well as suggests that the concentration of circulating RMVs may be widely underestimated given that centrifugation removes the majority of such RBC-derived membrane-containing particles."

However, because of their rapid metabolism by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), EETs are unable to remain bioavailable. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether local sEH inhibition could prevent inflammatory hyperalgesia in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) of rats. For that, rats were pre-treated with an intra-TMJ injection of TPPU, followed by the noxious stimulus (1.5% of formalin intra-articular) to evaluate nociceptive behavior. Histological analysis was conducted to explore the inflammatory exudate and mast cell degranulation. Periarticular tissue over the TMJ was used to measure inflammatory lipids and cytokines/chemokine by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). We demonstrated that peripheral pretreatment with TPPU prevents formalin-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia in the TMJ, and this effect is strictly local. Moreover, TPPU mitigates the leukocyte exudate in the TMJ, as well as inflammatory lipids mediators. Mast cell number and degranulation were abrogated by TPPU, and the inflammatory cytokine levels were decreased by TPPU. On the other hand, TPPU up-regulated the release of interleukin 10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine. We provide evidence that locally sEH by intra-TMJ injection of TPPU produces an antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effect on rats' TMJ."

"KIM, Tae Youn Y",A community-based survey to assess risk for one health challenges in rural Philippines using a mobile application,"BackgroundRecent emerging and re-emerging diseases in animals and humans show the vulnerability of humans, animals, and crops to disease outbreaks and the large potential impact on health, food security, and economies worldwide. A technology-enabled One Health (OH) surveillance program offers an opportunity for early detection and response as well as prevention of disease outbreaks in resource-limited settings. As an initial step toward developing the surveillance program, we aimed to identify at-risk groups of households for potential shared health challenges at the human-animal-environmental interface in a rural community of the Philippines.MethodsA cross-sectional household survey was conducted in the municipality of Los BaÃ±os in proximity (63 kilometers south) to Metro Manila by enumerators living in the same community. Twenty-four enumerators conducted household interviews asking a) household characteristics including ownership of animals and crops; b) awareness, beliefs and knowledge about OH; c) family-level health practices related to sanitation, hygiene, and food safety; and d) risk factors for potential OH issues. All data collection and transferring process were streamlined using a mobile application.ResultsOf 6,055 participating households, 68% reported having one or more of gardens, farms, and animals for various reasons. While only 2% of the households have heard about OH, 97% believed they can get disease from animals, plants or the environment. A latent class analysis with nine risk factors for potential OH issues suggested that 46% of the households were at moderate to high risk for exposure to zoonotic pathogens and environmental contaminants.ConclusionOur findings indicate that there are unaddressed threats to human, animal, and plant health. Given the importance of the interconnections between the health of humans, animals, and plants, further evaluations of the at-risk households would be necessary to mitigate potential shared health threats in the community. Further, our study demonstrates that mHealth technology can provide an opportunity to systematically assess potential one health problems in the rural communities with limited internet connection."

We evaluate the accuracy of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo product using available field measurements at Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) and Cloud and Radiation Testbed-Southern Great Plains (CART/SGP) stations and examine the consistency between the MODIS surface albedos and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) top-of-the-atmosphere albedos as well as historical global albedos from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) observations. A comparison with the field measurements shows that the MODIS surface albedo generally meets an absolute accuracy requirement of 0.02 for our study sites during April-September 2001, with the root mean square errors less than 0.018. Larger differences appear in the winter season probably due to the increased heterogeneity of surface reflectivity in the presence of snow. To examine the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the validation of the MODIS albedos using fine resolution field measurements, we derive an intermediate albedo product from four Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images at 30-m spatial resolution as a surrogate for the distributed field measurements. The surface albedo is relatively homogeneous over the study stations in growing seasons, and therefore the validation during April-September is supported. A case study over three SURFRAD stations reveals that the MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function model is able to capture the solar zenith angle dependence of surface albedo as shown by the field measurements. We also find that the MODIS surface shortwave albedo is consistent with the contemporary and collocated CERES top-of atmosphere albedos derived directly from broadband observations. The MODIS albedo is also well correlated with historical surface albedos derived from AVHRR and ERBE observations, and a high bias of 0.016 and a low bias of 0.034 compared to those of the latter albedos are reasonable considering the differences in instruments and retrieval algorithms as well as environmental changes."
"ROCKWELL, Nathan C",Proteinâ€“chromophore interactions controlling photoisomerization in red/green cyanobacteriochromes,"Photoreceptors in the phytochrome superfamily use 15,16-photoisomerization of a linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophore to photoconvert between two states with distinct spectral and biochemical properties. Canonical phytochromes include master regulators of plant growth and development in which light signals trigger interconversion between a red-absorbing 15Z dark-adapted state and a metastable, far-red-absorbing 15E photoproduct state. Distantly related cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) carry out a diverse range of photoregulatory functions in cyanobacteria and exhibit considerable spectral diversity. One widespread CBCR subfamily typically exhibits a red-absorbing 15Z dark-adapted state similar to that of phytochrome that gives rise to a distinct green-absorbing 15E photoproduct. This red/green CBCR subfamily also includes red-inactive examples that fail to undergo photoconversion, providing an opportunity to study protein-chromophore interactions that either promote photoisomerization or block it. In this work, we identified a conserved lineage of red-inactive CBCRs. This enabled us to identify three substitutions sufficient to block photoisomerization in photoactive red/green CBCRs. The resulting red-inactive variants faithfully replicated the fluorescence and circular dichroism properties of naturally occurring examples. Converse substitutions restored photoconversion in naturally red-inactive CBCRs. This work thus identifies protein-chromophore interactions that control the fate of the excited-state population in red/green cyanobacteriochromes."

K07-0010 in 2012 by Satoshi ÅŒmura and co-workers that exhibit modest anti-trypanosomal activity. Herein we demonstrate the first syntheses of these natural products and their epimers. Stereoselective dirhodium-catalyzed C-H insertion reactions with a donor/donor carbene construct the substituted isochroman core in the key bond-forming step. The syntheses are completed without the use of protecting groups and feature a late-stage Wacker oxidation. Incongruent NMR spectra between natural and synthetic samples revealed the structural misassignment of panowamycinâ€…A and veramycinâ€…F. Computational NMR studies suggested panowamycinâ€…A to be an alternate diastereomer, which was confirmed by synthesizing this isomer.

"ATSUMI, Shota",Synthetic Biology Approaches for Improving Chemical Production in Cyanobacteria,"Biological chemical production has gained traction in recent years as a promising renewable alternative to traditional petrochemical based synthesis. Of particular interest in the field of metabolic engineering are photosynthetic microorganisms capable of sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide. CO2 levels have continued to rise at alarming rates leading to an increasingly uncertain climate. CO2 can be sequestered by engineered photosynthetic microorganisms and used for chemical production, representing a renewable production method for valuable chemical commodities such as biofuels, plastics, and food additives. The main challenges in using photosynthetic microorganisms for chemical production stem from the seemingly inherent limitations of carbon fixation and photosynthesis resulting in slower growth and lower average product titers compared to heterotrophic organisms. Recently, there has been an increase in research around improving photosynthetic microorganisms as renewable chemical production hosts. This review will discuss the various efforts to overcome the intrinsic inefficiencies of carbon fixation and photosynthesis, including rewiring carbon fixation and photosynthesis, investigating alternative carbon fixation pathways, installing sugar catabolism to supplement carbon fixation, investigating newly discovered fast growing photosynthetic species, and using new synthetic biology tools such as CRISPR to radically alter metabolism."
"SALCEDO, Edgardo",Pediatric suicide by violent means: a cry for help and a call for action,"BackgroundSuicide is the second most common cause of death among adolescents and young adults. In the pediatric population, gunshot wounds (GSWs) and hangings are common mechanisms of pediatric suicide. Comorbid psychiatric illness is prevalent in this population, but psychiatric resource utilization after self-inflicted traumatic injury is not well characterized.MethodsWe analyzed patients <â€‰18&nbsp;years old presenting to a level 1 pediatric trauma center after suicide attempt by GSW, hanging, or jumping from a height from 2009 to 2019. The primary outcome was psychiatric resource utilization. Secondary outcomes included prior emergency department (ED) visits to identify prior opportunities for intervention.ResultsOf 6538 pediatric trauma patients, there were 219 GSWs, 7 hangings, and 7 jumps from height, for a total of 233 patients. Of these, 14 presented following a suicide attempt (four GSWs, six hangings, and four jumps, total 6.0%). Half of these patients died due to their injuries. Self-inflicted GSWs had the highest mortality (75%). Most surviving patients were placed on involuntary psychiatric holds (nâ€‰=â€‰5/7, 71.4%), and three patients were discharged to an inpatient psychiatric hospital (nâ€‰=â€‰3/7, 42.9%). Five of the 14 patients had prior ED visits (35.7%), and of these, 60% were for suicidal ideation or suicide attempts.ConclusionsAmong pediatric trauma patients, suicide attempts are rare, but are highly lethal, with the highest mortality rate seen in self-inflicted GSWs. Psychiatric resource utilization is high both during and after the hospitalization. Prior ED visits may represent opportunities for depression and suicidality screening in this at-risk population."
"DEERE, Jesse D",Early post-infection treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected macaques with human convalescent plasma with high neutralizing activity had no antiviral effects but moderately reduced lung inflammation,"Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there was a high level of optimism based on observational studies and small controlled trials that treating hospitalized patients with convalescent plasma from COVID-19 survivors (CCP) would be an important immunotherapy. However, as more data from controlled trials became available, the results became disappointing, with at best moderate evidence of efficacy when CCP with high titers of neutralizing antibodies was used early in infection. To better understand the potential therapeutic efficacy of CCP, and to further validate SARS-CoV-2 infection of macaques as a reliable animal model for testing such strategies, we inoculated 12 adult rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 by intratracheal and intranasal routes. One day later, 8 animals were infused with pooled human CCP with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies (RVPN NT50 value of 3,003), while 4 control animals received normal human plasma. Animals were monitored for 7 days. Animals treated with CCP had detectable but low levels of antiviral antibodies after infusion. In comparison to the control animals, CCP-treated animals had similar levels of viral RNA in upper and lower respiratory tract secretions, similar detection of viral RNA in lung tissues by in situ hybridization, but lower amounts of infectious virus in the lungs. CCP-treated animals had a moderate, but statistically significant reduction in interstitial pneumonia, as measured by comprehensive lung histology. Thus overall, therapeutic benefits of CCP were marginal and inferior to results obtained earlier with monoclonal antibodies in this animal model. By highlighting strengths and weaknesses, data of this study can help to further optimize nonhuman primate models to provide proof-of-concept of intervention strategies, and guide the future use of convalescent plasma against SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other newly emerging respiratory viruses."

Herein, ultra-steep-slope MoS2 resistive-gate field-effect transistors (RG-FETs) by integrating atomic-scale-resistive filamentary with conventional MoS2 transistors, demonstrating an ultra-low SS below 1 mV dec-1 at room temperature are reported. The abrupt resistance transition of the nanoscale-resistive filamentary ensures dramatic change in gate potential, and switches the device on and off, leading to ultra-steep SS. Simultaneously, RG-FETs demonstrate a high on/off ratio of 2.76 Ã— 107 with superior reproducibility and reliability.

The purpose of this study was twofold: 1) to quantify ventilation/perfusion relationships in lung cancer patients using a new functional imaging approach, gallium-68 (68Ga)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT); and 2) to compare ventilation/perfusion matching with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Voxel-wise correlations between ventilation and perfusion varied widely among 19 patients (range: 0.26-0.88). 68Ga-PET/CT-measured percent gas exchanging lung volume was moderately correlated with DLCO (â‰¤0.59). Our findings suggested that 68Ga-PET/CT ventilation/perfusion imaging provided complementary information and a reasonable surrogate for gas exchange in lung cancer patients."
"SHAPIRO, Daniel I",The association between mental health stigma and face emotion recognition in individuals at risk for psychosis.,"Self-stigma has been associated with reduced accuracy of face emotion recognition in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR). Stigma may also relate to slowing of performance during cognitive tasks for which a negative stereotype is relevant. This study aimed to investigate the association of mental illness stigma with face emotion recognition among CHR individuals. Participants were 143 CHR individuals identified using the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS). Face emotion recognition was assessed using the Penn Emotion Recognition Task (ER-40). Stigma was assessed using discrimination, stereotype awareness, and stereotype agreement subscales of the Mental Health Attitudes Interview for CHR. We tested associations of ER-40 accuracy and response times with these stigma variables, including the role of clinical and demographic factors. Racial/ethnic minoritized participants had higher attenuated positive symptoms than non-minoritized participants. Longer ER-40 response times were correlated with greater stereotype agreement (r=.17, p=.045) and discrimination (r=.22, p=.012). A regression model predicting ER-40 response times revealed an interaction of stereotype agreement with minoritized status (p=.008), with slower response times for minoritized participants as stereotype agreement increased. Greater disorganized symptoms and male gender also predicted longer response times. ER-40 accuracy was not associated with stigma. Overall, minoritized CHR individuals with greater internalized stigma took longer to identify face emotions. Future research is needed to assess whether slower response times are specific to social cues, and if internalized stigma interferes with performance in real-world social situations. Reducing stigma may be an important target for interventions that aim to improve social skills."

Autophagy is a conserved cellular recycling process and has well-established roles in nutrient starvation responses and cellular homeostasis. Recently, the role of autophagy in immunity has become increasingly evident. However, our knowledge about plant autophagy remains limited, and how this fundamental cellular process is involved in plant immunity is still somewhat perplexing. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the positive and negative roles of autophagy in plant immunity and how different microbes exploit this process to their own advantage. The dualistic role of autophagy in plant immunity emphasizes that much remains to be explored in this area."
"FELDMANN, Mitchell J",Average semivariance directly yields accurate estimates of the genomic variance in complex trait analyses.,"Many important traits in plants, animals, and microbes are polygenic and challenging to improve through traditional marker-assisted selection. Genomic prediction addresses this by incorporating all genetic data in a mixed model framework. The primary method for predicting breeding values is genomic best linear unbiased prediction, which uses the realized genomic relationship or kinship matrix (K) to connect genotype to phenotype. Genomic relationship matrices share information among entries to estimate the observed entries' genetic values and predict unobserved entries' genetic values. One of the main parameters of such models is genomic variance (Ïƒg2), or the variance of a trait associated with a genome-wide sample of DNA polymorphisms, and genomic heritability (hg2); however, the seminal papers introducing different forms of K often do not discuss their effects on the model estimated variance components despite their importance in genetic research and breeding. Here, we discuss the effect of several standard methods for calculating the genomic relationship matrix on estimates of Ïƒg2 and hg2. With current approaches, we found that the genomic variance tends to be either overestimated or underestimated depending on the scaling and centering applied to the marker matrix (Z), the value of the average diagonal element of K, and the assortment of alleles and heterozygosity (H) in the observed population. Using the average semivariance, we propose a new matrix, KASV, that directly yields accurate estimates of Ïƒg2 and hg2 in the observed population and produces best linear unbiased predictors equivalent to routine methods in plants and animals."

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study is to culturally adapt the RDAD for persons with dementia living in community settings of Thailand. METHODS: Key adaptation steps included: 1) assess the community, 2) understand/select the intervention, 3) consult with experts/stakeholders, 4) decide what needs to be adapted, 5) adapt the original program, 6) train staff, and 7) pilot test the adapted materials. RESULTS: Modifications to the original RDAD protocol included changes in number of sessions, mode of delivery, and the specific pleasant activities targeted. The pilot test demonstrated the feasibility and acceptance of the adapted RDAD intervention protocol. Implementers were able to comprehend and implement the core components of the intervention, while family members demonstrated ability to follow instructions, gain knowledge about dementia, and improve skills for setting up realistic goals. CONCLUSION: Following the key adaptation steps outlined above, we were able to successfully modify the RDAD for the Thai cultural context, maintaining core components of the original protocol. Program implementers demonstrated their ability to supervise family caregivers and help them gain the knowledge and skills needed to provide care for older adults with dementia. Findings from the pilot studies were incorporated into final training and intervention protocols currently being implemented and evaluated in a randomized implementation trial in Thailand."

"XIANG, Yang K",Subcellular Propagation of Cardiomyocyte Î²-Adrenergic Activation of Calcium Uptake Involves Internal Î²-Receptors and AKAP7,"Î²-adrenergic receptor (Î²-AR) signaling in cardiac myocytes is central to cardiac function, but spatiotemporal activation within myocytes is unresolved. In rabbit ventricular myocytes, Î²-AR agonists or high extracellular [Ca] were applied locally at one end, to measure Î²-AR signal propagation as Ca-transient (CaT) amplitude and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca uptake. High local [Ca]o, increased CaT amplitude under the pipette faster than did ISO, but was also more spatially restricted. Local isoproterenol (ISO) or norepinephrine (NE) increased CaT amplitude and SR Ca uptake, that spread along the myocyte to the unexposed end. Thus, local [Ca]i decline kinetics reflect spatio-temporal progression of Î²-AR end-effects in myocytes. To test whether intracellular Î²-ARs contribute to this response, we used Î²-AR-blockers that are membrane permeant (propranolol) or not (sotalol). Propranolol completely blocked NE-dependent CaT effects. However, blocking surface Î²-ARs only (sotalol) suppressed only âˆ¼50% of the NE-induced increase in CaT peak and rate of [Ca]i decline, but these changes spread more gradually than NE alone. We also tested whether A-kinase anchoring protein 7Î³ (AKAP7Î³; that interacts with phospholamban) is mobile, such that it might contribute to intracellular spatial propagation of Î²-AR signaling. We found AKAP7Î³ to be highly mobile using fluorescence recovery after photobleach of GFP tagged AKAP7Î³, and that PKA activation accelerated AKAP7Î³-GFP wash-out upon myocyte saponin-permeabilization, suggesting increased AKAP7Î³ mobility. We conclude that local Î²-AR activation can activate SR Ca uptake at remote myocyte sites, and that intracellular Î²-AR and AKAP7Î³ mobility may play a role in this spread of activation."

These deficits, along with PS latency and velocity, were greater in advanced FXTAS stages.ConclusionAS deficits differentiated FXTAS from non-FXTAS premutation carriers implicating top-down control and frontostriatal deterioration. However, the absence of group differences between non-FXTAS carriers and controls in AS and PS markers suggests saccade performance may not be a sensitive enough measure for detecting conversion to FXTAS, but instead more helpful as translational biomarkers of FXTAS progression."

Although pneumonia has traditionally been studied in racehorses, little information is available for non-racing horses. Non-racing horses that died with pulmonary lesions (nâ€‰=â€‰156) were available from cases submitted for autopsy from January 2015 to June 2020. Bronchopneumonia (35%), interstitial pneumonia (29%), embolic pneumonia (21%), granulomatous pneumonia (13%), and pleuritis (2%) were observed in the examined horses. Seventy-four horses died or were euthanized because of pulmonary diseases, and 82 horses died or were euthanized because of non-pulmonary causes but had lung lesions. Of the horses that died from pulmonary causes, the most common finding was bronchopneumonia, with abscesses and/or necrosis in the cranioventral aspect of the lung. Bacteria isolated from cases of bronchopneumonia were Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (48.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.1%), and Actinobacillus equuli subsp. haemolyticus (9.1%). The most common extrapulmonary lesions responsible for death in horses that also had lesions in the lung were mainly in the gastrointestinal system (30%), multiple systems (septicemia and/or toxemia; 27%), and musculoskeletal system (12%). The main postmortem findings in cases of bronchopneumonia of non-racing horses were similar to those reported previously in racehorses. However, some non-racing horses also had interstitial and granulomatous pneumonia, patterns not described previously in racehorses in California, likely as a result of the inclusion of extended age categories for non-racing horses. We also found that the equine lung was frequently affected in cases of sepsis and gastrointestinal problems of infectious origin."
"MCNABB, Bret R",LincRNA#1 knockout alone does not affect polled phenotype in cattle heterozygous for the celtic POLLED allele.,"A long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA#1) is overexpressed in the horn bud region of polled (hornless) bovine fetuses, suggesting a potential role in horn bud suppression. Genome editing was used to test whether the absence of this sequence was associated with the horned phenotype. Two gRNAs with high mutation efficiencies targeting the 5' and the 3' regions flanking the lincRNA#1 sequence were co-injected with Cas9 as ribonucleoprotein complexes into bovine zygotes (nâ€‰=â€‰121) 6&nbsp;h post insemination. Of the resulting blastocysts (nâ€‰=â€‰31), 84% had the expected 3.7&nbsp;kb deletion; of these embryos with the 3.7&nbsp;kb deletions, 88% were biallelic knockouts. Thirty-nine presumptive edited 7-day blastocysts were transferred to 13 synchronized recipient cows resulting in ten pregnancies, five with embryos heterozygous for the dominant PC POLLED allele at the POLLED locus, and five with the recessive pp genotype. Eight (80%) of the resulting fetuses were biallelic lincRNA#1 knockouts, with the remaining two being mosaic. RT-qPCR analysis was used to confirm the absence of lincRNA#1 expression in knockout fetuses. Phenotypic and histological analysis of the genotypically (PCp) POLLED, lincRNA#1 knockout fetuses revealed similar morphology to non-edited, control polled fetuses, indicating the absence of lincRNA#1 alone does not result in a horned phenotype."
"HILL, Michael R",Evaluation of forging process induced residual stress in aluminum die forgings,"Aircraft structural components are being produced from forgings with increasingly complex geometries in a wide range of aerospace alloys. The forging process involves a number of steps required to attain favorable material properties (e.g., heat treatment, rapid quench, cold work stress relieving, and artificial aging). These processing steps, however, also result in the introduction of bulk residual stress. Excessive bulk residual stresses can have negative consequences including: part distortion during machining and/or during service, reduced crack initiation life, increased crack growth rates, and an overall reduction in part life. This presentation will summarize recent work related to quantifying and accounting for residual stress in aluminum die forgings. Key residual stress engineering concepts will be described. Since the artifacts studied are associated with an aircraft supply chain (multiple parts and multiple lots), the results are relevant to the aerospace community. Overall, the results show that forging residual stress is a repeatable phenomenon with approximate repeatability less than 5% of A-basis yield strength."
"ATWILL, Edward R",Dynamic changes in fecal bacterial microbiota of dairy cattle across the production line,"BackgroundMicrobiota play important roles in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of dairy cattle as the communities are responsible for host health, growth, and production performance. However, a systematic characterization and comparison of microbial communities in the GIT of cattle housed in different management units on a modern dairy farm are still lacking. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to evaluate the fecal bacterial communities of 90 dairy cattle housed in 12 distinctly defined management units on a modern dairy farm.ResultsWe found that cattle from management units 5, 6, 8, and 9 had similar bacterial communities while the other units showed varying levels of differences. Hutch calves had a dramatically different bacterial community than adult cattle, with at least 10 genera exclusively detected in their samples but not in non-neonatal cattle. Moreover, we compared fecal bacteria of cattle from every pair of the management units and detailed the number and relative abundance of the significantly differential genera. Lastly, we identified 181 pairs of strongly correlated taxa in the community, showing possible synergistic or antagonistic relationships.ConclusionsThis study assesses the fecal microbiota of cattle from 12 distinctly defined management units along the production line on a California dairy farm. The results highlight the similarities and differences of fecal microbiota between cattle from each pair of the management units. Especially, the data indicate that the newborn calves host very different gut bacterial communities than non-neonatal cattle, while non-neonatal cattle adopt one of the two distinct types of gut bacterial communities with subtle differences among the management units. The gut microbial communities of dairy cattle change dramatically in bacterial abundances at different taxonomic levels along the production line. The findings provide a reference for research and practice in modern dairy farm management."
"SAGESHIMA, Junichiro",Benefit of B7-1 staining and abatacept for treatment-resistant post-transplant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in a predominantly pediatric cohort: time for a reappraisal,"BackgroundPrimary FSGS manifests with nephrotic syndrome and may recur following KT. Failure to respond to conventional therapy after recurrence results in poor outcomes. Evaluation of podocyte B7-1 expression and treatment with abatacept (a B7-1 antagonist) has shown promise but remains controversial.MethodsFrom 2012 to 2020, twelve patients developed post-KT FSGS with nephrotic range proteinuria, failed conventional therapy, and were treated with abatacept. Nine/twelve (<â€‰21&nbsp;years old) experienced recurrent FSGS; three adults developed de novo FSGS, occurring from immediately, up to 8&nbsp;years after KT. KT biopsies were stained for B7-1.ResultsNine KTRs (75%) responded to abatacept. Seven of nine KTRs were B7-1 positive and responded with improvement/resolution of proteinuria. Two patients with rFSGS without biopsies resolved proteinuria after abatacept. Pre-treatment UPCR was 27.0â€‰Â±â€‰20.4 (median 13, range 8-56); follow-up UPCR was 0.8â€‰Â±â€‰1.3 (median 0.2, range 0.07-3.9, pâ€‰<â€‰0.004). Two patients who were B7-1 negative on multiple KT biopsies did not respond to abatacept and lost graft function. One patient developed proteinuria while receiving belatacept, stained B7-1 positive, but did not respond to abatacept.ConclusionsPodocyte B7-1 staining in biopsies of KTRs with post-transplant FSGS identifies a subset of patients who may benefit from abatacept.

To address this limitation, we constructed an autologous humanized mouse (aHM) model with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and tumors from 2 melanoma patients progressing to immunotherapy. Unlike mismatched humanized mouse (mHM) models, generated from cord blood-derived HSPCs and tumors from different donors, the aHM recapitulates a patient-specific tumor microenvironment (TME). When patient tumors were implanted on aHM, mHM, and NOD/SCID/IL2rg-/- (NSG) cohorts, tumors appeared earlier and grew faster on NSG and mHM cohorts. We observed that immune cells differentiating in the aHM were relatively more capable of circulating peripherally, invading into tumors and interacting with the TME. A heterologous, human leukocyte antigen (HLA-A) matched cohort also yielded slower growing tumors than non-HLA-matched mHM, indicating that a less permissive immune environment inhibits tumor progression. When the aHM, mHM, and NSG cohorts were treated with immunotherapies mirroring what the originating patients received, tumor growth in the aHM accelerated, similar to the progression observed in the patients. This rapid growth was associated with decreased immune cell infiltration, reduced interferon gamma (IFNÎ³)-related gene expression, and a reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation, events that were replicated in vitro using tumor-derived cell lines. IMPLICATIONS: Engrafted adult HSPCs give rise to more tumor infiltrative immune cells, increased HLA matching leads to slower tumor initiation and growth, and continuing immunotherapy past progression can paradoxically lead to increased growth."

Many streptococci adhere to protein-attached carbohydrates expressed on cell surfaces using Siglec-like binding regions (SLBRs). The precise glycan repertoire recognized may dictate whether the organism is a strict commensal versus a pathogen. However, it is currently not clear what drives receptor selectivity. Here, we use five representative SLBRs and identify regions of the receptor binding site that are hypervariable in sequence and structure. We show that these regions control the identity of the preferred carbohydrate ligand using chimeragenesis and single amino acid substitutions. We further evaluate how the identity of the preferred ligand affects the interaction with glycoprotein receptors in human saliva and plasma samples. As point mutations can change the preferred human receptor, these studies suggest how streptococci may adapt to changes in the environmental glycan repertoire."
"GLASER, Nicole",Effects of TRAM-34 and minocycline on neuroinflammation caused by diabetic ketoacidosis in a rat model.,"IntroductionDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) causes acute and chronic neuroinflammation that may contribute to cognitive decline in patients with type 1 diabetes. We evaluated the effects of agents that reduce neuroinflammation (triarylmethane-34 (TRAM-34) and minocycline) during and after DKA in a rat model.Research design and methodsJuvenile rats with DKA were treated with insulin and saline, either alone or in combination with TRAM-34 (40â€‰mg/kg intraperitoneally twice daily for 3â€‰days, then daily for 4â€‰days) or minocycline (45â€‰mg/kg intraperitoneally daily for 7â€‰days). We compared cytokine and chemokine concentrations in brain tissue lysates during DKA among the three treatment groups and in normal controls and diabetic controls (n=9-15/group). We also compared brain inflammatory mediator levels in these same groups in adult diabetic rats that were treated for DKA as juveniles.ResultsBrain tissue concentrations of chemokine (C-C) motif ligand (CCL)3, CCL5 and interferon (IFNÎ³) were increased during acute DKA, as were brain cytokine composite scores. Both treatments reduced brain inflammatory mediator levels during acute DKA. TRAM-34 predominantly reduced chemokine concentrations (chemokine (C-X-C) motif ligand (CXCL-1), CCL5) whereas minocycline had broader effects, (reducing CXCL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNFÎ±), IFNÎ³, interleukin (IL) 2, IL-10 and IL-17A). Brain inflammatory mediator levels were elevated in adult rats that had DKA as juveniles, compared with adult diabetic rats without previous DKA, however, neither TRAM-34 nor minocycline treatment reduced these levels.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that both TRAM-34 and minocycline reduce acute neuroinflammation during DKA, however, treatment with these agents for 1â€‰week after DKA does not reduce long-term neuroinflammation."
"YIU, Glenn C",Teleophthalmology Using Remote Retinal Imaging During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Introduction: Lower insurance reimbursements have limited the financial sustainability of remote eye screening programs. Greater utilization and insurance coverage for teleophthalmology screening during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 may enhance awareness and expand remote retinal imaging services. This retrospective cross-sectional study evaluates utilization and insurance coverage for remote retinal imaging in the United States in 2020. Methods: We analyzed teleretinal imaging utilization and insurance payments from January 1 to December 31, 2020, using the Optum Labs Data Warehouse, a comprehensive national database of deidentified administrative claims for commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees in the United States. We evaluated frequency of claims and insurance payment for services using the Current Procedural Terminology codes 92227 and 92228 for remote eye imaging by any provider, and 92250 for fundus photography by non-eye care providers. Results: The use of remote retinal imaging in the United States declined rapidly during the initial COVID-19 lockdown from 3,627 claims in February 2020 to 1,414 claims in April 2020, but returned to 3,133 claims by December 2020, similar to mean prepandemic levels in 2019 (2,841â€‰Â±â€‰174.8 claims). The proportion of insurance payments for remote imaging increased temporarily from 47.4% in February to 56.7% in April, and then returned to 45.9% in December of 2020. Discussion: Utilization of remote retinal imaging declined steeply, while the insurance coverage increased during the initial COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, but returned to prepandemic levels by end of the year. Changes in utilization and relaxed restrictions on insurance reimbursements for teleophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic were not sustained."
"SHIM, Ruth",The Intergenerational Impact of Structural Racism and Cumulative Trauma on Depression.,"Depression among individuals who have been racially and ethnically minoritized in the United States can be vastly different from that of non-Hispanic White Americans. For example, African American adults who have depression rate their symptoms as more severe, have a longer course of illness, and experience more depression-associated disability. The purpose of this review was to conceptualize how structural racism and cumulative trauma can be fundamental drivers of the intergenerational transmission of depression. The authors propose that understanding risk factors for depression, particularly its intergenerational reach, requires accounting for structural racism. In light of the profoundly different experiences of African Americans who experience depression (i.e., a more persistent course of illness and greater disability), it is critical to examine whether an emerging explanation for some of these differences is the intergenerational transmission of this disorder due to structural racism."

"DUBCOVSKY, Jorge",Mutations in the miRNA165/166 binding site of the HB2 gene result in pleiotropic effects on morphological traits in wheat,"Leaf, spike, stem, and root morphologies are key factors that determine crop growth, development, and productivity. Multiple genes that control these morphological traits have been identified in Arabidopsis, rice, maize, and other plant species. However, little is known about the genomic regions and genes associated with morphological traits in wheat. Here, we identified the ethyl methanesulfonate-derived mutant wheat line M133 that displays multiple morphological changes that include upward-curled leaves, paired spikelets, dwarfism, and delayed heading. Using bulked segregant RNA sequencing (BSR-seq) and a high-resolution genetic map, we identified TraesCS1D02G155200 (HB-D2) as a potential candidate gene. HB-D2 encodes a class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) transcription factor, and the mutation was located in the miRNA165/166 complementary site, resulting in a resistant allele designated rHb-D2. The relative expression of rHb2 in the mutant plants was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in plants homozygous for the WT allele. Independent resistant mutations that disrupt the miRNA165/166 complementary sites in the A- (rHb-A2) and B-genome (rHb-B2) homoeologs showed similar phenotypic alterations, but the relative intensity of the effects was different. Transgenic plants expressing rHb-D2 gene driven by the maize UBIQUITIN (UBI) promoter showed similar phenotypes to the rHb-D2 mutant. These results confirmed that HB-D2 is the causal gene responsible for the mutant phenotypes. Finally, a survey of 1397 wheat accessions showed that the complementary sites for miRNA165/166 in all three HB2 homoeologs are highly conserved. Our results suggest that HB2 plays an important role in regulating growth and development in wheat."

While in many studies both costs and effectiveness (eg, survival time) are censored, standard survival analysis techniques are often invalid due to the induced dependent censoring problem. We propose methods for censored cost-effectiveness data using the net-benefit regression framework, which allow covariate-adjustment and subgroup identification when comparing two intervention groups. The methods provide a straightforward way to construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with censored data. We also propose a more efficient doubly robust estimator of average causal incremental net benefit, which increases the likelihood that the results will represent a valid inference in observational studies. Lastly, we conduct extensive numerical studies to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed methods, and illustrate the proposed methods with a real data example using both survival time and quality-adjusted survival time as the measures of effectiveness."

"LEJEUNE, Amandine T",Inhaled recombinant human IL-15 in dogs with naturally occurring pulmonary metastases from osteosarcoma or melanoma: a phase 1 study of clinical activity and correlates of response,"PurposeAlthough recombinant human interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) has generated much excitement as an immunotherapeutic agent for cancer, activity in human clinical trials has been modest to date, in part due to the risks of toxicity with significant dose escalation. Since pulmonary metastases are a major site of distant failure in human and dog cancers, we sought to investigate inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with naturally occurring lung metastases from osteosarcoma (OSA) or melanoma. We hypothesized a favorable benefit/risk profile given the concentrated delivery to the lungs with decreased systemic exposure.Experimental designWe performed a phase I trial of inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with gross pulmonary metastases using a traditional 3+3 cohort design. A starting dose of 10 Âµg twice daily Ã— 14 days was used based on human, non-human primate, and murine studies. Safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were the primary objectives, while response rates, progression-free and overall survival (OS), and pharmacokinetic and immune correlative analyses were secondary.ResultsFrom October 2018 to December 2020, we enrolled 21 dogs with 18 dogs reaching the 28-day response assessment to be evaluable. At dose level 5 (70 Î¼g), we observed two DLTs, thereby establishing 50 Âµg twice daily Ã— 14 days as the MTD and recommended phase 2 dose. Among 18 evaluable dogs, we observed one complete response >1 year, one partial response with resolution of multiple target lesions, and five stable disease for an overall clinical benefit rate of 39%. Plasma rhIL-15 quantitation revealed detectable and sustained rhIL-15 concentrations between 1-hour and 6 hour postnebulization. Decreased pretreatment lymphocyte counts were significantly associated with clinical benefit. Cytotoxicity assays of banked peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed significant increases in peak cytotoxicity against canine melanoma and OSA targets that correlated with OS.ConclusionsIn this first-in-dog clinical trial of inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with advanced metastatic disease, we observed promising clinical activity when administered as a monotherapy for only 14 days. These data have significant clinical and biological implications for both dogs and humans with refractory lung metastases and support exploration of combinatorial therapies using inhaled rhIL-15."
"JAVIDAN, Yashar",Comparing Fusion Rates Between Fresh-Frozen and Freeze-Dried Allografts in Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion,"ObjectiveThe objective of this retrospective study is to compare the fusion rates in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery using freeze-dried versus fresh-frozen allografts.MethodsThe study comprised 79 patients. Fifty-one patients received freeze-dried allograft (106 total spinal levels) and 28 patients received fresh-frozen allograft (50 total spinal levels). Fusion was assessed through trabecular bridging on follow-up anterior-posterior/lateral radiographs. Trabecular bridging was assessed on the superior and inferior borders of each spinal level and given a fusion grade. Complete fusion is defined as >50% bridging between superior and inferior borders of the bone graft; union is complete fusion in <26 weeks; delayed union is complete fusion after 26 weeks; and fibrous union is <50% bridging at â‰¥1 borders over 52 weeks.ResultsAll spinal levels reached complete fusion for both graft types. Of the freeze-dried treated cervical spinal levels, 77.35% (82/106) reached union (adequate trabecular bridging within 6 months) without delay compared with 80% (35/50) for the fresh-frozen bone graft group (P&nbsp;= 0.85). There was no significant difference in time-to-fusion analysis and no significant association between delayed union and any patient factors. In assessing Neck Disability Index (NDI), freeze-dried allografts did show a significantly greater decrease in NDI scores at 6 months (P&nbsp;= 0.03). At the 1 year follow-up, improvements in NDI were consistent in both allografts (P&nbsp;= 0.9647).ConclusionsFrom this study, freeze-dried and fresh-frozen allografts showed comparable rates of union, and both allografts can be used interchangeably for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion."

Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a versatile technique for transient genetic studies. Here we report the implementation of foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV)-mediated gene silencing in switchgrass in above- and below-ground tissues and at different developmental stages.ResultsThe study demonstrated that leaf rub-inoculation is a suitable method for systemic gene silencing in switchgrass. For all three visual marker genes, Magnesium chelatase subunit D (ChlD) and I (ChlI) as well as phytoene desaturase (PDS), phenotypic changes were observed in leaves, albeit at different intensities. Gene silencing efficiency was verified by RT-PCR for all tested genes. Notably, systemic gene silencing was also observed in roots, although silencing efficiency was stronger in leaves (~â€‰63-94%) as compared to roots (~â€‰48-78%). Plants at a later developmental stage were moderately less amenable to VIGS than younger plants, but also less perturbed by the viral infection.ConclusionsUsing FoMV-mediated VIGS could be achieved in switchgrass leaves and roots, providing an alternative approach for studying gene functions and physiological traits in this important bioenergy crop."

While this model succeeds in capturing the asymptotic near-wall behavior of the eddy viscosity that enters the formulation of the model for the sub-grid scale correlations, its performance in these flows has proved to be unsatisfactory due to high levels of dissipation leading to poor predictions in the separated wakes. We have sought to improve the performance of this model by combining it with another, the regularized variational multiscale model, which better represents the interactions that occur in multiscale flows. This combination, which was implemented in OpenFOAM, was validated against experimental data for the challenging case of vortex shedding from circular cylinders at the high Reynolds number. Distinct improvements over the original model were obtained."
"LIU, Ruiwu",Nuclear receptor RORÎ³ inverse agonists/antagonists display tissue- and gene-context selectivity through distinct activities in altering chromatin accessibility and master regulator SREBP2 occupancy,"The nuclear receptor RORÎ³ is a major driver of autoimmune diseases and certain types of cancer due to its aberrant function in T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation and tumor cholesterol metabolism, respectively. Compound screening using the classic receptor-coactivator interaction perturbation scheme led to identification of many small-molecule modulators of RORÎ³(t). We report here that inverse agonists/antagonists of RORÎ³ such as VTP-43742 derivative VTP-23 and TAK828F, which can potently inhibit the inflammatory gene program in Th17 cells, unexpectedly lack high potency in inhibiting the growth of TNBC tumor cells. In contrast, antagonists such as XY018 and GSK805 that strongly suppress tumor cell growth and survival display only modest activities in reducing Th17-related cytokine expression. Unexpectedly, we found that VTP-23 significantly induces the cholesterol biosynthesis program in TNBC cells. Our further mechanistic analyses revealed that VTP-23 enhances the local chromatin accessibility, H3K27ac mark and the cholesterol master regulator SREBP2 recruitment at the RORÎ³ binding sites, whereas XY018 exerts the opposite activities. Yet, they display similar inhibitory effects on circadian rhythm program. Similar distinctions and contrasting activities between TAK828F and SR2211 in their effects on local chromatin structure at Il17 genes were also observed. Together, our study shows for the first-time that structurally distinct RORÎ³ antagonists possess different or even contrasting activities in tissue/cell-specific manner. Our findings also highlight that the activities at natural chromatin are key determinants of RORÎ³ modulators' tissue selectivity."

Although both molecular and antigen testing have clearly defined uses, the utility of serology remains uncertain and is presently not recommended for assessing immunity.MethodsWe conducted a pragmatic, observational study evaluating four commercially available emergency use authorized laboratory-based COVID-19 serology assays (Assays A-D). Remnant samples from hospitalized, and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients, as well as vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were collected and tested. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated. Antibody concentrations were compared across the platforms and populations.ResultsA total of 588 remnant samples derived from 500 patients were tested. PPA at 5-12 weeks post-PCR positive results for Assays A-D was 98.3, 97.4, 99.2, and 95.8% respectively. NPA was 100% across all platforms. Mean antibody concentrations at 2-4 weeks post-PCR positive result were significantly higher in hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients, respectively, for Assay A (131.8 [101.7] vs. 95.6 [100.3] AU/mL, P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001), B (61.7 [62.4] vs. 38.1 [40.5] AU/mL, P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001), and C (157.6 [105.3] vs. 133.3 [100.7] AU/mL, P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001). For individuals receiving two vaccine doses mean antibody concentrations were respectively 169.6 (104.4), 27.3 (50.8), 189.6 (120.9), 21.19 (13.1) AU/mL for Assays A-D.ConclusionsOverall, PPA and NPA differed across the four assays.

"PARIKH, Atul N",Surfactant-Mediated Solubilization of Myelin Figures: A Multistep Morphological Cascade,"Lamellar mesophases of insoluble lipids are readily solubilized by the micellar mesophases of soluble surfactants. This simple process underscores a broad array of biochemical methodologies, including purification, reconstitution, and crystallization of membrane proteins, as well as the isolation of detergent-resistant membrane fractions. Although much is now known about the thermodynamic driving forces of membrane solubilization, the kinetic pathways by which the surfactant alters vesicular mesophases are only beginning to be appreciated. Little is known about how these interactions affect the solubilization of more complex, multilamellar mesophases. Here, we investigate how a common zwitterionic detergent affects the solubilization of a smectic, multilamellar, cylindrical mesophase of lipids, called the myelin figure. Our results reveal that myelin solubilization occurs in a multistep manner, producing a well-defined sequence of morphologically distinct intermediates en route to complete solubilization. The kinetic processes producing these intermediates include (1) coiling, which encompasses the formation, propagation, and tightening of extended helices; (2) thinning, which reflects the unbinding of lamellae in the smectic stacks; and (3) detachment or retraction, which either dissociates the myelinic protrusion from the source lipid mass or returns the myelinic protrusion to the source lipid massâ”€all in transit toward complete solubilization. These occasionally overlapping steps are most pronounced in single-lipid component myelins, while compositionally graded multicomponent myelins inhibit the coiling step and detach more frequently. Taken together, the appearance of these intermediates during the solubilization of myelins suggests a complex free-energy landscape characterizing myelin solubilization populated by metastable, morphological intermediates correlated with locally minimized changes in energy dependent upon the mesophase's composition. This then predicts the accessibility of structurally distinct, kinetic intermediatesâ”€such as loose and tight coiled helices, peeled myelins, retracted tubes, and detached protrusionsâ”€before reaching the stable ground state corresponding to a dissolved suspension of mixed surfactant-lipid micelles."

Several genes known to have such functions were identified and experimentally validated, including 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase, coenzyme A (CoA) disulfide reductase, and certain hydrolases. Furthermore, we discovered that an enigmatic YqeK hydrolase domain fused to NadD has a novel proofreading function in NAD synthesis and could double as a MutT-like sanitizing enzyme for the nucleotide pool. Finally, we combined metabolomics and cheminformatics approaches to extend the core metabolic map of JCVI-Syn3A to include promiscuous enzymatic reactions and spontaneous side reactions. This extension revealed that several key metabolite damage control systems remain to be identified in JCVI-Syn3A, such as that for methylglyoxal. IMPORTANCE Metabolite damage and repair mechanisms are being increasingly recognized. We present here compelling genetic and biochemical evidence for the universal importance of these mechanisms by demonstrating that stripping a genome down to its barest essentials leaves metabolite damage control systems in place. Furthermore, our metabolomic and cheminformatic results point to the existence of a network of metabolite damage and damage control reactions that extends far beyond the corners of it that have been characterized so far. In sum, there can be little room left to doubt that metabolite damage and the systems that counter it are mainstream metabolic processes that cannot be separated from life itself."
"NARDO, Lorenzo",Pericardial computed tomography imaging findings in the setting of coccidioidomycosis.,"BackgroundPericardial disease can be a manifestation of infection and imaging can have a role in its diagnosis. coccidioidomycosis endemic fungal infection has been more frequently reported over the past few decades. Other than case reports or series, there has been no systemic study evaluating pericardial imaging findings in patients with coccidioidomycosis to the best of our knowledge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate intrathoracic computed tomographic (CT) imaging abnormalities in patients with coccidioidal infection with specific emphasis on the pericardium.MethodsRetrospective review of radiology reports and clinical chart review was performed to identify patients with coccidioidomycosis between January 2000 and September 2021 at our medical center. Diagnosis of infection was confirmed predominately with serology. Patients were excluded if a CT was not performed within 3&nbsp;months of confirmed diagnosis date and if there was concomitant additional granulomatous or fungal infection. Chest CT was reviewed for pericardial and additional intrathoracic findings.ResultsThe final retrospective cohort consisted of 37 patients. Imaging findings included lung nodules (Nâ€‰=â€‰33/37), consolidation (Nâ€‰=â€‰25/37), mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy (Nâ€‰=â€‰20/37) and pleural effusions (Nâ€‰=â€‰13/37). Eleven of 37 patients (30%) had either trace pericardial fluid (Nâ€‰=â€‰3/37) or small pericardial effusions (Nâ€‰=â€‰8/37). One patient had pericardial enhancement/thickening and history of pericardial tamponade. No other patient had clinical pericarditis or pericardial tamponade. Pericardial calcifications were not seen in any patient. Pericardial effusion was statistically associated with presence of pleural effusion as 9/13 patients with pleural effusion had pericardial effusion versus 2/26 patients without pleural effusion had pericardial effusion (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Otherwise patients with and without pericardial imaging findings were similar in terms of demographics, comorbidities and other imaging findings.ConclusionPulmonary parenchymal pathology is a common manifestation of coccidioidal infection. Most patients with coccidioidomycosis do not have pericardial imaging abnormalities on CT."

This is critical as digital health technologies present technical, governance, and legal challenges which are unique to the surgeon and surgical patient. We aim to define the term digital surgery and the ethical issues surrounding its clinical application, and to identify barriers and research goals for future practice. 38 international experts, across the fields of surgery, AI, industry, law, ethics and policy, participated in a four-round Delphi exercise. Issues were generated by an expert panel and public panel through a scoping questionnaire around key themes identified from the literature and voted upon in two subsequent questionnaire rounds. Consensus was defined if >70% of the panel deemed the statement important and <30% unimportant. A final online meeting was held to discuss consensus statements. The definition of digital surgery as the use of technology for the enhancement of preoperative planning, surgical performance, therapeutic support, or training, to improve outcomes and reduce harm achieved 100% consensus agreement. We highlight key ethical issues concerning data, privacy, confidentiality and public trust, consent, law, litigation and liability, and commercial partnerships within digital surgery and identify barriers and research goals for future practice. Developers and users of digital surgery must not only have an awareness of the ethical issues surrounding digital applications in healthcare, but also the ethical considerations unique to digital surgery. Future research into these issues must involve all digital surgery stakeholders including patients."

In earlier observational studies conducted in 2014-2015, we identified several key underlying problems with the potential to impact stunting in Sumedang district, West Java, Indonesia. Deficits in intakes of growth-limiting micronutrients were observed, most notably calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamin A, emphasizing the need for a food-based intervention to overcome these micronutrient deficits in the diets of mothers and their infants. Methods: A double-blind placebo-controlled cluster randomised trial comparing the effect of daily consumption of&nbsp;75 grams of locally produced micronutrient-enriched crackers (MEC)&nbsp;(intervention group) compared to placebo crackers (control group) by mothers at two-time intervals: (i) from the 8-14 weeks of pregnancy to delivery (i.e., 28-34 weeks of consumption of MEC) on birth length, and (ii) from the 8-14 weeks of pregnancy to 5 months post-partum on attained linear growth and linear growth velocity of breast-fed infants. A total of 324 pregnant women from 28 clusters (villages) located in 3 sub-districts in Sumedang district, West Java, Indonesia, will be randomly assigned to either intervention (n=14 villages) or control (n=14 villages).

A two-part multilevel model is a special case of a multilevel model developed for semi-continuous data, such as data that include a combination of zeros and continuous values. For repeated measures of media use data, a two-part multilevel model informs market research about consumer-specific likeliness to use media, level of use across time, and variation in use over time. These models are typically estimated using maximum likelihood. There are, however, tremendous advantages to using a Bayesian framework, including the ease at which the analyst can take into account information learned from previous investigations. This paper develops a Bayesian approach to estimating a two-part multilevel model and illustrates its use by applying the model to daily diary measures of television use in a large US sample."

"FIEHN, Oliver",Lipidomic profiling in the Strong Heart Study identified American Indians at risk of chronic kidney disease.,"Dyslipidemia associates with and usually precedes the onset of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but a comprehensive assessment of molecular lipid species associated with risk of CKD is lacking. Here, we sought to identify fasting plasma lipids associated with risk of CKD among American Indians in the Strong Heart Family Study, a large-scale community-dwelling of individuals, followed by replication in Mexican Americans from the San Antonio Family Heart Study and Caucasians from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study. We also performed repeated measurement analysis to examine the temporal relationship between the change in the lipidome and change in kidney function between baseline and follow-up of about five years apart. Network analysis was conducted to identify differential lipid classes associated with risk of CKD. In the discovery cohort, we found that higher baseline level of multiple lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids and sphingolipids, was significantly associated with increased risk of CKD, independent of age, sex, body mass index, diabetes and hypertension. Many lipid species were replicated in at least one external cohort at the individual lipid species and/or the class level. Longitudinal change in the plasma lipidome was significantly associated with change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate after adjusting for covariates, baseline lipids and the baseline rate. Network analysis identified distinct lipidomic signatures differentiating high from low-risk groups. Thus, our results demonstrated that disturbed lipid metabolism precedes the onset of CKD. These findings shed light on the mechanisms linking dyslipidemia to CKD and provide potential novel biomarkers for identifying individuals with early impaired kidney function at preclinical stages."
"ELLIS, Matt",Economic Model Predictive Control of Transport-Reaction Processes,"Transport-reaction processes, which are typically described by parabolic or hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), play an important role within the chemical process industries. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop feedback control techniques that operate transport-reaction processes in an economically optimal fashion in the presence of constraints in the process states and manipulated inputs. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) is a predictive control scheme that combines process economics and feedback control into an integrated framework with the potential of improving the closed-loop process economic performance compared to traditional control methodologies. In this work, we address two key issues in applying EMPC to transport-reaction processes. First, we focus on a system of nonlinear parabolic PDEs and propose a novel EMPC design integrating adaptive proper orthogonal decomposition (APOD) method with a high-order finite-difference method to handle state constraints. The computational efficiency and constraint handling properties of this scheme are evaluated using a tubular reactor example modeled by two nonlinear parabolic PDEs. Second, we formulate an EMPC system that accounts for both manipulated input and state constraints for a system of first-order hyperbolic PDEs. Various closed-loop simulation scenarios are presented to demonstrate the overall effectiveness of this EMPC scheme using a plug flow reactor example."

"ELLIS, Matt",Dynamic modeling and input shaping for MEMS,"One of the common characteristics of Silicon MEMS actuators is that they operate in open-loop, due to difficulties and cost of integrating sensors at small scales. A proper dynamic response (trajectory following, vibration suppression, etc.) is difficult to obtain using open-loop control, as it is much better suited for quasistatic device operation. As a result, the dynamic performance of MEMS devices in many applications is not fully achieved. In this paper we propose to use input-shaping techniques along with an identified reduced-order model to generate suitable input profiles for MEMS actuators. This systematic approach is a major improvement over the current Finite Element/Design of Experiments practices in the MEMS community."
"KIURU, Maija H","Melanoma in women of childbearing age and in pregnancy in California, 1994â€“2015: a populationâ€based cohort study","BackgroundMelanoma is one of the most common malignancies during pregnancy. There is debate regarding the impact of pregnancy on the prognosis of melanoma. Recent large population-based studies from the United States are lacking.ObjectivesTo determine the characteristics and survival of women with pregnancy-associated melanoma.MethodsThis population-based, retrospective cohort study used California Cancer Registry data linked with state-wide hospitalization and ambulatory surgery data to identify 15-44-year-old female patients diagnosed with melanoma in 1994-2015, including pregnant patients. Multivariable logistic regression compared demographic and clinical characteristics between pregnant and non-pregnant women with melanoma. Multivariable cox proportional hazards regression models assessed melanoma-specific and overall survival.ResultsWe identified 13â€‰108 patients, of which 1406 were pregnant. Pregnancy-associated melanoma was more frequent in Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic White women. Melanoma occurring post-partum was associated with greater tumour thickness (2.01-4.00 vs. 0.01-1.00â€‰mm, odds ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-2.98). There were otherwise no significant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women. Worse survival was associated with Asian, Black and Native American race/ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic White), lower neighbourhood socio-economic status, public insurance, tumour site, greater tumour thickness and lymph node involvement, but not pregnancy.ConclusionsMelanoma occurring post-partum was associated with greater tumour thickness, but pregnancy status did not affect survival after melanoma. Race/ethnicity, socio-economic status and health insurance impacted survival, emphasizing the importance of reducing health disparities."

"LI, Ronald H",Platelet Priming and Activation in Naturally Occurring Thermal Burn Injuries and Wildfire Smoke Exposure Is Associated With Intracardiac Thrombosis and Spontaneous Echocardiographic Contrast in Feline Survivors,"Wildfires pose a major health risk for humans, wildlife, and domestic animals. We previously discovered pathophysiologic parallels between domestic cats with naturally occurring smoke inhalation and thermal burn injuries and human beings with similar injuries; these were characterized by transient myocardial thickening, cardiac troponin I elevation and formation of intracardiac thrombosis. While the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, results from murine models suggest that platelet priming and activation may contribute to a global hypercoagulable state and thrombosis. Herein, we evaluated and compared the degree of platelet activation, platelet response to physiologic agonists and levels of platelet-derived microvesicles (PDMV) in 29 cats with naturally occurring wildfire thermal injuries (WF), 21 clinically healthy cats with subclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 11 healthy cats without HCM (CC). We also quantified and compared circulating PDMVs in WF cats to CC cats. In addition, we examined the association between thrombotic events, severity of burn injuries, myocardial changes, and the degree of platelet activation in cats exposed to wildfires. Flow cytometric detection of platelet surface P-selectin expression showed that WF cats had increased platelet response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thrombin compared to the two control groups indicating the presence of primed platelets in circulation. In addition, cats in the WF group had increased circulating levels of PDMV, characterized by increased phosphatidylserine on the external leaflet. Cats in the WF group with documented intracardiac thrombosis had elevated platelet activation and platelet priming in the presence of ADP. While high dose arachidonic acid (AA) mostly resulted in platelet inhibition, persistent response to AA was noted among cats in the WF group with intracardiac thrombosis. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses demonstrated that increased platelet response to AA was independently associated with thrombotic events. This is the first study reporting the significant association between platelet priming and intracardiac thrombosis in domestic cats with naturally occurring wildfire-related injuries and smoke inhalation. Further studies are required to delineate additional mechanisms between inflammation and thrombosis, especially regarding platelet primers and the cyclooxygenase pathway.One sentence summaryPlatelet activation and shedding of platelet-derived microvesicles due to platelet priming is present following naturally occurring wildfire smoke exposure and thermal burn injuries in a population of domestic cats."

Unfortunately, PCR-based testing has limitations and may not result in a positive test early in the course of infection before symptoms develop. Enveloped RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, alter peripheral blood methylation and DNA methylation signatures may characterize asymptomatic versus symptomatic infection. We used Illumina's Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array to profile peripheral blood samples from 164 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, of whom 8 had no symptoms. Epigenome-wide association analysis identified 10 methylation sites associated with infection and a quantile-quantile plot showed little inflation. These preliminary results suggest that differences in methylation patterns may distinguish asymptomatic from symptomatic infection."
"GEORGE, Kristen M",Sex-specific effects of microglial activation on Alzheimerâ€™s disease proteinopathy in older adults,"Females show a disproportionate burden of Alzheimer's disease pathology and higher Alzheimer's disease dementia prevalences compared to males, yet the mechanisms driving these vulnerabilities are unknown. There is sexual dimorphism in immunological functioning, and neuroimmune processes are implicated in Alzheimer's disease genesis. Using neuropathology indicators from human brain tissue, we examined the mediational role of microglial activation on the relationship between amyloid and tau and how it differs by sex. 187 decedents (64% female; 89 mean age at death; 62% non-demented) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project completed neuropathological evaluations with brain tissue quantified for microglial activation, amyloid-Î² and tau. Proportion of morphologically activated microglia was determined via immunohistochemistry (HLA-DP-DQ-DR) and morphological staging (stage I, II or III). Amyloid-Î² and tau burden were quantified via immunohistochemistry (M00872 or AT8, respectively). Using causal counterfactual modelling, we estimated the mediational effect of microglial activation on the amyloid-Î² to tau relationship in the whole sample and stratified by sex (amyloid-Î² â†’ microglial activation â†’ tau). Alternative models tested the role of microglia activation as the precipitating event (microglial activation â†’ amyloid-Î² â†’ tau). Microglial activation significantly mediated 33% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10-67] of the relationship between amyloid-Î² and tau in the whole sample; stratified analyses suggested this effect was stronger and only statistically significant in females. 57% (95% CI 22-100) of the effect of amyloid-Î² on tau was mediated through microglial activation in females, compared to 19% (95% CI 0-64) in males. Regional analyses suggested that mediational effects were driven by greater cortical versus subcortical microglial activation. Relationships were independent of cerebrovascular disease indices. Alternative models suggested that in females, microglial activation was a significant exposure both preceding the amyloid-Î² to tau relationship (mediational effect: 50%, 95% CI 23-90) and directly related to tau burden (microglia direct effect: 50%, 95% CI 10-77). By contrast, in males, only the direct effect of microglial activation to tau reached significance (74%, 95% CI 32-100) (mediational effect: 26%, 95% CI 0-68). Our models suggest a reciprocal, bidirectional relationship between amyloid-Î² and microglial activation that significantly accounts for tau burden in females. By contrast, in males, direct independent (non-mediational) relationships between microglial activation or amyloid-Î² with tau were observed. Microglial activation may be disproportionately important for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis in females. Determining sex-specific vulnerabilities to Alzheimer's disease development both inform fundamental pathophysiology and support precision health approaches for this heterogeneous disease."

We assessed marital relationship satisfaction, parent neuroticism, and child effortful control through the use of validated questionnaires. We used univariate comparisons and multivariable models to determine whether marital relationship satisfaction was associated with hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] and whether this association persisted after adjusting for demographic factors and parent neuroticism/child effortful control.ResultsIn univariate analyses, HbA1c was associated with marital relationship satisfaction of the primary caregiver. In multivariable models adjusting for demographic factors, marital satisfaction remained associated with HbA1c, whereas none of the other factors tested (including family income and race/ethnicity) retained significance. In univariate analyses, child effortful control was also associated with HbA1c. When child effortful control was added to the multivariable model, marital satisfaction remained associated with HbA1c with similar coefficient and confidence intervals describing the relationship between marital satisfaction and hemoglobin A1c.ConclusionsHigher levels of marital satisfaction of the primary diabetes caregiver are associated with glycemic outcomes for children with type 1 diabetes. Interventions to improve spousal relationships may have downstream benefits that could include promoting more optimal child HbA1c levels."

A randomized clinal trial was completed on eight California dairy herds to estimate the effects of different dry cow therapies (AB, TS, AB + TS or None) on clinical mastitis and culling. A total of 1273 cows were randomized to one of the four treatment groups over summer and winter seasons. For each enrolled cow, microbiological testing was done on quarter milk samples collected from the first detection of clinical mastitis within the first 150 days in milk (DIM) in the subsequent lactation. Statistical analysis was done using generalized linear mixed models. There were no significant differences in the odds of clinical mastitis or culling between cows treated with AB, TS, or AB + TS compared to the controls. Dry cow therapy with AB and/or TS had no statistically significant effect on clinical mastitis and cow culling during the first 150 DIM."

The objectives of this study were to describe the use of a novel drug-eluting embolic microsphere containing paclitaxel for use during transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), to compare results of liver-specific owner questionnaires and tumor volume pre- and post-TACE, and to measure systemic paclitaxel concentration post-TACE. Client-owned dogs with non-resectable hepatic neoplasia were prospectively enrolled. All owners completed questionnaires validated for the assessment of subjective outcomes in dogs with cancer before the TACE procedure and approximately 4 weeks after the TACE procedure. A CT scan was performed before TACE and 1 month after TACE; results were compared. Blood samples were obtained at specified time points post-TACE to determine systemic paclitaxel concentrations. Seven dogs (median weight: 8.9 kg; range, 4.3-31 kg) were enrolled. TACE was successfully performed in all dogs, and no intra-procedural complications were encountered. Questionnaire scores improved significantly post-TACE. Among the 6 dogs for which full data were available, median pre-TACE tumor volume was 390 cc (range 152-1,484; interquartile range 231-1,139) and median post-TACE tumor volume was 203 cc (range 98-889; interquartile range 151-369), which was significantly (P = .028) lower. All 6 dogs had a reduction in volume at the post-TACE measurement. Mean percent change in tumor volume was -45.6% (95%CI -58.6 to -32.6%). The mean plasma paclitaxel concentration in canine blood peaked at 4 days post-TACE procedure and was 25.7 ng/mL (range = 3.09-110 ng/mL) Median survival time was 629 days (95%CI 18 to upper limit not reached). The use of a novel paclitaxel-eluting microsphere in this cohort of dogs successfully decreased tumor volume significantly after TACE and improved clinical signs. Future investigation into the use of TACE and other similar therapies is warranted due to the promising outcomes noted in this cohort."

Strangulating intestinal obstruction impairs the gastrointestinal outflow and can lead to secondary gastric rupture and endotoxemia. Clostridioides difficile can cause enterotyphlocolitis with colic in horses of all ages, and the process is commonly referred to as C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD). Here we report the results of the postmortem examination of a 7-y-old Thoroughbred racehorse with concurrent CDAD, EFE, and gastric rupture that was euthanized following a history of colic over several days. A segment of distal jejunum and proximal ileum had passed through the epiploic foramen, and the intestinal wall was thickened and dark-red. The remaining small intestinal loops were distended and filled with blood-tinged contents. Peritonitis had resulted from escape of gastric contents into the abdominal cavity through a tear in the major curvature of the stomach. Histologically, the incarcerated segment had acute transmural hemorrhage with congestion and mucosal necrosis; neutrophilic infiltrates with fibrin thrombi were in the mucosa of the non-incarcerated small intestinal segments. C. difficile toxins were detected in the small intestinal contents, and C. difficile was isolated from the small intestine, colon, and cecum."

With the large volume of lutetium-based scintillation crystals that are used as detector elements in these scanners, there is an increased flux of background radiation originating from 176Lu decay in the crystals and higher sensitivity for detecting it. Combined with the ability of scanning the entire body in a single bed position, this allows more effective utilization of the lutetium background as a transmission source for estimating 511 keV attenuation coefficients. In this study, utilization of the lutetium background radiation for attenuation correction in total-body PET was studied using Monte Carlo simulations of a 3D whole-body XCAT phantom in the uEXPLORER PET scanner, with particular focus on ultralow-dose PET scans that are now made possible with these scanners. Effects of an increased acceptance angle, reduced scan durations, and Compton scattering on PET quantification were studied. Furthermore, quantification accuracy of lutetium-based attenuation correction was compared for a 20-min scan of the whole body on the uEXPLORER, a one-meter-long, and a conventional 24-cm-long scanner. Quantification and lesion contrast were minimally affected in both long axial field-of-view scanners and in a whole-body 20-min scan, the mean bias in all analyzed organs of interest were within a Â±10% range compared to ground-truth activity maps. Quantification was affected in certain organs, when scan duration was reduced to 5 min or a reduced acceptance angle of 17Â° was used. Analysis of the Compton scattered events suggests that implementing a scatter correction method for the transmission data will be required, and increasing the energy threshold from 250 keV to 290 keV can reduce the computational costs and data rates, with negligible effects on PET quantification. Finally, the current results can serve as groundwork for transferring lutetium-based attenuation correction into research and clinical practice."
"RONALD, Pamela C",Transgenic expression of the rice Xa21 patternâ€recognition receptor in banana (Musa sp.) confers resistance to Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum,"Banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW), caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm), is the most devastating disease of banana in east and central Africa. The spread of BXW threatens the livelihood of millions of African farmers who depend on banana for food security and income. There are no commercial chemicals, biocontrol agents or resistant cultivars available to control BXW. Here, we take advantage of the robust resistance conferred by the rice pattern-recognition receptor (PRR), XA21, to the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). We identified a set of genes required for activation of Xa21-mediated immunity (rax) that were conserved in both Xoo and Xcm. Based on the conservation, we hypothesized that intergeneric transfer of Xa21 would confer resistance to Xcm. We evaluated 25 transgenic lines of the banana cultivar 'Gonja manjaya' (AAB) using a rapid bioassay and 12 transgenic lines in the glasshouse for resistance against Xcm. About 50% of the transgenic lines showed complete resistance to Xcm in both assays. In contrast, all of the nontransgenic control plants showed severe symptoms that progressed to complete wilting. These results indicate that the constitutive expression of the rice Xa21 gene in banana results in enhanced resistance against Xcm. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the feasibility of PRR gene transfer between monocotyledonous species and provides a valuable new tool for controlling the BXW pandemic of banana, a staple food for 100&nbsp;million people in east Africa."

Accumulating evidence attests to the important roles of the immune system in OA pathogenesis. Understanding the role of various immune cells in joint degeneration or joint repair after injury is vital for improving therapeutic strategies for treating OA. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) develops in ~50% of individuals who have experienced an articular trauma like an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Here, using the high resolution of single-cell RNA sequencing, we delineated the temporal dynamics of immune cell accumulation in the mouse knee joint after ACL rupture. Our study identified multiple immune cell types in the joint including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, B cells, T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells. Monocytes and macrophage populations showed the most dramatic changes after injury. Further characterization of monocytes and macrophages reveled 9 major subtypes with unique transcriptomics signatures, including a tissue resident Lyve1hiFolr2hi macrophage population and Trem2hiFcrls+ recruited macrophages, both showing enrichment for phagocytic genes and growth factors such as Igf1, Pdgfa and Pdgfc. We also identified several genes induced or repressed after ACL injury in a cell type-specific manner. This study provides new insight into PTOA-associated changes in the immune microenvironment and highlights macrophage subtypes that may play a role in joint repair after injury."

However, the mechanisms by which maternal adiposity influences fetal developmental programming remain to be elucidated. We aimed to understand the impact of maternal obesity on the metabolism of both pregnant mothers and their offspring, as well as on metabolic, brain, and behavioral development of offspring by utilizing metabolomics, protein, and behavioral assays in a non-human primate model. We found that maternal obesity was associated with elevated inflammation and significant alterations in metabolites of energy metabolism and one-carbon metabolism in maternal plasma and urine, as well as in the placenta. Infants that were born to obese mothers were significantly larger at birth compared to those that were born to lean mothers. Additionally, they exhibited significantly reduced novelty preference and significant alterations in their emotional response to stress situations. These changes coincided with differences in the phosphorylation of enzymes in the brain mTOR signaling pathway between infants that were born to obese and lean mothers and correlated with the concentration of maternal plasma betaine during pregnancy. In summary, gestational obesity significantly impacted the infant systemic and brain metabolome and adaptive behaviors."

""Union,"" ""delayed union,"" ""non-union"" and ""mal-union"" were defined, and fracture, demographic, treatment, and outcome variables described. Differences in proportions or medians between ""union,"" ""delayed union"" and ""non-union"" were tested using Ï‡2 and Mann-Whitney U-tests for categorical and continuous variables respectively. Potential explanatory variables for ""delayed or non-union"" were tested using logistic regression to identify risk factors.ResultsMedian radiographic follow up was 53â€‰days (14-282). Delayed union occurred in 13.9% of fractures (64/461), non-union in 4.6% (21/461), and mal-union in 0.7% (3/461). Risk factors for delayed or non-union were age (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.12-1.31); comminuted fracture (OR 4.24, 95% CI 2.4-7.5); treatment with bone graft (all types) (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.3-8.5); surgical site infection (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.17-8.97), and major implant failure (OR 12.94, 95% CI 5.06-33.1).ConclusionOlder dogs, dogs with comminuted fractures, surgical site infection, or major implant failure were at increased odds of delayed or non-union. Radius and ulna fractures in toy breed dogs were not at increased odds of delayed or non-union.Clinical significanceThe identified risk factors should inform fracture planning and prognosticating. The prognosis for radial fractures in toy breeds appears better than historically believed."

"CORSI, Rich",Assessing indoor air toxicity with condensate collected from air using the mitochondrial activity of human BJ fibroblasts and THP-1 monocytes,"The hypothesis for our study was that air and airborne moisture are carriers of possible toxic compounds and these compounds can be collected as condensate using dry ice. Using human cells, we aimed to evaluate the indoor air toxic risk from the condensed water collected from several office and laboratory rooms in two different buildings, both located at the University of Texas at Austin. Condensate samples were collected by using stainless steel collectors (E-collectors), and the effects of samples on the viability of human BJ fibroblast and activated THP-1-monocytes in vitro were investigated by using WST-1 cytotoxicity assays. Toxicological assessment utilizing human BJ fibroblasts and activated THP-1-monocytes of condensate from air reflects the acute toxic effects of the indoor air. The first results suggest that toxicological assessment of condensate collected from air using dry ice in stainless steel condensate collectors and human BJ fibroblasts and activated THP-1-monocytes as test organisms could be useful in detecting indoor air anomalies."

Such comparisons, however, are potentially confounded by two key effects: different brew temperatures necessarily change the extraction dynamics and potentially alter the resulting brew strength, and different consumption temperatures are well known to affect perceived flavor and taste. Here, we performed a systematic study of how extraction temperature affects the sensory qualities of full immersion coffee. The investigation used a 3 Ã— 3 Ã— 3 factorial design, with coffee from three different origins representing different post-harvest methods (washed, honey-processed, and wet-hulled), each roasted to three different levels (light, medium, and dark), and each brewed at three different temperatures (4 Â°C, 22 Â°C, and 92 Â°C). All coffees were brewed to equilibrium, then diluted to precisely 2% total dissolved solids (TDS) and served at the same cold temperature (4 Â°C). We find that four attributes exhibited statistically significant variations with brew temperature for all origins and roast levels tested, with bitter taste, sour taste, and rubber flavor all higher in hot brewed coffees, and floral flavor higher in cold brewed coffee. However, there were strong interactions with origin and roast, with several additional attributes significantly impacted by temperature for specific origins and roast levels. These results provide insight on how brew temperature can be used to modulate the flavor profile of full immersion coffee."
"TANTILLO, Dean J",Comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics reveal specialized metabolite drought stress responses in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum),"Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a bioenergy model crop valued for its energy efficiency and drought tolerance. The related monocot species rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays) deploy species-specific, specialized metabolites as core stress defenses. By contrast, specialized chemical defenses in switchgrass are largely unknown. To investigate specialized metabolic drought responses in switchgrass, we integrated tissue-specific transcriptome and metabolite analyses of the genotypes Alamo and Cave-in-Rock that feature different drought tolerance. The more drought-susceptible Cave-in-Rock featured an earlier onset of transcriptomic changes and significantly more differentially expressed genes in response to drought compared to Alamo. Specialized pathways showed moderate differential expression compared to pronounced transcriptomic alterations in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. However, diterpenoid-biosynthetic genes showed drought-inducible expression in Alamo roots, contrasting largely unaltered triterpenoid and phenylpropanoid pathways. Metabolomic analyses identified common and genotype-specific flavonoids and terpenoids. Consistent with transcriptomic alterations, several root diterpenoids showed significant drought-induced accumulation, whereas triterpenoid abundance remained predominantly unchanged. Structural analysis verified select drought-responsive diterpenoids as oxygenated furanoditerpenoids. Drought-dependent transcriptome and metabolite profiles provide the foundation to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying switchgrass drought responses. Accumulation of specialized root diterpenoids and corresponding pathway transcripts supports a role in drought stress tolerance."

Having high BPE has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. We examined the relationship between BPE and the amount of fibroglandular tissue on MRI (MRI-FGT) and breast cancer risk factors. This was a cross-sectional study of 415 women without breast cancer undergoing contrast-enhanced breast MRI at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. All women completed a questionnaire assessing exposures at the time of MRI. Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) describing the relationship between breast cancer risk factors and BPE and MRI-FGT were generated using modified Poisson regression. In multivariable-adjusted models a positive association between body mass index (BMI) and BPE was observed, with a 5-unit increase in BMI associated with a 14% and 44% increase in prevalence of high BPE in pre- and post-menopausal women, respectively. Conversely, a strong inverse relationship between BMI and MRI-FGT was observed in both pre- (PRâ€‰=â€‰0.66, 95% CI 0.57, 0.76) and post-menopausal (PRâ€‰=â€‰0.66, 95% CI 0.56, 0.78) women. Use of preventive medication (e.g., tamoxifen) was associated with having low BPE, while no association was observed for MRI-FGT. BPE is an imaging marker available from standard contrast-enhanced MRI, that is influenced by endogenous and exogenous hormonal exposures in both pre- and post-menopausal women."

To date, most existing research on adult plasticity has focused on how exteroceptive sensorimotor networks compensate for damage to preserve function. Interoceptive networks-those that represent and process sensory information about the body's internal state-are now recognized to be critical for a wide range of physiological and psychological functions from basic energy regulation to maintaining a sense of self, but the extent to which these networks remain plastic in adulthood has not been established. In this report, we used detailed histological analyses to pinpoint precise changes to gray matter volume in the interoceptive-allostatic network in adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) who received neurotoxic lesions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and neurologically intact control monkeys. Relative to controls, monkeys with ACC lesions had significant and selective unilateral expansion of the ventral anterior insula and significant relative bilateral expansion of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. This work demonstrates the capacity for neuroplasticity in the interoceptive-allostatic network which, given that changes included expansion rather than atrophy, is likely to represent an adaptive response following damage."

The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of drying bed thickness on drying characteristics and quality of rough rice under IR heating. The samples of freshly harvested medium grain rice (M202 variety) with 20.5 % and 23.8% (wb) moisture contents were used for this study. They were dried with two different radiation intensities, 4685 and 5348 W/m 2, for six exposure times, 15, 30, 40, 60, 90 and 120 s, for each drying bed thickness. The tested three drying bed thicknesses were single layer, 5 mm and 10 mm. After IR drying, the samples were tempered for 4 hours followed by slow cooling. The drying rate, moisture removal and temperature of rice during drying were measured and calculated. The rice temperatures after the IR heating were in the range of 35.9 to 71.4 Â°C. The heating and drying rates decreased with the increase of bed thickness. A significant amount of moisture was removed during slow cooling after tempering, without additional energy input. The quality of milled rice, including total rice yield, head rice yield, and degree of milling of the dried rice was evaluated. It was concluded that a high heating rate, fast drying and good rice quality could be achieved by heating rough rice to about 60 Â°C followed by tempering and slow cooling with a bed thickness up to 10 mm."

"AMES, James B",NMR Structures of Calmodulin Bound to Two Separate Regulatory Sites in the Retinal Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channel,"Retinal cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels (composed of three CNGA1 and one CNGB1 subunits) exhibit a Ca2+-induced reduction in channel open probability mediated by calmodulin (CaM). Defects in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of CNG channels may be linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and other inherited forms of blindness. Here, we report the NMR structure and binding analysis of CaM bound to two separate sites within CNGB1 (CaM1: residues 565-589 and CaM2: residues 1120-1147). Our binding studies reveal that CaM1 binds to the Ca2+-bound CaM N-lobe with at least fivefold higher affinity than it binds to the CaM C-lobe. By contrast, the CaM2 site binds to the Ca2+-bound CaM C-lobe with higher affinity than it binds to the N-lobe. CaM1 and CaM2 both exhibited very weak binding to Ca2+-free CaM. We present separate NMR structures of Ca2+-saturated CaM bound to CaM1 and CaM2 that define key intermolecular contacts: CaM1 residue F575 interacts with the CaM N-lobe while CaM2 residues L1129, L1132, and L1136 each make close contact with the CaM C-lobe. The CNGB1 mutation F575E abolishes CaM1 binding to the CaM N-lobe while L1132E and L1136E each abolish CaM2 binding to the CaM C-lobe. Thus, a single CaM can bind to both sites in CNGB1 in which the CaM N-lobe binds to CaM1 and the CaM C-lobe binds to CaM2. We propose a Ca2+-dependent conformational switch in the CNG channel caused by CaM binding, which may serve to attenuate cGMP binding to CNG channels at high cytosolic Ca2+ levels in dark-adapted photoreceptors."
"CHIU, Joanna C",Nutrient-sensitive protein O-GlcNAcylation shapes daily biological rhythms,"O-linked-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) is a nutrient-sensitive protein modification that alters the structure and function of a wide range of proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. Similar to phosphorylation, another protein modification that targets serine and threonine residues, O-GlcNAcylation occupancy on cellular proteins exhibits daily rhythmicity and has been shown to play critical roles in regulating daily rhythms in biology by modifying circadian clock proteins and downstream effectors. We recently reported that daily rhythm in global O-GlcNAcylation observed in Drosophila tissues is regulated via the integration of circadian and metabolic signals. Significantly, mistimed feeding, which disrupts coordination of these signals, is sufficient to dampen daily O-GlcNAcylation rhythm and is predicted to negatively impact animal biological rhythms and health span. In this review, we provide an overview of published and potential mechanisms by which metabolic and circadian signals regulate hexosamine biosynthetic pathway metabolites and enzymes, as well as O-GlcNAc processing enzymes to shape daily O-GlcNAcylation rhythms. We also discuss the significance of functional interactions between O-GlcNAcylation and other post-translational modifications in regulating biological rhythms. Finally, we highlight organ/tissue-specific cellular processes and molecular pathways that could be modulated by rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation to regulate time-of-day-specific biology."

Detection of avian pox in free-ranging birds historically relied on observations of visual lesions and/or histopathology, both which can underestimate avian pox prevalence. We compared traditional visual observation methods for avian pox with molecular methods that utilize minimally invasive samples (blood, toenail clipping, feathers, and dermal swabs) in an ecologically important group of birds, hummingbirds. Specifically, avian pox prevalence in several species of hummingbirds were examined across multiple locations using three different methods: (1) visual inspection of hummingbirds for pox-like lesions from a long-term banding data set, (2) qPCR assay of samples from hummingbird carcasses from wildlife rehabilitation centers, and (3) qPCR assay of samples from live-caught hummingbirds. A stark difference in prevalences among these three methods was identified, with an avian pox prevalence of 1.5% from banding data, 20.4% from hummingbird carcasses, and 32.5% from live-caught hummingbirds in California. This difference in detection rates underlines the necessity of a molecular method to survey for avian pox, and this study establishes one such method that could be applied to other wild bird species. Across all three methods, Anna's hummingbirds harbored significantly higher avian pox prevalence than other species examined, as did males compared with females and birds caught in Southern California compared with Northern California. After hatch-year hummingbirds also harbored higher avian pox prevalences than hatch-year hummingbirds in the California banding data set and the carcass data set. This is the first study to estimate the prevalence of avian pox in hummingbirds and address the ecology of this hummingbird-specific strain of avian pox virus, providing vital information to inform future studies on this charismatic and ecologically important group of birds."
"KASS, Philip H","Craniomaxillofacial trauma in immature dogs-etiology, treatments, and outcomes.","Treatment of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma in dogs often requires a multidisciplinary approach and a thorough understanding of the CMF anatomical structures involved. This retrospective study aimed to utilize computed tomography (CT) studies of immature dogs evaluated for CMF trauma and to describe common fracture locations, treatment modalities, and complications, as well as the fracture healing outcomes. The medical records and CT studies of 94 dogs under 1 year of age over a 13-year period were evaluated. The skeletal location of CMF fractures, as well as the severity of displacement and fragmentation of each fracture, was recorded. Case demographic data and trauma etiology were also recorded. Animal bites accounted for the majority of trauma (71.0%). The most likely bone or region to be fractured was the maxillary bones, followed by the molar region of the mandibles. Up to 37 bones or specific regions were fractured in any given patient, with an average of 8.8 Â± 3.1 fractured bones or regions per dog. Rostral mandibular trauma was associated with intra-articular fractures of the temporomandibular joint (p = 0.016). Patients sustained concomitant injuries in 32% of the cases. Muzzle therapy was the main treatment performed for most dogs (53.2%), followed by soft tissue closure (47.9%) and selective dental extractions (27.6%). Healing complications were recorded in 71.6% of the dogs, with malocclusion being the most reported complication (55.2%), and associated with dentate mandibular jaw fractures (p = 0.05). The average number of complications per dog was 2.4. No statistically significant association was found between treatment modality and healing outcome. There was a positive correlation between the severity of fracture fragmentation and displacement and a negative healing outcome (all rho >0.7). Further treatment was required in 55.6% of the dogs. Additional dental extractions were performed in 77.7% of patients. Healing complications were common in the immature CMF trauma case. Thus, the need for a comprehensive assessment of the entire CMF region during the initial visit, as well as follow-up, preferably using CT or cone beam CT, is underscored."

"LIU, Gang-Yu",GenEvaPa: A generic evaporation package for modeling evaporation in molecular dynamics simulations,"This work presents a novel general tool for modeling the process of evaporation without the need for modifying existing software using Python. The tool was developed based on the MDAnalysis package, which is used to import a Molecular Dynamics trajectory. The tool then removes solvent molecules and outputs a new structure file to be used for further simulation and analysis. This process is designed to be iterated by using the resulting dynamic simulation trajectory as the input file. The evaporation is designed to randomly delete solvent molecules while preserving solvation shells around solutes. The evaporation rate can be controlled by the length of the MD simulations and the number of particles removed between dynamic simulations. Validity of the tool was tested extensively using the Gromacs suite. Advantages of this tool include its genericness, simplicity and user friendliness, as no significant modification of existing software platform or Gromacs specific tools are needed.

The underlying mechanisms for early neuroendocrine differentiation are poorly defined and diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are needed.MethodsWe performed transcriptomic analysis on the enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell line C4-2B MDVR and NEPC patient databases to identify neural lineage signature (NLS) genes. Correlation of NLS genes with clinicopathologic features was determined. Cell viability was determined in C4-2B MDVR and H660 cells after knocking down ARHGEF2 using siRNA. Organoid viability of patient-derived xenografts was measured after knocking down ARHGEF2.ResultsWe identify a 95-gene NLS representing the molecular landscape of neural precursor cell proliferation, embryonic stem cell pluripotency, and neural stem cell differentiation, which may indicate an early or intermediate stage of neuroendocrine differentiation. These NLS genes positively correlate with conventional neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin and synaptophysin, and negatively correlate with AR and AR target genes in advanced prostate cancer. Differentially expressed NLS genes stratify small-cell NEPC from prostate adenocarcinoma, which are closely associated with clinicopathologic features such as Gleason Score and metastasis status. Higher ARGHEF2, LHX2, and EPHB2 levels among the 95 NLS genes correlate with a shortened survival time in NEPC patients. Furthermore, downregulation of ARHGEF2 gene expression suppresses cell viability and markers of neuroendocrine differentiation in enzalutamide-resistant and neuroendocrine cells.ConclusionsThe 95 neural lineage gene signatures capture an early molecular shift toward neuroendocrine differentiation, which could stratify advanced prostate cancer patients to optimize clinical treatment and serve as a source of potential therapeutic targets in advanced prostate cancer."
"MAZET, Jonna A",Seasonal shedding of coronavirus by straw-colored fruit bats at urban roosts in Africa,"The straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is a pteropodid whose conservation is crucial for maintaining functional connectivity of plant populations in tropical Africa. Land conversion has pushed this species to adapt to roosting in urban centers across its range. These colonies often host millions of individuals, creating intensive human-bat contact interfaces that could facilitate the spillover of coronaviruses shed by these bats. A better understanding of coronavirus dynamics in these roosts is needed to identify peak times of exposure risk in order to propose evidence-based management that supports safe human-bat coexistence, as well as the conservation of this chiropteran. We studied the temporal patterns of coronavirus shedding in E. helvum, by testing thousands of longitudinally-collected fecal samples from two spatially distant urban roosts in Ghana and Tanzania. Shedding of coronaviruses peaked during the second part of pup weaning in both roosts. Assuming that coronavirus shedding is directly related to spillover risk, our results indicate that exposure mitigation should target reducing contact between people and E. helvum roosts during the pup ""weaning"" period. This recommendation can be applied across the many highly-populated urban sites occupied by E. helvum across Africa."

Asymptomatic infections can restrict growth, but little is known about their role in global stunting prevalence. We investigated factors related to length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) at 24 months by constructing an interconnected network of various infections, biomarkers of inflammation (as assessed by alpha-1-acid glycoprotein [AGP]), and growth (insulin-like growth factor 1&nbsp;[IGF-1] and collagen X biomarker [CXM]) at 18 months, as well as other children, maternal, and household level factors. Among 604 children, there was a continuous decline in mean LAZ and increased mean length deficit from birth to 24 months. At 18 months&nbsp;of age, the percentage of asymptomatic children who carried each pathogen was: 84.5% enterovirus, 15.5% parechovirus, 7.7% norovirus, 4.6% rhinovirus, 0.6% rotavirus, 69.6% Campylobacter, 53.8% Giardia lamblia, 11.9% malaria parasites, 10.2% Shigella, and 2.7% Cryptosporidium. The mean plasma IGF-1 concentration was 12.5â€‰ng/ml and 68% of the children had systemic inflammation (plasma AGP concentration >1â€‰g/L). Shigella infection was associated with lower LAZ at 24 months through both direct and indirect pathways, whereas enterovirus, norovirus, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and malaria infections were associated with lower LAZ at 24 months indirectly, predominantly through increased systemic inflammation and reduced plasma IGF-1 and CXM concentration at 18 months."
"SHIRURE, Venktesh S",An iPSâ€derived in vitro model of human atrial conduction,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the United States, affecting approximately 1 in 10 adults, and its prevalence is expected to rise as the population ages. Treatment options for AF are limited; moreover, the development of new treatments is hindered by limited (1) knowledge regarding human atrial electrophysiological endpoints (e.g., conduction velocity [CV]) and (2) accurate experimental models. Here, we measured the CV and refractory period, and subsequently calculated the conduction wavelength, in vivo (four subjects with AF and four controls), and ex vivo (atrial slices from human hearts). Then, we created an in vitro model of human atrial conduction using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. This model consisted of iPS-derived human atrial cardiomyocytes plated onto a micropatterned linear 1D spiral design of Matrigel. The CV (34-41â€‰cm/s) of the in vitro model was nearly five times faster than 2D controls (7-9&nbsp;cm/s) and similar to in vivo (40-64â€‰cm/s) and ex vivo (28-51â€‰cm/s) measurements. Our iPS-derived in vitro model recapitulates key features of in vivo atrial conduction and may be a useful methodology to enhance our understanding of AF and model patient-specific disease."

Follow-up calls were made after the workshop to assess treatment utilization. Parents/caregivers experienced significant knowledge and belief changes regarding medication efficacy, willingness to accept physician treatment recommendations, and rejection of non-empirically based treatments. Follow-up data showed that 41% of contacted participants met with physicians to discuss medication utilization and behavioral treatments.

We hypothesized that plasma concentrations of these metabolites would be associated with markers of immune activation in a cohort of healthy adults in a manner consistent with AhR-mediated immune-regulation. We also hypothesized that the plasma Kyn/Trp ratio, a marker of IDO activity, would be associated with immune markers reflecting IDO activation in innate immune cells. Finally, we hypothesized that some intestinal bacteria would be associated with plasma indole, IPA and IAA, and that these bacteria&nbsp;themselves would be associated with immune markers.MethodsA novel set of 88 immune markers, and plasma Trp metabolites, were measured in 362 healthy adults. Bacterial taxa from stool were identified by 16S rRNA gene analysis. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify significant associations with immune markers.ResultsThe sum of indole and IAA was positively associated with natural killer T-cells levels. Kyn and Kyn/Trp were positively associated with neopterin and IP-10, markers of type 1 immunity, and TNF-Î± and C-reactive protein (CRP), markers of the acute phase response, and the regulatory cytokine IL-10.&nbsp;Three bacteria negatively associated with Trp metabolites were associated with markers of immune&nbsp;activation: the family&nbsp;Lachnospiraceae&nbsp;with higher lymphocyte counts but lower level of activated CD4 T-cells, the genus&nbsp;Dorea&nbsp;with higher production of IFN-Î³ by T-cells in PBMC cultures, and the genus&nbsp;Ruminococcus&nbsp;with higher&nbsp;production IL-6 in PBMC cultures stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).ConclusionsIn this cohort of healthy adults bacterial Trp metabolites were not strongly associated with immune markers. Conversely, the Kyn/Trp ratio was strongly associated with markers of systemic inflammation and the acute phase response, consistent with IDO activation in innate immune cells. Finally, commensal&nbsp;bacteria associated with lower plasma (and perhaps intestinal) levels of bacterial Trp metabolites were associated with greater immune activation, possibly reflecting decreased regulatory immune activity related to lower intestinal levels of bacterial indole metabolites."

Methods: Healthy volunteers were imaged serially for up to 12â€‰h after a standard dose of 18F-FDG (nâ€‰=â€‰15) or for up to 3â€‰h after injection of a very low dose (about 5% of a standard dose; nâ€‰=â€‰15). A cohort undergoing standard 18F-FDG PET (nâ€‰=â€‰15) on a conventional scanner with a 22-cm axial field of view served as a comparison group. Arterial wall signal, crosstalk with hematopoietic and lymphoid organs, and image quality were analyzed using standardized techniques. Results: TB PET depicted the large vessel walls with excellent quality. The arterial wall could be imaged with high contrast up to 12â€‰h after tracer injection. Ultralow-dose TB 18F-FDG images yielded a vessel wall signal and target-to-background ratio comparable to those of conventional-dose, short-axial-field-of-view PET. Crosstalk between vessel wall and lymphoid organs was identified with better accuracy in both TB PET cohorts than in conventional PET. Conclusion: TB PET enables detailed assessment of in&nbsp;vivo vessel wall biology and its crosstalk with other organs over an extended time window after tracer injection or at an ultralow tracer dose. These initial observations support the feasibility of serial imaging in low-risk populations and will stimulate future mechanistic studies or therapy monitoring in atherosclerosis and other vessel wall pathologies."

Gating of the hERG channel is characterized by rapid, voltage-dependent, C-type inactivation, which blocks ion conduction and is suggested to involve constriction of the selectivity filter. Mutations S620T and S641A/T within the selectivity filter region of hERG have been shown to alter the voltage dependence of channel inactivation. Because hERG channel blockade is implicated in drug-induced arrhythmias associated with both the open and inactivated states, we used Rosetta to simulate the effects of hERG S620T and S641A/T mutations to elucidate conformational changes associated with hERG channel inactivation and differences in drug binding between the two states. Rosetta modeling of the S641A fast-inactivating mutation revealed a lateral shift of the F627 side chain in the selectivity filter into the central channel axis along the ion conduction pathway and the formation of four lateral fenestrations in the pore. Rosetta modeling of the non-inactivating mutations S620T and S641T suggested a potential molecular mechanism preventing F627 side chain from shifting into the ion conduction pathway during the proposed inactivation process. Furthermore, we used Rosetta docking to explore the binding mechanism of highly selective and potent hERG blockers - dofetilide, terfenadine, and E4031.

All XFEL facilities built until recently provided X-ray pulses at a relatively low repetition rate, with limited data statistics. Here, results from the first megahertz-repetition-rate X-ray scattering experiments at the Spectroscopy and Coherent Scattering (SCS) instrument of the European XFEL are presented. The experimental capabilities that the SCS instrument offers, resulting from the operation at megahertz repetition rates and the availability of the novel DSSC 2D imaging detector, are illustrated. Time-resolved magnetic X-ray scattering and holographic imaging experiments in solid state samples were chosen as representative, providing an ideal test-bed for operation at megahertz rates. Our results are relevant and applicable to any other non-destructive XFEL experiments in the soft X-ray range."

Synthesized compounds were tested against the LPS-induced activation of primary murine macrophages. The most prominent anti-inflammatory activity, defined as a suppression of nitric oxide synthesis by LPS-stimulated macrophages, was demonstrated for compounds 4a and 5b. The cytotoxicity of the obtained substances was studied using human neuroblastoma and fibroblast cell cultures. Using these cell assays, the cytotoxic concentration for 4a was 4.7-18.4 times higher than the effective anti-inflammatory concentration. The genotoxicity and the ability to induce oxidative stress was studied using bacterial lux-biosensors.

"HERTZ-PICCIOTTO, Irva","Associations between accelerated parental biologic age, autism spectrum disorder, social traits, and developmental and cognitive outcomes in their children","Parental age is a known risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however, studies to identify the biologic changes underpinning this association are limited. In recent years, ""epigenetic clock"" algorithms have been developed to estimate biologic age and to evaluate how the epigenetic aging impacts health and disease. In this study, we examined the relationship between parental epigenetic aging and their child's prospective risk of ASD and autism related quantitative traits in the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation study. Estimates of epigenetic age were computed using three robust clock algorithms and DNA methylation measures from the Infinium HumanMethylation450k platform for maternal blood and paternal blood specimens collected during pregnancy. Epigenetic age acceleration was defined as the residual of regressing chronological age on epigenetic age while accounting for cell type proportions. Multinomial logistic regression and linear regression models were completed adjusting for potential confounders for both maternal epigenetic age acceleration (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;163) and paternal epigenetic age acceleration (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;80). We found accelerated epigenetic aging in mothers estimated by Hannum's clock was significantly associated with lower cognitive ability and function in offspring at 12â€‰months, as measured by Mullen Scales of Early Learning scores (Î²&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1.66, 95% CI: -3.28, -0.04 for a one-unit increase). We also observed a marginal association between accelerated maternal epigenetic aging by Horvath's clock and increased odds of ASD in offspring at 36â€‰months of age (aOR&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.12, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.26). By contrast, fathers accelerated aging was marginally associated with decreased ASD risk in their offspring (aOR&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.83, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.01). Our findings suggest epigenetic aging could play a role in parental age risks on child brain development."

Sympathetic neurons stimulate sinoatrial myocytes (SAMs) by activating Î² adrenergic receptors (Î²ARs) and increasing cAMP. The funny current (If) is among the cAMP-sensitive currents in SAMs. If is critical for pacemaker activity, however, its role in the fight-or-flight response remains controversial. In this study, we used AP waveform analysis, machine learning, and dynamic clamp experiments in acutely isolated SAMs from mice to quantitatively define the AP waveform changes and role of If in the fight-or-flight increase in AP firing rate. We found that while Î²AR stimulation significantly altered nearly all AP waveform parameters, the increase in firing rate was only correlated with changes in a subset of parameters (diastolic duration, late AP duration, and diastolic depolarization rate). Dynamic clamp injection of the Î²AR-sensitive component of If showed that it accounts for âˆ¼41% of the fight-or-flight increase in AP firing rate and 60% of the decrease in the interval between APs. Thus, If is an essential contributor to the fight-or-flight increase in heart rate."

David",Tryptophan Can Promote Oxygen Reduction to Water in a Biosynthetic Model of Heme Copper Oxidases,"Heme-copper oxidases (HCOs) utilize tyrosine (Tyr) to donate one of the four electrons required for the reduction of O2 to water in biological respiration, while tryptophan (Trp) is speculated to fulfill the same role in cyt bd oxidases. We previously engineered myoglobin into a biosynthetic model of HCOs and demonstrated the critical role that Tyr serves in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To address the roles of Tyr and Trp in these oxidases, we herein report the preparation of the same biosynthetic model with the Tyr replaced by Trp and further demonstrate that Trp can also promote the ORR, albeit with lower activity. An X-ray crystal structure of the Trp variant shows a hydrogen-bonding network involving two water molecules that are organized by Trp, similar to that in the Tyr variant, which is absent in the crystal structure with the native Phe residue. Additional electron paramagnetic resonance measurements are consistent with the formation of a Trp radical species upon reacting with H2O2. We attribute the lower activity of the Trp variant to Trp's higher reduction potential relative to Tyr. Together, these findings demonstrate, for the first time, that Trp can indeed promote the ORR and provides a structural basis for the observation of varying activities. The results support a redox role for the conserved Trp in bd oxidase while suggesting that HCOs use Tyr instead of Trp to achieve higher reactivity."
"IMAI-LEONARD, Denise M",Experimental Infection of Mice with Veronaea botryosa as a Model for Human Phaeohyphomycosis.,"Veronaea botryosa is a ubiquitous, dematiaceous mold capable of causing cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions in humans. In the last decade, V. botryosa has been associated with emergent systemic fungal infections in aquatic animals, including cultured sturgeon (Acipenser spp.), captive amphibians, and wild reptiles. Recently, repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprinting has demonstrated intraspecific variability among V. botryosa isolates from different clinically affected hosts and geographic regions. However, little is known regarding the pathogenic potential of the different genetic clades, and no mammalian model currently exists to investigate V. botryosa phaeohyphomycosis. In this study, we inoculated immunocompetent heterozygotic (nu/+) and immunodeficient homozygotic (nu/nu) Hsd:Athymic Nude-Fox1nu mice subcutaneously or through orogastric gavage with 1 of 3 representative V. botryosa strains that had been recovered from white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), and human hosts and typed by using rep-PCR analysis. Daily mortality and morbidity were recorded, and dissemination of the fungus was investigated through culture of splenic samples and histologic analysis of the injection site, regional lymph nodes, salivary gland, spleen, liver, mesenteric lymph node, and gastrointestinal tract. No differences in survival, fungal burden, or dissemination were observed between fungal strains, routes of inoculation, or host immune status. Fungal infection was observed after subcutaneous inoculation only, was localized to the inoculation site, and was identified in both nu/nu and nu/+ mice. Fungal strain variability was not associated with virulence in a murine model of infection, and this novel mouse model of V. botryosa phaeohyphomycosis recapitulates the human clinical condition."
"SIDDIQUE, Shahid M",The genome and lifestage-specific transcriptomes of a plant-parasitic nematode and its host reveal susceptibility genes involved in trans-kingdom synthesis of vitamin B5,"Plant-parasitic nematodes are a major threat to crop production in all agricultural systems. The scarcity of classical resistance genes highlights a pressing need to find new ways to develop nematode-resistant germplasm. Here, we sequence and assemble a high-quality phased genome of the model cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii to provide a platform for the first system-wide dual analysis of host and parasite gene expression over time, covering all major parasitism stages. Analysis of the hologenome of the plant-nematode infection site identified metabolic pathways that were incomplete in the parasite but complemented by the host. Using a combination of bioinformatic, genetic, and biochemical approaches, we show that a highly atypical completion of vitamin B5 biosynthesis by the parasitic animal, putatively enabled by a horizontal gene transfer from a bacterium, is required for full pathogenicity. Knockout of either plant-encoded or now nematode-encoded steps in the pathway significantly reduces parasitic success. Our experiments establish a reference for cyst nematodes, further our understanding of the evolution of plant-parasitism by nematodes, and show that congruent differential expression of metabolic pathways in the infection hologenome represents a new way to find nematode susceptibility genes. The approach identifies genome-editing-amenable targets for future development of nematode-resistant crops."

Dogs with hyperkalemia or hyponatremia were excluded. Dogs were categorized as controls when the resting serum cortisol or post-ACTH cortisol concentration were > 2 Î¼g/dL. Clinicopathologic and ultrasonographic features were compared between groups. The optimal cut-point, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for individual features used to detect GDH.ResultsDogs were categorized as GDH (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;29) or controls (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;594).

We analyzed the US National Readmission Database (NRD) to investigate the incidence of combined LAAO + CA and compare major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) with matched LAAO-only and CA-only patients.Methods and resultsIn this retrospective study from NRD data, we identified patients undergoing combined LAAO and CA procedures on the same day in the USA from 2016 to 2019. A 1:1 propensity score match was performed to identify patients undergoing LAAO-only and CA-only procedures. The number of LAAO + CA procedures increased from 28 (2016) to 119 (2019). LAAO + CA patients (n = 375, mean age 74 Â± 9.2 years, 53.4% were males) had non-significant higher MACE (8.1%) when compared with LAAO-only (n = 407, 5.3%) or CA-only patients (n = 406, 7.4%), which was primarily driven by higher rate of pericardial effusion (4.3%). All-cause 30-day readmission rates among LAAO + CA patients (10.7%) were similar when compared with LAAO-only (12.7%) or CA-only (17.5%) patients. The most frequent primary reason for readmissions among LAAO + CA and LAAO-only cohorts was heart failure (24.6 and 31.5%, respectively), while among the CA-only cohort, it was paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (25.7%).ConclusionWe report an 63% annual growth (from 28 procedures) in combined LAAO and CA procedures in the USA. There were no significant difference in MACE and all-cause 30-day readmission rates among LAAO + CA patients compared with matched LAAO-only or CA-only patients."
"BANNASCH, Danika",Ocular morphologic traits in the American Cocker Spaniel may confer primary angle closure glaucoma susceptibility,"Acute primary angle closure glaucoma is a potentially blinding ophthalmic emergency requiring prompt treatment to lower the elevated intraocular pressure in humans and dogs. The PACG in most of canine breeds is epidemiologically similar to humans with older and female patients overrepresented with the condition. The American Cocker Spaniel&nbsp;(ACS) is among the most common breeds observed with PACG development in dogs. This study initially sought to identify genetic risk factors to explain the high prevalence of PACG in ACSs by using a case-control breed-matched genome-wide association study. However, the GWAS failed to identify candidate loci associated with PACG in this breed. This study then assessed intrinsic ocular morphologic traits that may relate to PACG susceptibility in this breed. Normal ACSs without glaucoma have a crowded anterior ocular segment and narrow iridocorneal angle and ciliary cleft, which is consistent with anatomical risk factors identified in humans. The ACSs showed unique features consisting of posterior bowing of iris and longer iridolenticular contact, which mirrors reverse pupillary block and pigment dispersion syndrome in humans. The ACS could hold potential to serve as an animal model of naturally occurring PACG in humans."

However, the molecular mechanism involved in the facilitation effect of hERG blockers remains unclear. The hallmark feature of the facilitation effect by hERG blockers is that a depolarizing preconditioning pulse shifts voltage-dependence of hERG activation to more negative voltages. Here we utilize a D540K hERG mutant to study the mechanism of the facilitation effect. D540K hERG is activated by not only depolarization but also hyperpolarization. This unusual gating property enables tests of the mechanism by which voltage induces facilitation of hERG by blockers. With D540K hERG, we find that nifekalant, a hERG blocker and Class III antiarrhythmic agent, blocks and facilitates not only current activation by depolarization but also current activation by hyperpolarization, suggesting a shared gating process upon depolarization and hyperpolarization. Moreover, in response to hyperpolarizing conditioning pulses, nifekalant facilitates D540K hERG currents but not wild-type currents. Our results indicate that induction of facilitation is coupled to pore opening, not voltage per se We propose that gated access to the hERG central cavity underlies the voltage-dependence of induction of facilitation. This study identifies hERG channel pore gate opening as the conformational change facilitated by nifekalant, a clinically important antiarrhythmic agent. Significance Statement Nifekalant is a clinically important antiarrhythmic agent and a hERG blocker which can also facilitate voltage-dependent activation of hERG channels after a preconditioning pulse. Here we show that the mechanism of action of the preconditioning pulse is to open a conductance gate to enable drug access to a facilitation site. Moreover, we find that facilitation increases hERG currents by altering pore dynamics, rather than acting through voltage sensors."

"BOSSUYT, Julie",Diabetes and Excess Aldosterone Promote Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,"Background The pathobiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is still poorly understood, and effective therapies remain limited. Diabetes and mineralocorticoid excess are common and important pathophysiological factors that may synergistically promote HFpEF. The authors aimed to develop a novel animal model of HFpEF that recapitulates key aspects of the complex human phenotype with multiorgan impairments. Methods and Results The authors created a novel HFpEF model combining leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice with a 4-week period of aldosterone infusion. The HFpEF phenotype was assessed using morphometry, echocardiography, Ca2+ handling, and electrophysiology. The sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor empagliflozin was then tested for reversing the arrhythmogenic cardiomyocyte phenotype. Continuous aldosterone infusion for 4â€‰weeks in db/db mice induced marked diastolic dysfunction with preserved ejection fraction, cardiac hypertrophy, high levels of B-type natriuretic peptide, and significant extracardiac comorbidities (including severe obesity, diabetes with marked hyperglycemia, pulmonary edema, and vascular dysfunction). Aldosterone or db/db alone induced only a mild diastolic dysfunction without congestion. At the cellular level, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, prolonged Ca2+ transient decay, and arrhythmogenic action potential remodeling (prolongation, increased short-term variability, delayed afterdepolarizations), and enhanced late Na+ current were observed in aldosterone-treated db/db mice. All of these arrhythmogenic changes were reversed by empagliflozin pretreatment of HFpEF cardiomyocytes. Conclusions The authors conclude that the db/db+aldosterone model may represent a distinct clinical subgroup of HFpEF that has marked hyperglycemia, obesity, and increased arrhythmia risk. This novel HFpEF model can be useful in future therapeutic testing and should provide unique opportunities to better understand disease pathobiology."

When their fractional powers in time and in multi-fractional space are specified to unit integer values, the developed fractional equations of continuity and momentum for incompressible and compressible fluid flow reduce to the classical Navier-Stokes equations. As such, these fractional governing equations for fluid flow may be interpreted as generalizations of the classical Navier-Stokes equations. The derived governing equations of fluid flow in fractional differentiation framework herein are nonlocal in time and space. Therefore, they can quantify the effects of initial and boundary conditions better than the classical Navier-Stokes equations. For the frictionless flow conditions, the corresponding fractional governing equations were also developed as a special case of the fractional governing equations of incompressible flow. When their derivative fractional powers are specified to unit integers, these equations are shown to reduce to the classical Euler equations. The numerical simulations are also performed to investigate the merits of the proposed fractional governing equations. It is shown that the developed equations are capable of simulating anomalous sub- and super-diffusion due to their nonlocal behavior in time and space."

A variety of optical techniques have been developed for the characterization of mechanical motion in MEMS devices. A variety of optical metrology instruments are available to perform these measurements. Cameras based on array photodetectors are low-cost and easy to integrate with computer-based image acquisition and analysis software. High-speed cameras with frame-rates exceeding 10. 000 frames per second are available, it is desirable to measure device motion at frequencies far above this range. Higher precision can be obtained through stroboscopic measurements in which the sample is illuminated with a pulsed light source. Out-of-plane motion in MEMS is conveniently measured using an interferometer. The reflected light beams combine and interfere at the surface of the photodetector or camera. The device topography can be extracted using phase-shifting interferometry (PSI), in which a sequence of interferograms is collected while controlled variations in the relative phase of the measurement and reference path are introduced. The interferograms are then analyzed together to compute the topography of the device under test. Interferometers may also be constructed using optical fiber. The fiber FPI has a number of advantages over free-space interferometers. The fiber FPI is considerably more robust to vibration than a conventional Michelson interferometer. In an interferometer, the coherence length of the light source determines the optical path difference at which the fringe contrast falls to zero. The interferometers described above are based on the interference of laser light with the same wavelength and are classified as homodyne interferometers.

"KNIPE, Marguerite",Electroencephalography of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in a dog with generalized tetanus.,"Case summaryA 3-month-old Airedale dog with clinically diagnosed generalized tetanus was investigated for the occurrence of excessive paddling and chewing movements when sleeping. Electroencephalogram (EEG) with time-locked video over 31â€‰hours determined occurrence of the abnormal movements to be within 20 to 180â€‰seconds of the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but not at any other stage of wakefulness or sleep. No epileptiform activity was noted. Clinical signs of generalized tetanus resolved over 8â€‰weeks with antimicrobial and symptomatic treatment, and sleep-associated movements resolved 6â€‰weeks after presentation.Clinical relevanceRapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) has been suspected in dogs with generalized tetanus but not confirmed by correlation of repeated episodes of vocalization or motor behaviors or both with REM sleep defined by an EEG. The case further defines RBD in dogs with tetanus, and highlights the value of EEG to differentiate among different parasomnias and epileptiform activity."
"MOSHIRI, Ala",Analysis of genome-wide knockout mouse database identifies candidate ciliopathy genes,"We searched a database of single-gene knockout (KO) mice produced by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) to identify candidate ciliopathy genes. We first screened for phenotypes in mouse lines with both ocular and renal or reproductive trait abnormalities. The STRING protein interaction tool was used to identify interactions between known cilia gene products and those encoded by the genes in individual knockout mouse strains in order to generate a list of ""candidate ciliopathy genes."" From this list, 32 genes encoded proteins predicted to interact with known ciliopathy proteins. Of these, 25 had no previously described roles in ciliary pathobiology. Histological and morphological evidence of phenotypes found in ciliopathies in knockout mouse lines are presented as examples (genes Abi2, Wdr62, Ap4e1, Dync1li1, and Prkab1). Phenotyping data and descriptions generated on IMPC mouse line are useful for mechanistic studies, target discovery, rare disease diagnosis, and preclinical therapeutic development trials. Here we demonstrate the effective use of the IMPC phenotype data to uncover genes with no previous role in ciliary biology, which may be clinically relevant for identification of novel disease genes implicated in ciliopathies."
"YAROV-YAROVOY, Vladimir",Adenylyl cyclase isoform 1 contributes to sinoatrial node automaticity via functional microdomains,"Sinoatrial node (SAN) cells are the heart's primary pacemaker. Their activity is tightly regulated by Î²-adrenergic receptor (Î²-AR) signaling. Adenylyl cyclase (AC) is a key enzyme in the Î²-AR pathway that catalyzes the production of cAMP. There are current gaps in our knowledge regarding the dominant AC isoforms and the specific roles of Ca2+-activated ACs in the SAN. The current study tests the hypothesis that distinct AC isoforms are preferentially expressed in the SAN and compartmentalize within microdomains to orchestrate heart rate regulation during Î²-AR signaling. In contrast to atrial and ventricular myocytes, SAN cells express a diverse repertoire of ACs, with ACI as the predominant Ca2+-activated isoform. Although ACI-KO (ACI-/-) mice exhibit normal cardiac systolic or diastolic function, they experience SAN dysfunction. Similarly, SAN-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene silencing of ACI results in sinus node dysfunction. Mechanistically, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 4 (HCN4) channels form functional microdomains almost exclusively with ACI, while ryanodine receptor and L-type Ca2+ channels likely compartmentalize with ACI and other AC isoforms. In contrast, there were no significant differences in T-type Ca2+ and Na+ currents at baseline or after Î²-AR stimulation between WT and ACI-/- SAN cells. Due to its central characteristic feature as a Ca2+-activated isoform, ACI plays a unique role in sustaining the rise of local cAMP and heart rates during Î²-AR stimulation. The findings provide insights into the critical roles of the Ca2+-activated isoform of AC in sustaining SAN automaticity that is distinct from contractile cardiomyocytes."
"RISTENPART, William D",Impact of beverage temperature on consumer preferences for black coffee.,"We recently performed a systematic investigation of consumer preferences for black coffee versus key brewing parameters, including total dissolved solids, extraction yield, and brewing temperature (Cotter et al. in J Food Sci 86(1):194-205, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.15561 ). An experimental goal in that work was for participants to taste the coffee at a beverage temperature of 65&nbsp;Â°C, but the large sample size of more than 3000 individual tastings, combined with natural variations in the brewing and cooling processes, meant that coffees were assessed over a normally distributed range of temperatures between 56 and 71&nbsp;Â°C. Here we use those data to provide a more detailed analysis of the impact of beverage temperature on consumer acceptance of the coffee, with a key objective of identifying beverage temperatures at which no consumers assess the coffee either as too hot or too cold. Using a 5-point just-about-right (JAR) scale, we find that a majority of consumers (>â€‰50%) assessed the temperature as JAR at all temperatures tested up to 70&nbsp;Â°C. A substantial fraction of consumers, approximately 6-12%, assessed the coffee as too cold over the range 56-68&nbsp;Â°C. Only above 70&nbsp;Â°C did a majority of consumers assess the coffee as too hot and none assessed it as too cold, albeit with 40% still assessing it as JAR. Complementary analyses indicate that beverage temperature over this range had little impact on assessments of the adequacy of flavor intensity, acidity, and mouthfeel, but did correlate slightly with overall liking and purchase intent. Overall, the results suggest that temperatures over the range of 58-66&nbsp;Â°C maximize consumer acceptance, and that 68-70&nbsp;Â°C is the minimum temperature range at which no consumers will assess black coffee as too cold."

The purpose of this study is to use whole-genome RNA sequencing to identify and subsequently validate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in femoral head articular cartilage samples from patients with FAI and hip OA secondary to FAI. Thirty-seven patients were included in the study with whole-genome RNA sequencing performed on 10 gender-matched patients in the FAI and OA cohorts and the remaining specimens were used for validation analyses. We identified a total of 3531 DEGs between the FAI and OA cohorts with multiple targets for genes implicated in canonical OA pathways.&nbsp;Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction validation confirmed increased expression of FGF18 and WNT16 in the FAI samples, while there was increased expression of MMP13 and ADAMTS4 in the OA samples. Expression levels of FGF18 and WNT16 were also higher in FAI samples with mild cartilage damage compared to FAI samples with severe cartilage damage or OA cartilage. Our study further expands the knowledge regarding distinct genetic reprogramming in the cartilage between FAI and hip OA patients. We independently validated the results of the sequencing analysis and found increased expression of anabolic markers in patients with FAI and minimal histologic cartilage damage, suggesting that anabolic signaling may be increased in early FAI with a transition to catabolic and inflammatory gene expression as FAI progresses towards more severe hip OA.&nbsp;Clinical significance:Cam-type&nbsp;FAI has a strong clinical association with hip OA; however, the cellular pathophysiology of disease progression remains poorly understood. Several previous studies have demonstrated increased expression of inflammatory markers in FAI cartilage samples, suggesting the involvement of these inflammatory pathways in the disease progression. Our study further expands the knowledge regarding distinct genetic reprogramming in the cartilage between FAI and hip OA patients. In addition to differences in inflammatory gene expression, we also identified differential expression in multiple pathways involved in hip OA progression."
"WINTER, Sebastian E",Colonocyte-derived lactate promotes E. coli fitness in the context of inflammation-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis,"BackgroundIntestinal inflammation disrupts the microbiota composition leading to an expansion of Enterobacteriaceae family members (dysbiosis). Associated with this shift in microbiota composition is a profound change in the metabolic landscape of the intestine. It is unclear how changes in metabolite availability during gut inflammation impact microbial and host physiology.ResultsWe investigated microbial and host lactate metabolism in murine models of infectious and non-infectious colitis. During inflammation-associated dysbiosis, lactate levels in the gut lumen increased. The disease-associated spike in lactate availability was significantly reduced in mice lacking the lactate dehydrogenase A subunit in intestinal epithelial cells. Commensal E. coli and pathogenic Salmonella, representative Enterobacteriaceae family members, utilized lactate via the respiratory L-lactate dehydrogenase LldD to increase fitness. Furthermore, mice lacking the lactate dehydrogenase A subunit in intestinal epithelial cells exhibited lower levels of inflammation in a model of non-infectious colitis.ConclusionsThe release of lactate by intestinal epithelial cells during gut inflammation impacts the metabolism of gut-associated microbial communities. These findings suggest that during intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis, changes in metabolite availability can perpetuate colitis-associated disturbances of microbiota composition.

"LEACH, Kent",Strategies to capitalize on cell spheroid therapeutic potential for tissue repair and disease modeling,"Cell therapies offer a tailorable, personalized treatment for use in tissue engineering to address defects arising from trauma, inefficient wound repair, or congenital malformation. However, most cell therapies have achieved limited success to date. Typically injected in solution as monodispersed cells, transplanted cells exhibit rapid cell death or insufficient retention at the site, thereby limiting their intended effects to only a few days. Spheroids, which are dense, three-dimensional (3D) aggregates of cells, enhance the beneficial effects of cell therapies by increasing and prolonging cell-cell and cell-matrix signaling. The use of spheroids is currently under investigation for many cell types. Among cells under evaluation, spheroids formed of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are particularly promising. MSC spheroids not only exhibit increased cell survival and retained differentiation, but they also secrete a potent secretome that promotes angiogenesis, reduces inflammation, and attracts endogenous host cells to promote tissue regeneration and repair. However, the clinical translation of spheroids has lagged behind promising preclinical outcomes due to hurdles in their formation, instruction, and use that have yet to be overcome. This review will describe the current state of preclinical spheroid research and highlight two key examples of spheroid use in clinically relevant disease modeling. It will highlight techniques used to instruct the phenotype and function of spheroids, describe current limitations to their use, and offer suggestions for the effective translation of cell spheroids for therapeutic treatments."

Shoot traits are generally overlooked in these studies, probably because the rosettes are often askew. A technique to assess the shoot surface area of seedlings grown inside agar culture dishes would facilitate simultaneous root and shoot phenotyping.MethodsWe developed an image processing workflow in Python that estimates rosette area of Arabidopsis seedlings on agar culture dishes. We validated this method by comparing its output with other metrics of seedling growth. As part of a larger study on genetic variation in plant responses to nitrogen form and concentration, we measured the rosette areas from more than 2000 plate images.ResultsThe rosette area measured from plate images was strongly correlated with the rosette area measured from directly overhead and moderately correlated with seedling mass. Rosette area in the large image set was significantly influenced by genotype and nitrogen treatment. The broad-sense heritability of leaf area measured using this method was 0.28.DiscussionThese results indicated that this approach for estimating rosette area produces accurate shoot phenotype data. It can be used with image sets for which other methods of leaf area quantification prove unsuitable."
"HWANG, Changil",Genomic heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer organoids and its stability with culture,"The establishment of patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoid culture in recent years creates an exciting opportunity for researchers to perform a wide range of in vitro studies on a model that closely recapitulates the tumor. One of the outstanding question in pancreatic cancer biology is the causes and consequences of genomic heterogeneity observed in the disease. However, to use pancreatic cancer organoids as a model to study genomic variations, we need to first understand the degree of genomic heterogeneity and its stability within organoids. Here, we used single-cell whole-genome sequencing to investigate the genomic heterogeneity of two independent pancreatic cancer organoid lines, as well as their genomic stability with extended culture. Clonal populations with similar copy number profiles were observed within the organoids, and the proportion of these clones was shifted with extended culture, suggesting the growth advantage of some clones. However, sub-clonal genomic heterogeneity was also observed within each clonal population, indicating the genomic instability of the pancreatic cancer cells themselves. Furthermore, our transcriptomic analysis also revealed a positive correlation between copy number alterations and gene expression regulation, suggesting the ""gene dosage"" effect of these copy number alterations that translates to gene expression regulation."

"SLUPSKY, Carolyn M",The essential roles of FXR in diet and age influenced metabolic changes and liver disease development: a multi-omics study,"Abstract: 

        Background
 Aging and diet are risks for metabolic diseases. Bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) knockout (KO) mice develop metabolic liver diseases that progress into cancer as they age, which is accelerated by Western diet (WD) intake. The current study uncovers the molecular signatures for diet and age-linked metabolic liver disease development in an FXR-dependent manner.
Methods
 Wild-type (WT) and FXR KO male mice, either on a healthy control diet (CD) or a WD, were euthanized at the ages of 5-, 10-, or 15-months. Hepatic transcriptomics, liver, serum, and urine metabolomics as well as microbiota were profiled.
Results
 WD intake facilitated hepatic aging in WT mice. In an FXR-dependent manner, increased inflammation and reduced oxidative phosphorylation were the primary pathways affected by WD and aging. FXR has a role in modulating inflammation and B cell-mediated humoral immunity which was enhanced by aging. Moreover, FXR dictated neuron differentiation, muscle contraction, and cytoskeleton organization in addition to metabolism. There were 654 transcripts commonly altered by diets, ages, and FXR KO, and 76 of them were differentially expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and healthy livers. Urine metabolites differentiated dietary effects in both genotypes, and serum metabolites clearly separated ages irrespective of diets. Aging and FXR KO commonly affected amino acid metabolism and TCA cycle. Moreover, FXR is essential for colonization of age-related gut microbes. Integrated analyses uncovered metabolites and bacteria linked with hepatic transcripts affected by WD intake, aging, and FXR KO as well as related to HCC patient survival.
Conclusion
 FXR is target to prevent diet or age-associated metabolic disease. The uncovered metabolites and microbes can be diagnostic markers for metabolic disease."
"OLSTAD, Katherine J",Dam-Infant Rhesus Macaque Pairs to Dissect Age-Dependent Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"The global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a pandemic of unprecedented scale. An intriguing feature of the infection is the minimal disease in most children, a demographic at higher risk for other respiratory viral diseases. To investigate age-dependent effects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we inoculated two rhesus macaque monkey dam-infant pairs with SARS-CoV-2 and conducted virological and transcriptomic analyses of the respiratory tract and evaluated systemic cytokine and Ab responses. Viral RNA levels in all sampled mucosal secretions were comparable across dam-infant pairs in the respiratory tract. Despite comparable viral loads, adult macaques showed higher IL-6 in serum at day 1 postinfection whereas CXCL10 was induced in all animals. Both groups mounted neutralizing Ab responses, with infants showing a more rapid induction at day 7. Transcriptome analysis of tracheal airway cells isolated at day 14 postinfection revealed significant upregulation of multiple IFN-stimulated genes in infants compared with adults. In contrast, a profibrotic transcriptomic signature with genes associated with cilia structure and function, extracellular matrix composition and metabolism, coagulation, angiogenesis, and hypoxia was induced in adults compared with infants. Our study in rhesus macaque monkey dam-infant pairs suggests age-dependent differential airway responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and describes a model that can be used to investigate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis between infants and adults."
"STEWART, Christine P","The association between plasma choline, growth&nbsp;and neurodevelopment among Malawian children aged 6-15 months enroled in an egg intervention trial.","Choline is an essential micronutrient that may influence growth and development; however, few studies have examined postnatal choline status and children's growth and development in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this observational analysis was to examine associations of plasma choline with growth and development among Malawian children aged&nbsp;6-15 months enrolled in an egg intervention trial. Plasma choline and related metabolites (betaine, dimethylglycine&nbsp;and trimethylamine N-oxide) were measured at baseline and 6-month follow-up, along with anthropometric (length, weight, head circumference) and developmental assessments (the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool [MDAT], the Infant Orienting with Attention task [IOWA], a visual paired comparison [VPC] task&nbsp;and an elicited imitation [EI] task). In cross-sectional covariate-adjusted models, each 1â€‰SD higher plasma choline was associated with lower length-for-age z-score (-0.09â€‰SD [95% confidence interval,&nbsp;CI -0.17 to&nbsp;-0.01]), slower IOWA response time (8.84â€‰ms [1.66-16.03])&nbsp;and faster processing speed on the VPC task (-203.5â€‰ms [-366.2 to&nbsp;-40.7]). In predictive models, baseline plasma choline was negatively associated with MDAT fine motor z-score at 6-month follow-up (-0.13â€‰SD [-0.22 to&nbsp;-0.04]). There were no other significant associations of plasma choline with child measures. Similarly, associations of choline metabolites with growth and development were null except higher trimethylamine N-oxide was associated with slower information processing on the VPC task and higher memory scores on the EI task. In this cohort of children with low dietary choline intake, we conclude that there were no strong or consistent associations between plasma choline and growth and development."

The objective of our study was to determine the molecular effects of an HGD on hippocampal microvessels and cognitive function and determine if a soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor (sEHI), known to be vasculoprotective and anti-inflammatory, modulates these effects. Wild type male mice were fed a low glycemic diet (LGD, 12% sucrose/weight) or an HGD (34% sucrose/weight) with/without the sEHI, trans-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid (t-AUCB), for 12 weeks. Brain hippocampal microvascular gene expression was assessed by microarray and data analyzed using a multi-omic approach for differential expression of protein and non-protein-coding genes, gene networks, functional pathways, and transcription factors. Global hippocampal microvascular gene expression was fundamentally different for mice fed the HGD vs. the LGD. The HGD response was characterized by differential expression of 608 genes involved in cell signaling, neurodegeneration, metabolism, and cell adhesion/inflammation/oxidation effects reversible by t-AUCB and hence sEH inhibitor correlated with protection against Alzheimer's dementia. Ours is the first study to demonstrate that high dietary glycemia contributes to brain hippocampal microvascular inflammation through sEH."

"MILENKOVIC, Dragan",In silico analysis of antidiabetic potential of phenolic compounds from blue corn (Zea mays L.) and black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.),"The growing interest in bioactive compounds, especially in polyphenols, is due to their abundance in the human diet and potentially positive effects on health. The consumption of polyphenols has been shown to possess anti-diabetic properties by preventing insulin resistance or insulin secretion through different signaling pathways, this effect is associated with their capacity to exert genomic modulations. Several studies have suggested that polyphenols could also bind to cellular proteins and modulate their activity, however, the mechanisms of action underlying their beneficial effects are complex and are not fully understood. The aim of this work was to characterize phenolic compounds present in blue corn and black bean extracts as well as identify their potential interactions with target proteins involved in diabetes pathogenesis using in silico approach. Total polyphenols content of both blue corn and black beans was identified using UPLC-ESI/qTOF/MS and quantified by colorimetric assays. In this work we identified twenty-eight phenolic compounds in the extracts, mainly anthocyanins, flavonols, hydroxycinamic acids, dihydroxybenzoic acids, flavones, isoflavones, and flavanols. Interactome of these compounds with thirteen target proteins involved in type 2 diabetes mellitus was performed in-silico. In total, 312 bioactive compounds/protein interaction analyses were acquired. Molecular docking results highlighted that nine of the top ten interactions correspond to anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside with 11Î²-HS, GFAT, PPARG; delphinidin 3-glucoside with 11Î²-HS, GFAT, PTP and RTKs; and petunidin 3-glucoside with 11Î²-HS and PTP. These proteins are involved in mechanisms regulating functions such as inflammation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, glucose and lipid metabolism. In conclusion, this work provides a prediction of the potential molecular mechanism of black bean and blue corn polyphenols, specifically anthocyanins and could constitute new pathways by which compounds exert their antidiabetic benefits."

PCBs are classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, but the full range of potential noncancer health effects from exposure to PCBs has not been systematically summarized and evaluated. We used systematic review methods to identify and screen the literature using combined manual review and machine learning approaches. A protocol was developed that describes the literature search strategy and Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria used to facilitate subsequent screening and categorization of literature into a systematic evidence map of PCB exposure and noncancer health endpoints across 15 organs/systems. A comprehensive literature search yielded 62,599 records. After electronic prioritization steps, 17,037 studies were manually screened at the title and abstract level. An additional 900 studies identified by experts or supplemental searches were also included. After full-text screening of 3889 references, 1586 studies met the PECO criteria. Relevant study details such as the endpoints assessed, exposure duration, and species were extracted into literature summary tables. This review compiles and organizes the human and mammalian studies from these tables into an evidence map for noncancer health endpoints and PCB mixture exposure to identify areas of robust research as well as areas of uncertainty that would benefit from future investigation. Summary data are available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. Sufficient research is available to inform PCB hazard assessments for most organs/systems, but the amount of data to inform associations with specific endpoints differs. Furthermore, despite many years of research, sparse data exist for inhalation and dermal exposures, which are highly relevant human exposure routes. This evidence map provides a foundation for future systematic reviews and noncancer hazard assessments of PCB mixtures and for strategic planning of research to inform areas of greater uncertainty."
"SARIGUL-KLIJN, Nesrin",Structural optimization for light-weight articulated rotor blade,"An efficient multidisciplinary design optimization method is developed and applied in design of a minimum weight, minimum vibration and maximum material strength rotor blade with requirements on aeroelastic flutter velocity. The design example is a high aspect ratio articulated flexible blade with a thin-walled multicell cross section at high tip Mach numbers. The rotor blade analysis sets consist of three subsets; the first subset is an elastic analysis for stress prediction using idealized model, the second subset is a dynamic analysis for optimal natural frequency placement and vibratory vertical hub shear reduction using finite element method, and third subset is a dynamic aeroelastic analysis for accurate instability boundary prediction using Rayleigh-Ritz method. In the first subset, the discretization of the blade using chordwise segments and spanwise elements procedure introduced in this paper allows systematic evaluation of not only the blade cross sectional properties but also the axial stresses and shear flows on all chordwise segments of all spanwise elements. Therefore, this approach provides efficient material reassignment for minimum weight design. The optimization procedure is decomposed into two levels for more efficient handling of the design variables and objective functions, and their correlation. The optimization results show the efficiency of the method developed in this paper, the effects of tuning masses and their locations on the hub shear reduction, and the effects of using isotropic versus composite materials in design."

obviously in infancy, we learn without explicit instruction. We propose a
detailed biological mechanism for the widely-embraced idea that learning is
based on the differences between predictions and actual outcomes (i.e.,
predictive error-driven learning). Specifically, numerous weak projections into
the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus generate top-down predictions, and sparse,
focal driver inputs from lower areas supply the actual outcome, originating in
layer 5 intrinsic bursting (5IB) neurons. Thus, the outcome is only briefly
activated, roughly every 100 msec (i.e., 10 Hz, alpha), resulting in a temporal
difference error signal, which drives local synaptic changes throughout the
neocortex, resulting in a biologically-plausible form of error backpropagation
learning. We implemented these mechanisms in a large-scale model of the visual
system, and found that the simulated inferotemporal (IT) pathway learns to
systematically categorize 3D objects according to invariant shape properties,
based solely on predictive learning from raw visual inputs. These categories
match human judgments on the same stimuli, and are consistent with neural

However, little is known about the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that determine how these stem cells are maintained and how they give rise to their diverse differentiated progeny. To address such questions, a thorough understanding of transcriptional regulation in Hydra is needed. To this end, we generated extensive new resources for characterizing transcriptional regulation in Hydra, including new genome assemblies for Hydra oligactis and the AEP strain of Hydra vulgaris, an updated whole-animal single-cell RNA-seq atlas, and genome-wide maps of chromatin interactions, chromatin accessibility, sequence conservation, and histone modifications. These data revealed the existence of large kilobase-scale chromatin interaction domains in the Hydra genome that contain transcriptionally coregulated genes. We also uncovered the transcriptomic profiles of two previously molecularly uncharacterized cell types: isorhiza-type nematocytes and somatic gonad ectoderm. Finally, we identified novel candidate regulators of cell type-specific transcription, several of which have likely been conserved at least since the divergence of Hydra and the jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica more than 400 million years ago."

"GONCHAROVA, Elena A",VCAM-1 is a TGF-Î²1 inducible gene upregulated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lethal interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. We previously reported that high plasma levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) predict mortality in IPF subjects. Here we investigated the cellular origin and potential role of VCAM-1 in regulating primary lung fibroblast behavior. VCAM-1 mRNA was significantly increased in lungs of subjects with IPF compared to lungs from control subjects (p=0.001), and it negatively correlated with two markers of lung function, forced vital capacity (FVC) and pulmonary diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). VCAM-1 protein levels were highly expressed in IPF subjects where it was detected in fibrotic foci and blood vessels of IPF lung. Treatment of human lung fibroblasts with TGF-Î²1 significantly increased steady-state VCAM1 mRNA and protein levels without affecting VCAM1 mRNA stability. Further, cellular depletion of VCAM-1 inhibited fibroblast cell proliferation and reduced G2/M and S phases of the cell cycle suggestive of cell cycle arrest. These effects on cell cycle progression triggered by VCAM1 depletion were associated with reductions in levels of phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 and cyclin D1. Thus, these observations suggest that VCAM-1 is a TGF-Î²1 responsive mediator that partakes in fibroblast proliferation in subjects with IPF."

"STEINBERG, Francene M","Validation of Diet IDâ„¢ in Predicting Nutrient Intake Compared to Dietary Recalls, Skin Carotenoid Scores, and Plasma Carotenoids in University Students.","Background and Aim: Collecting accurate dietary information in the research setting is challenging due to the inherent biases, duration, and resource-intensive nature of traditional data collection methods. Diet IDâ„¢ is a novel, rapid assessment method that uses an image-based algorithm to identify dietary patterns and estimate nutrient intake. The purpose of this analysis was to explore the criterion validity between Diet IDâ„¢ and additional measures of dietary intake. Methods: This prospective cohort study (n = 42) collected dietary information using Diet IDâ„¢, the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR), plasma carotenoid concentrations, and the Veggie MeterÂ® to estimate carotenoid levels in the skin. Results: There were significant correlations between Diet IDâ„¢ and NDSR for diet quality, calories, carbohydrates, protein, fiber, and cholesterol. Vitamin A and carotenoid intake were significantly correlated, with the exception of Î±-carotene and lycopene. Significant correlations were observed for calcium, folate, iron, sodium, potassium, Vitamins B2, B3, B6, C, and E. Skin carotenoid scores and plasma carotenoids were correlated with carotenoid intake from Diet IDâ„¢. Conclusions: Diet IDâ„¢ may be a useful tool in nutrition research as a less time-intensive and minimally burdensome dietary data collection method for both participants and researchers."

We evaluated changes in muscle activity of thirty-seven individuals with chronic stroke (>â€‰6&nbsp;months), in response to a single session of LT at their self-selected or fastest-comfortable speed (FS) with three levels of BWS (0%, 15%, and 30%), and at FS with 30% BWS and seven different combinations of therapist assistance at the paretic foot, non-paretic foot, and trunk. Altered Muscle Activation Pattern (AMAP), a previously developed tool in our lab was used to evaluate the effects of LT parameter variation on eight lower-extremity muscle patterns in individuals with stroke. Repeated-measures mixed-model ANOVA was used to determine the effects of speed, BWS, and their interaction on AMAP scores. The Wilcoxon-signed rank test was used to determine the effects of therapist-assisted conditions on AMAP scores. Increased BWS mostly improved lower-extremity muscle activity patterns, but increased speed resulted in worse plantar flexor activity. Abnormal early plantar flexor activity during stance decreased with assistance at trunk and both feet, exaggerated plantar flexor activity during late swing decreased with assistance to the non-paretic foot or trunk, and diminished gluteus medius activity during stance increased with assistance to paretic foot and/or trunk. Therefore, different sets of training parameters have different immediate effects on activation patterns of each muscle and gait subphases."
"MARCO, Maria",The Role of the Gut Microbiome in Predicting Response to Diet and the Development of Precision Nutrition Models. Part II: Results.,"The gut microbiota is increasingly implicated in the health and metabolism of its human host. The host's diet is a major component influencing the composition and function of the gut microbiota, and mounting evidence suggests that the composition and function of the gut microbiota influence the host's metabolic response to diet. This effect of the gut microbiota on personalized dietary response is a growing focus of precision nutrition research and may inform the effort to tailor dietary advice to the individual. Because the gut microbiota has been shown to be malleable to some extent, it may also allow for therapeutic alterations of the gut microbiota in order to alter response to certain dietary components. This article is the second in a 2-part review of the current research in the field of precision nutrition incorporating the gut microbiota into studies investigating interindividual variability in response to diet. Part I reviews the methods used by researchers to design and carry out such studies as well as analyze the results subsequently obtained. Part II reviews the findings of these studies and discusses the gaps in our current knowledge and directions for future research. The studies reviewed provide the current understanding in this field of research and a foundation from which we may build, utilizing and expanding upon the methods and results they present to inform future studies."
"KEIM, Nancy L",Increasing Dietary Carbohydrate as Part of a Healthy Whole Food Diet Intervention Dampens Eight Week Changes in Salivary Cortisol and Cortisol Responsiveness,"It is largely unknown whether and how whole food diets influence psychological stress and stress system responsiveness. To better understand the effects of whole diets on stress system responsiveness, we examined randomized control trial effects of a whole food diet based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) on cortisol responsiveness. A randomized, double-blind, controlled 8-week intervention was conducted in overweight and obese women to examine differentiated effects between two diet intervention groups: one based on the 2010 DGA and the other one based on a typical American diet (TAD). During a test week that occurred at baseline and again after 8 weeks of the intervention, we assessed salivary cortisol collected at 14 selected times across the day, including upon awakening, at bedtime, and during a test visit, and administered a standardized social stress task (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). There were no statistical differences between the diet groups in salivary cortisol at baseline or after 8 weeks. However, when considering differences in dietary carbohydrate, but not fat or protein, from the pre-intervention (habitual) to the intervention period, there was a significant (P = 0.0001) interaction between diet group, intervention week, saliva sample, and level of intervention-based change in carbohydrate consumption. This interaction was reflected primarily by an 8-week reduction in salivary cortisol during a period just prior to (log Î” -0.35 Â± 0.12 nmol/L) and 30 (log Î” -0.49 Â± 0.12 nmol/L), 60 (log Î” -0.50 Â± 0.13 nmol/L), 90 (log Î” -0.51 Â± 0.13 nmol/L), and 120 (log Î” -0.4476 Â± 0.1231 nmol/L) min after the TSST in the DGA group having the highest increase (90th percentile) in carbohydrate consumption. In support of this finding, we also found significant (P < 0.05) and inverse linear associations between dietary carbohydrate and log salivary cortisol, with the strongest negative association (Î²: -0.004 Â± 0.0015, P = 0.009) occurring at 30 min post-TSST, but only in the DGA group and at week 9 of the intervention. Together, increasing dietary carbohydrate as part of a DGA-based diet may reduce circulating cortisol and dampen psychological stress-related cortisol responsiveness."

"STEPHENSEN, Charles B",High-Dose Neonatal Vitamin A Supplementation Transiently Decreases Thymic Function in Early Infancy,"BackgroundVitamin A deficiency (VAD) impairs T-cell-mediated immunity. In regions where VAD is prevalent, vitamin A supplementation (VAS) reduces child mortality, perhaps by improving immune function.ObjectiveOur objective was to determine if neonatal VAS would improve thymic function in Bangladeshi infants, and to determine if such effects differed by sex or nutritional status (i.e., birth weight above/below the median).MethodsThree hundred and six infants were randomly assigned to 50,000 IU vitamin A (VA) or placebo (PL) within 48 h of birth. Primary outcomes were measured at multiple ages and included 1) thymic index (TI) at 1, 6, 10, and 15 wk; 2) T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC), an index of thymic output of naÃ¯ve T cells; and 3) total/naÃ¯ve T cells in peripheral blood at 6 wk, 15 wk, and 2 y. A mixed linear model for repeated measures was used to assess group differences at each age and identify interactions with sex and birth weight.ResultsVAS did not significantly (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.21) affect TI overall (i.e., at all ages) but decreased TI by 7.8% (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.029) at 6 wk: adjusted TI means for the PL and VA groups at 1, 6, 10, and 15 wk were 4.09 compared with 3.80 cm2, 7.78 compared with 7.18 cm2, 8.11 compared with 7.84 cm2, and 7.91 compared with 7.97 cm2, respectively. VAS did not significantly (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.25) affect TREC overall but decreased TREC by 19% (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.029) at 15 wk: adjusted TREC means for the PL and VA groups at 6 wk, 15 wk, and 2 y were 13.6 compared with 16.1 copies/pg DNA, 19.4 compared with 15.7 copies/pg DNA, and 11.8 compared with 10.0 copies/pg DNA, respectively. VAS did not significantly affect overall total (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.10) or naÃ¯ve (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.092) T cells: adjusted naÃ¯ve T-cell means for the PL and VA groups at 6 wk, 15 wk, and 2 y were 3259 compared with 3109 cells/ÂµL, 3771 compared with 3487 cells/ÂµL, and 1976 compared with 1898 cells/ÂµL, respectively.ConclusionIn contrast to our hypothesis, VAS decreased thymic function early in infancy but health effects are presumably negligible owing to the transience and small magnitude of this effect. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01583972 and NCT02027610."
"NONNECKE, Eric","Trace Element Interactions, Inflammatory Signaling, and Male Sex Implicated in Reduced Growth Following Excess Oral Iron Supplementation in Pre-Weanling Rats","Iron supplements are frequently provided to infants in high-income countries despite low incidence of iron deficiency. There is growing concern regarding adverse health and development outcomes of excess iron provision in early life. Excess iron may directly damage developing organs through the formation of reactive oxygen species, alter systemic inflammatory signaling, and/or dysregulate trace mineral metabolism. To better characterize the in vivo effects of excess iron on development, we utilized a pre-weanling rat pup model. Lewis rat litters were culled to eight pups (four males and four females) and randomly assigned to daily supplementation groups receiving either vehicle control (CON; 10% w/v sucrose solution) or ferrous sulfate (FS) iron at one of the following doses: 10, 30, or 90 mg iron/kg body weight-FS-10, FS-30, and FS-90, respectively-from postnatal day (PD) 2 through 9. FS-90 litters, but not FS-30 or FS-10, failed to thrive compared to CON litters and had smaller brains on PD 10. Among the groups, FS-90 liver iron levels were highest, as were white blood cell counts. Compared to CON, circulating MCP-1 and liver zinc were increased in FS-90 pups, whereas liver copper was decreased. Growth defects due to excess FS provision in pre-weanling rats may be related to liver injury, inflammation, and altered trace mineral metabolism."

African Americans report more external locus of control than non-Hispanic Whites, and external locus of control is associated with poorer health and cognition. The aims of this study were to compare cognitive training gains between African American and non-Hispanic White participants in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study and determine whether racial differences in training gains are mediated by locus of control. The sample comprised 2,062 (26% African American) adults aged 65 and older who participated in memory, reasoning, or speed training. Latent growth curve models evaluated predictors of 10-year cognitive trajectories separately by training group. Multiple group modeling examined associations between training gains and locus of control across racial groups. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans evidenced less improvement in memory and reasoning performance after training. These effects were partially mediated by locus of control, controlling for age, sex, education, health, depression, testing site, and initial cognitive ability. African Americans reported more external locus of control, which was associated with smaller training gains. External locus of control also had a stronger negative association with reasoning training gain for African Americans than for Whites. No racial difference in training gain was identified for speed training. Future intervention research with African Americans should test whether explicitly targeting external locus of control leads to greater cognitive improvement following cognitive training."

VBL is characterized by a narrow therapeutic index, with key dose-limiting toxicities being myelosuppression and neurotoxicity. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of VBL is primarily driven by ABCB1-mediated efflux and CYP3A4 metabolism, creating potential for drug-drug interaction. To characterize sources of variability in VBL PK, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model in Mdr1a/b(-/-) knockout and wild-type mice by incorporating key drivers of PK, including ABCB1 efflux, CYP3A4 metabolism, and tissue-specific tubulin binding, and scaled this model to accurately simulate VBL PK in humans and pet dogs. To investigate the capability of the model to capture interindividual variability in clinical data, virtual populations of humans and pet dogs were generated through Monte Carlo simulation of physiologic and biochemical parameters and compared to the clinical PK data. This model provides a foundation for predictive modeling of VBL PK. The base PBPK model can be further improved with supplemental experimental data identifying drug-drug interactions, ABCB1 polymorphisms and expression, and other sources of physiologic or metabolic variability."
"MOSHIRI, Ala",A Spontaneous Nonhuman Primate Model of Myopic Foveoschisis,"PurposeFoveoschisis involves the pathologic splitting of retinal layers at the fovea, which may occur congenitally in X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) or as an acquired complication of myopia. XLRS is attributed to functional loss of the retinal adhesion protein retinoschisin 1 (RS1), but the pathophysiology of myopic foveoschisis is unclear due to the lack of animal models. Here, we characterized a novel nonhuman primate model of myopic foveoschisis through clinical examination and multimodal imaging followed by morphologic, cellular, and transcriptional profiling of retinal tissues and genetic analysis.MethodsWe identified a rhesus macaque with behavioral and anatomic features of myopic foveoschisis, and monitored disease progression over 14 months by fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). After necropsy, we evaluated anatomic and cellular changes by immunohistochemistry and transcriptomic changes using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq). Finally, we performed Sanger and whole exome sequencing with focus on the RS1 gene.ResultsAffected eyes demonstrated posterior hyaloid traction and progressive splitting of the outer plexiform layer on OCT. Immunohistochemistry showed increased GFAP expression in MÃ¼ller glia and loss of ramified Iba-1+ microglia, suggesting macro- and microglial activation with minimal photoreceptor alterations. SnRNA-seq revealed gene expression changes predominantly in cones and retinal ganglion cells involving chromatin modification, suggestive of cellular stress at the fovea. No defects in the RS1 gene or its expression were detected.ConclusionsThis nonhuman primate model of foveoschisis reveals insights into how acquired myopic traction leads to phenotypically similar morphologic and cellular changes as congenital XLRS without alterations in RS1."

The overarching goal was to determine whether JA, with or without ACC, may hold the potential to sufficiently reduce fruit detachment force (FDF) and increase the proportion of berries with dry stem scars while minimizing preharvest abscission, effects that could be useful in the production of stemless table grapes. On Thompson Seedless grapes, JA was at least as effective as MeJA for stimulating berry abscission based on reduced fruit detachment force (FDF) and yielding detached berries with dry stem scars. Further, since previous studies showed that ACC improved MeJA-induced grape abscission, we tested ACC effects on JA activity. We found that JA rapidly induced preharvest berry abscission, confirming previous results. ACC alone did not induce preharvest berry abscission, but ACC improved the effectiveness of JA on reducing FDF and increasing dry stem scar development. These studies also demonstrated that JA-induced abscission occurs within the first day after treatment. Commercial use of JA plus ACC as an abscission agent requires that FDF sufficiently declines, and the incidence of dry stem scars increases, prior to a significant increase in fruit abscission. However, the rapid progression of fruit abscission may require harvest either within 24 and 48 h after treatment or the use of a passive catch system."

Most of these varieties, however, did not have the optimum cooking quality that was possessed by many of the traditional varieties they replaced. In 1985, the IRRI-developed indica variety IR64 was released in the Philippines. In addition to its high yield, early maturity and disease resistance, it had excellent cooking quality, matching that of the best varieties available. These merits resulted in its rapid spread and cultivation on over 10 million ha in the two decades after it was released. It has intermediate amylose content and gelatinization temperature, and good taste. It is resistant to blast and bacterial blight diseases, and to brown planthopper. Because of its success as a variety, it has been used extensively in scientific studies and has been well-characterized genetically. Many valuable genes have been introduced into IR64 through backcross breeding and it has been used in thousands of crosses. Its area of cultivation has declined in the past 10&nbsp;years, but it has been replaced by a new generation of high-quality varieties that are mostly its progeny or relatives. Continued basic studies on IR64 and related varieties should help in unraveling the complex genetic control of yield and other desirable traits that are prized by rice farmers and consumers."

A series of sEH inhibitors containing naturally occurring lipophilic groups (originating from camphor and fenchone) were developed. Inhibitory potency ranging from 0.7 nM to 6.47 Î¼M was obtained. It was discovered that ureas derived from L-camphor were more active against sEH (2.3-fold average) than the corresponding analogues derived from D-camphor indicating enantiomeric preference of sEH. Ureas derived from fenchone possess lower activity against sEH (ca. 80-fold on average) than their camphor-derived analogs due to the specific structure of the lipophilic fragment and show less enantiomeric preference (1.75-fold on average). Moreover, fenchone-derived ureas show no consistency in enantiomeric preference. Endo/exo-form of compound L-3a derived from L-camphor is 4-fold more potent than the corresponding analogue prepared from D-camphor (IC50 = 0.7 nM vs. 2.8 nM) making it the most promising sEH inhibitor among the tested series."

"THOMPSON, Hannah R",The Relationship between Breastfeeding and Initial Vegetable Introduction with Vegetable Consumption in a National Cohort of Children Ages 1-5 Years from Low-Income Households.,"Compared to other food groups, vegetable intakes are lowest relative to recommendations. Breastfeeding and initial introduction to vegetables may help infants establish long-lasting taste preferences. We examined the relationship between breastfeeding and initial vegetable introduction and vegetable intake in early childhood (ages 13-60 months). This repeated cross-sectional study used data from the national WIC Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study-2 collected from low-income mother/caregivers about infants from around birth through age 5 (60 months; n = 3773). Survey-weighted adjusted regression models assessed associations between breastfeeding and vegetable introduction measures with vegetable consumption at child ages 13, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. Longer breastfeeding duration was associated with a slightly, but significantly, greater variety of vegetables consumed/day in early childhood. There was also a small but positive statistically significant association between the number of different types of vegetables consumed on a given day at 9 months and the amount and variety of vegetables consumed/day in early childhood. Age of initial vegetables introduction and whether vegetables were the first/second food introduced were not consistently related to the amount or variety of vegetables consumed later in childhood. Longer breastfeeding and introduction to a greater variety of vegetables at 9 months may be behaviors to target to increase consumption of a greater variety of vegetables by young children."

While they will play a fundamental role in delivering the UN Sustainable Development Goals, associated opportunities and threats are yet to be considered systematically. We report on a horizon scan evaluating robotics and autonomous systems impact on all Sustainable Development Goals, involving 102 experts from around the world. Robotics and autonomous systems are likely to transform how the Sustainable Development Goals are achieved, through replacing and supporting human activities, fostering innovation, enhancing remote access and improving monitoring. Emerging threats relate to reinforcing inequalities, exacerbating environmental change, diverting resources from tried-and-tested solutions and reducing freedom and privacy through inadequate governance. Although predicting future impacts of robotics and autonomous systems on the Sustainable Development Goals is difficult, thoroughly examining technological developments early is essential to prevent unintended detrimental consequences. Additionally, robotics and autonomous systems should be considered explicitly when developing future iterations of the Sustainable Development Goals to avoid reversing progress or exacerbating inequalities."

"FENNIMORE, Steven A",Temperature response in wild oat (Avena fatua L.) generations segregating for seed dormancy,"Crosses between parents with high and low levels of seed dormancy in wild oat were used to produce F1, F2 and backcross populations. Germination phenotypes were determined by imbibing all populations at 15 and 20Â°C. Rapid germination of genetically more dormant generations was favoured at the lower temperature, i.e. a generation by germination temperature interaction was observed. Evidence that dominance shifted from early germination at 15Â°C to late germination at 20Â°C is presented. Epistatic gene action may have been detected at 20Â°C but not at 15Â°C. Cumulative germination percentages of F1 caryopses imbibed at 10, 15, 20 and 25Â°C revealed an inverse relationship between germination rate and temperature. The narrow-sense family heritability of the seed dormancy phenotype of F7 recombinant inbred lines per se was h(f/2, F=1) = 0.75 with exact confidence limits of 0.64 and 0.83. Six factors were estimated to be segregating between the dormant and nondormant parents. Genotype by germination temperature interactions may play an adaptive role that allows wild oat to persist in diverse ecosystems."

Previously, we identified about 0.9 million SNP markers by sequencing transcriptomes of 27 diverse alfalfa genotypes. From this SNP set, we developed an Illumina Infinium array containing 9,277 SNPs. Using this array, we genotyped 280 diverse alfalfa genotypes and several genotypes from related species. About 81% (7,476) of the SNPs met the criteria for quality control and showed polymorphisms. The alfalfa SNP array also showed a high level of transferability for several closely related Medicago species. Principal component analysis and model-based clustering showed clear population structure corresponding to subspecies and ploidy levels. Within cultivated tetraploid alfalfa, genotypes from dormant and nondormant cultivars were largely assigned to different clusters; genotypes from semidormant cultivars were split between the groups. The extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across all genotypes rapidly decayed to 26 Kbp at r(2)â€Š=â€Š0.2, but the rate varied across ploidy levels and subspecies. A high level of consistency in LD was found between and within the two subpopulations of cultivated dormant and nondormant alfalfa suggesting that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) could be conducted using alfalfa genotypes from throughout the fall dormancy spectrum. However, the relatively low LD levels would require a large number of markers to fully saturate the genome."

"BROWN, Patrick James J",Genomic ancestry estimation quantifies use of wild species in grape breeding,"BackgroundGrapes are one of the world's most valuable crops and most are made into wine. Grapes belong to the genus Vitis, which includes over 60 inter-fertile species. The most common grape cultivars derive their entire ancestry from the species Vitis vinifera, but wild relatives have also been exploited to create hybrid cultivars, often with increased disease resistance.ResultsWe evaluate the genetic ancestry of some of the most widely grown commercial hybrids from North America and Europe. Using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), we generated 2482 SNPs and 56 indels from 7 wild Vitis, 7â€‰V. vinifera, and 64 hybrid cultivars. We used a principal component analysis (PCA) based ancestry estimation procedure and verified its accuracy with both empirical and simulated data. V. vinifera ancestry ranged from 11&nbsp;% to 76&nbsp;% across hybrids studied. Approximately one third (22/64) of the hybrids have ancestry estimates consistent with F1 hybridization: they derive half of their ancestry from wild Vitis and half from V. vinifera.ConclusionsOur results suggest that hybrid grape breeding is in its infancy. The distribution of V. vinifera ancestry across hybrids also suggests that backcrosses to wild Vitis species have been more frequent than backcrosses to V. vinifera during hybrid grape breeding. This pattern is unusual in crop breeding, as it is most common to repeatedly backcross to elite, or domesticated, germplasm. We anticipate our method can be extended to facilitate marker-assisted selection in order to introgress beneficial wild Vitis traits, while allowing for offspring with the highest V. vinifera content to be selected at the seedling stage."

They show behavioral changes, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and increased brain arachidonic acid (AA) enzymes. Aspirin (acetylsalicylate, ASA) inhibits AA oxidation by cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2.HypothesisChronic low-dose ASA will downregulate brain AA metabolism in HIV-1 transgenic rats.MethodsNine month-old HIV-1 transgenic and wildtype rats were given 42 days of 10mg/kg/day ASA or nothing in drinking water; eicosanoids were measured using ELISAs on microwaved brain extracts.ResultsBrain 15-epi-lipoxin A4 and 8-isoprostane concentrations were significantly higher in HIV-1 transgenic than wildtype rats; these differences were prevented by ASA. ASA reduced prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 concentrations in HIV-1 Tg but not wildtype rats. Thromboxane B2, 15-HETE, lipoxin A4 and resolvin D1 concentrations were unaffected by genotype or treatment.ConclusionChronic low-dose ASA reduces AA-metabolite markers of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in a rat model for HAND."
"TAHA, Ameer",Adolescent Behavior and Dopamine Availability Are Uniquely Sensitive to Dietary Omega-3 Fatty Acid Deficiency,"BackgroundUnderstanding the nature of environmental factors that contribute to behavioral health is critical for successful prevention strategies in individuals at risk for psychiatric disorders. These factors are typically experiential in nature, such as stress and urbanicity, but nutrition--in particular dietary deficiency of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs)-has increasingly been implicated in the symptomatic onset of schizophrenia and mood disorders, which typically occurs during adolescence to early adulthood. Thus, adolescence might be the critical age range for the negative impact of diet as an environmental insult.MethodsA rat model involving consecutive generations of n-3 PUFA deficiency was developed on the basis of the assumption that dietary trends toward decreased consumption of these fats began 4-5 decades ago when the parents of current adolescents were born. Behavioral performance in a wide range of tasks as well as markers of dopamine-related neurotransmission was compared in adolescents and adults fed n-3 PUFA adequate and deficient diets.ResultsIn adolescents, dietary n-3 PUFA deficiency across consecutive generations produced a modality-selective and task-dependent impairment in cognitive and motivated behavior distinct from the deficits observed in adults. Although this dietary deficiency affected expression of dopamine-related proteins in both age groups in adolescents but not adults, there was an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase expression that was selective to the dorsal striatum.ConclusionsThese data support a nutritional contribution to optimal cognitive and affective functioning in adolescents. Furthermore, they suggest that n-3 PUFA deficiency disrupts adolescent behaviors through enhanced dorsal striatal dopamine availability."

A multicenter randomized clinical trial compared 2 strategies for medical management and found that mifepristone pretreatment is 25% more effective than the standard of care, misoprostol alone. The cost of mifepristone may be a barrier to implementation of the regimen.ObjectiveTo assess the cost-effectiveness of medical management of EPL with mifepristone pretreatment plus misoprostol vs misoprostol alone in the United States.Design, setting, and participantsThis preplanned. prospective economic evaluation was performed concurrently with a randomized clinical trial in 3 US sites from May 1, 2014, through April 30, 2017. Participants included 300 women with anembryonic gestation or embryonic or fetal demise. Cost-effectiveness was computed from the health care sector and societal perspectives, with a 30-day time horizon. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2018, to July 3, 2019.InterventionsMifepristone pretreatment plus misoprostol administration vs misoprostol alone.Main outcomes and measuresCosts in 2018 US dollars, effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and treatment efficacy. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of mifepristone and misoprostol vs misoprostol alone were calculated, and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated.ResultsAmong the 300 women included in the randomized clinical trial (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [6.2] years), mean costs were similar for groups receiving mifepristone pretreatment and misoprostol alone from the health care sector perspective ($696.75 [95% CI, $591.88-$801.62] vs $690.88 [95% CI, $562.38-$819.38]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.94) and the societal perspective ($3846.30 [95% CI, $2783.01-$4909.58] vs $4845.62 [95% CI, $3186.84-$6504.41]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.32). The mifepristone pretreatment group had higher QALYs (0.0820 [95% CI, 0.0815-0.0825] vs 0.0806 [95% CI, 0.0800-0.0812]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.001) and a higher completion rate after first treatment (83.8% vs 67.1%; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) than the group receiving misoprostol alone. From the health care sector perspective, mifepristone pretreatment was cost-effective relative to misoprostol alone with an ICER of $4225.43 (95% CI, -$195 053.30 to $367 625.10) per QALY gained. From the societal perspective, mifepristone pretreatment dominated misoprostol alone (95% CI, -$5â€¯111â€¯629 to $1â€¯801â€¯384). The probabilities that mifepristone pretreatment was cost-effective compared with misoprostol alone at a willingness-to-pay of $150â€¯000 per QALY gained from the health care sector and societal perspectives were approximately 90% and 80%, respectively.Conclusions and relevanceThis study found that medical management of EPL with mifepristone pretreatment was cost-effective when compared with misoprostol alone.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02012491."

Despite potential heterogeneous infection levels across a country, countries receiving allotments of vaccines may follow WHO's allocation guidelines and distribute vaccines based on a jurisdictions' relative population size. Utilizing economic-epidemiological modeling, we benchmark the performance of this pro rata allocation rule by comparing it to an optimal one that minimizes the economic damages and expenditures over time, including a penalty representing the social costs of deviating from the pro rata strategy. The pro rata rule performs better when the duration of naturally- and vaccine-acquired immunity is short, when there is population mixing, when the supply of vaccine is high, and when there is minimal heterogeneity in demographics. Despite behavioral and epidemiological uncertainty diminishing the performance of the optimal allocation, it generally outperforms the pro rata vaccine distribution rule."

Existing research provides insufficient evidence to support this belief, however, largely because of limitations in the data and methodologies that researchers have used. The research described moves beyond a simple test of correlations to an exploration of how urban form fits into a more comprehensive model of choices about pedestrian trips. First, a model for individual choices about pedestrian trips is proposed. Second, the results of a study of six neighborhoods in Austin, Texas, are presented. Data from a survey of residents in these neighborhoods support the proposed model and suggest that certain aspects of urban form can play an important role in encouraging walks to a destination but that the savings in travel from the substitution of walking for driving is likely to be small."

However, robust inferences continue to be hampered by low detection of rare and elusive species. Attractants can be used to increase detection rates, but may also alter behaviour, and little research has evaluated short-term, localized response to the presence of attractants. We conducted three camera trap surveys in Kibale National Park, Uganda, using food baits and scent lures (""attractants"") at each camera station to entice small carnivores to pass in front of camera stations. To examine the interrelationship between scavenging and response to attractants, we also placed camera traps at five food refuse pits. We modelled the effect of attractant and duration of trap placement on the detection probability of small carnivores and selected African golden cat Caracal aurata prey items. We examine transient site response of each species, by comparing our observed likelihood of detection in each 24 h period from 1-7 d following refreshing of attractants to randomly generated capture histories. African civet Civettictis civetta, rusty-spotted genet Genetta maculata, African palm civet Nandinia binotata, and marsh mongoose Atilax paludinosus detection probabilities were highest and Weyns's red duiker Cephalophus wenysi detection probability was lowest immediately after attractants were placed. Within 24 h after attractant was placed, rusty-spotted genet and African palm civet were more likely to be detected and African golden cat, red duiker, and blue duiker Philantomba monticola were less likely to be detected. Our results suggest that attractants can increase detection of small-bodied species and include some arboreal species in terrestrial camera trap sampling. However, attractants may also alter short-term visitation rates of some species, with potentially cascading effects on others. Community level and intraguild interaction studies should control for the potentially confounding effects of attractants on spatial activity patterns."

Many masses presenting to veterinary clinics are difficult to diagnose without using invasive, time-consuming, and costly tests. Our objective was to perform a preliminary proof-of-concept for the HT Vista device, a novel artificial intelligence-based thermal imaging system, developed and designed to differentiate benign from malignant, cutaneous and subcutaneous masses in dogs.MethodsForty-five dogs with a total of 69 masses were recruited. Each mass was clipped and heated by the HT Vista device. The heat emitted by the mass and its adjacent healthy tissue was automatically recorded using a built-in thermal camera. The thermal data from both areas were subsequently analyzed using an Artificial Intelligence algorithm. Cytology and/or biopsy results were later compared to the results obtained from the HT Vista system and used to train the algorithm. Validation was done using a ""Leave One Out"" cross-validation to determine the algorithm's performance.ResultsThe accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the system were 90%, 93%, 88%, 83%, and 95%, respectively for all masses.ConclusionWe propose that this novel system, with further development, could be used to provide a decision-support tool enabling clinicians to differentiate between benign lesions and those requiring additional diagnostics. Our study also provides a proof-of-concept for ongoing prospective trials for cancer diagnosis using advanced thermodynamics and machine learning procedures in companion dogs."

We used latent class analysis (LCA) with two independent cohorts to understand how apathy and depression symptoms co-occur statistically. We further explored the relationship between latent class membership, demographics, and the presence of other NPS. The LCA identified a four-class solution (no symptoms, apathy, depression, and combined apathy/depression), reproducible over both cohorts, providing robust support for an apathy syndrome distinct from depression and confirming that an apathy/depression syndrome exists, supported by the model fit test with the four-class solution scores evidencing better fitting (Bayesian information criterion adjusted and entropy R 2). Using a data-driven method, we show distinct and statistically meaningful co-occurrence of apathy and depressive symptoms. There was evidence that these classes have different clinical associations, which may help inform diagnostic categories for research studies and clinical practice.HighlightsWe found four classes: no symptoms, apathy, depression and apathy/depression.Apathy conferred a higher probability for agitation.Apathy diagnostic criteria should include accompanying neuropsychiatric symptoms."

The two Border Collie reference panels comprised 808 individuals including 79 Border Collies and 426&nbsp;326 or 426&nbsp;332 SNPs; and the Italian Spinone reference panel comprised 807 individuals including 38 Italian Spinoni and 476&nbsp;313 SNPs. A high accuracy for imputation was observed, with the lowest accuracy observed for one of the Border Collie datasets (mean R2 &nbsp;=&nbsp;0.94) and the highest for the Italian Spinone dataset (mean R2 &nbsp;=&nbsp;0.97). This study's findings demonstrate that imputation of a legacy array study set using a reference panel comprising both breed-specific array data and multi-breed variant data derived from whole genomes is effective and accurate. The process of canine genotype imputation, using the valuable growing resource of publicly available canine genome variant datasets alongside breed-specific data, is described in detail to facilitate and encourage use of this technique in canine genetics."

Screen time is a risk factor for obesity, possibly because of the influence of food and beverage advertising on diet.ObjectiveWe sought to assess longitudinal relations of screen time [ie, television, electronic games, digital versatile discs (DVDs)/videos, and total screen time] with the 2-y changes in consumption of foods of low nutritional quality (FLNQ) that are commonly advertised on screens [ie, sugar-sweetened beverages, fast food, sweets, salty snacks, and the sum of these foods (total FLNQ)] and fruit and vegetables.DesignWith the use of 2004, 2006, and 2008 waves of the Growing Up Today Study II, which consisted of a cohort of 6002 female and 4917 male adolescents aged 9-16 y in 2004, we assessed screen time (change and baseline) in relation to the 2-y dietary changes. Regression models included 4604 girls and 3668 boys with complete screen time and diet data on â‰¥2 consecutive questionnaires.ResultsEach hour-per-day increase in television, electronic games, and DVDs/videos was associated with increased intake of total FLNQ (range: 0.10-0.28 servings/d; P < 0.05). Each hour-per-day increase in total screen time predicted increased intakes of sugar-sweetened beverages, fast food, sweets, and salty snacks (range: 0.02-0.06 servings/d; P < 0.001) and decreased intakes of fruit and vegetables (range: -0.05 to -0.02 servings/d; P < 0.05). Greater screen time at baseline (except electronic games in boys) was associated with subsequent increased intake of total FLNQ, and greater screen time at baseline (except DVDs/videos) was associated with decreased intake of fruit and vegetables (P < 0.05). Across sex and food groups and in sensitivity analyses, television was most consistently associated with dietary changes.ConclusionsIncreases in screen time were associated with increased consumption of foods and beverages of low nutritional quality and decreased consumption of fruit and vegetables. Our results caution against excessive use of screen media, especially television, in youth."

Bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) knockout (KO) mice develop metabolic liver diseases that progress into cancer as they age, which is accelerated by Western diet (WD) intake. The current study uncovers the molecular signatures for diet and age-linked metabolic liver disease development in an FXR-dependent manner.MethodsWild-type (WT) and FXR KO male mice, either on a healthy control diet (CD) or a WD, were euthanized at the ages of 5, 10, or 15â€‰months. Hepatic transcriptomics, liver, serum, and urine metabolomics as well as microbiota were profiled.ResultsWD intake facilitated hepatic aging in WT mice. In an FXR-dependent manner, increased inflammation and reduced oxidative phosphorylation were the primary pathways affected by WD and aging. FXR has a role in modulating inflammation and B cell-mediated humoral immunity which was enhanced by aging. Moreover, FXR dictated neuron differentiation, muscle contraction, and cytoskeleton organization in addition to metabolism. There were 654 transcripts commonly altered by diets, ages, and FXR KO, and 76 of them were differentially expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and healthy livers. Urine metabolites differentiated dietary effects in both genotypes, and serum metabolites clearly separated ages irrespective of diets. Aging and FXR KO commonly affected amino acid metabolism and TCA cycle. Moreover, FXR is essential for colonization of age-related gut microbes. Integrated analyses uncovered metabolites and bacteria linked with hepatic transcripts affected by WD intake, aging, and FXR KO as well as related to HCC patient survival.ConclusionFXR is a&nbsp;target to prevent diet or age-associated metabolic disease. The uncovered metabolites and microbes can be diagnostic markers for metabolic disease."

Interviews were conducted in person and online from October 16, 2019, to March 27, 2020, and analyzed from October 2019 to March 2021.Main outcomes and measuresParticipant experiences with barriers to and advances in diversity, equity, and inclusion.ResultsAmong 39 participants from 37 medical schools, admissions experience ranged from 1 to 40 years. Overall, 56.4% of participants identified as women, 10.3% as Asian American, 25.6% as Black or African American, 5.1% as Hispanic or Latinx, and 61.5% as White (participants could report >1 race and/or ethnicity). Participants characterized diversity broadly, with limited attention to racial injustice. Barriers to advancing racial and ethnic diversity included lack of leadership commitment; pressure from faculty and administrators to overemphasize academic scores and school rankings; and political and social influences, such as donors and alumni. Accreditation requirements, holistic review initiatives, and local policy motivated reforms but may also have inadvertently lowered expectations and accountability. Strategies to overcome challenges included narrative change and revision of school leadership structure, admissions goals, practices, and committee membership.Conclusions and relevanceIn this qualitative study, admissions leaders characterized the ways in which entrenched beliefs, practices, and power structures in medical schools may perpetuate institutional racism, with far-reaching implications for health equity. Participants offered insights on how to remove inequitable structures and implement process changes. Without such action, calls for racial justice will likely remain performative, and racism across health care institutions will continue."
"SKINNER, Debra J",The Arabidopsis INNER NO OUTER (INO) gene acts exclusively and quantitatively in regulation of ovule outer integument development,"The INNER NO OUTER (INO) gene is essential for formation of the outer integument of ovules in Arabidopsis thaliana. Initially described lesions in INO were missense mutations resulting in aberrant mRNA splicing. To determine the null mutant phenotype, we generated&nbsp;frameshift mutations and found, in confirmation of results on another recently identified frameshift mutation, that such mutants have a phenotype identical to the most severe splicing mutant (ino-1), with effects specific to outer integument development. We show that the altered protein of an ino mRNA splicing mutant with a less severe phenotype (ino-4) does not have INO activity, and the mutant is partial because it produces a small amount of correctly spliced INO mRNA. Screening for suppressors of ino-4 in a fast neutron-mutagenized population identified a translocated duplication of the ino-4 gene, leading to an increase in the amount of this mRNA. The increased expression led to a decrease in the severity of the mutant effects, indicating that the amount of INO activity quantitatively regulates outer integument growth. The results further confirm that the role of INO in Arabidopsis development is specific to the outer integument of ovules where it quantitatively affects the growth of this structure."

"THOMASY, Sara M",Effect of graphene-based nanomaterials on corneal wound healing in vitro,"Graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs) are widely used due to their chemical and physical properties for multiple commercial and environmental applications. From an occupational health perspective, there is concern regarding the effects of inhalation on the respiratory system, and many studies have been conducted to study inhalation impacts on lung. Similar to the respiratory system, the eyes may also be exposed to GBNs and thus impacted. In this study, immortalized human corneal epithelial (hTCEpi) cells and rabbit corneal fibroblasts (RCFs) were used to investigate the toxicity of eight types of GBN: graphene oxide (GO; 400&nbsp;nm), GO (1&nbsp;Î¼m), partially reduced graphene oxide (PRGO; 400&nbsp;nm), reduced graphene oxide (RGO; 400&nbsp;nm), RGO (2&nbsp;Î¼m), graphene (110&nbsp;nm), graphene (140&nbsp;nm), and graphene (1&nbsp;Î¼m). We next examined the effects of these GBNs on hTCEpi cell migration. We also determined whether the expression of Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±SMA), a myofibroblast marker, is altered by the GBNs using RCFs. We found that RGO (400&nbsp;nm) and RGO (2&nbsp;Î¼m) were highly toxic to hTCEPi cells and RCFs meanwhile, PRGO (400&nbsp;nm) was toxic only to hTCEpi cells. In addition, PRGO (400&nbsp;nm), RGO (400&nbsp;nm), and RGO (2&nbsp;Î¼m) inhibited hTCEpi cell migration and significantly increased Î±SMA mRNA expression. Further study in vivo is required to determine if RGO nanomaterials delay corneal epithelial healing and induce scar formation."
"BAUMLER, Andreas J",Predicting the Next Superspreader,"The spread of multidrug-resistant zoonotic pathogens, such as Salmonella, within livestock is of concern for food safety. The spread of Salmonella on the farm is escalated by superspreaders, which shed the pathogen at high numbers with their feces. However, there are currently no biomarkers to identify potential superspreaders. Kempf and coworkers determined that a potent early inflammatory response to Salmonella infection and changes in the microbiota composition are associated with the superspreader phenotype in pigs (F. Kempf, G. Cordoni, A.M. ChaussÃ©, R. Drumo, et al., mSystems, in press, https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00852-22). Since these biomarkers only develop during Salmonella infection, additional work is needed to predict animals that have the potential to become superspreaders."

The discovery of carcinogenic and genotoxic N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) in processed meat products has had serious negative impacts on the meat industry. In order to clarify the relationship between the use of nitrite or nitrate and the safety of meat or meat products, we reviewed NOCs in meat and meat products, the origin and safety implications of NOCs, effects of nitrite and nitrate on meat quality, national regulations, recent publications concerning the using of nitrite and nitrate in meat or meat products, and reduction methods. By comparing and analyzing references, (1) we found antioxidant, flavor improvement and shelf-life extension effects were recently proposed functions of nitrite and nitrate on meat quality, (2) the multiple functions of nitrite and nitrate in meat and meat products couldn't be fully replaced by other food additives at present, (3) we observed that the residual nitrite in raw meat and fried meat products was not well monitored, (4) alternative additives seem to be the most successful methods of replacing nitrite in meat processing, currently. The health risks of consuming processed meat products should be further evaluated, and more effective methods or additives for replacing nitrite or nitrate are needed."

We used a path analysis to test effects of SES, neighborhood safety, and physical activity on mental health and SRH.ResultsLow SES was associated with greater neighborhood safety concerns, which were negatively associated with physical activity, which was then negatively related to mental health and SRH. This model was similar across different racial/ethnic and gender groups, but mean levels in the constructs differed across groups.ConclusionsSES plays an important role in SRH and mental health, and this effect is further nuanced by race/ethnicity and gender. Identifying the psychological (neighborhood safety) and behavioral (physical activity) factors that influence mental health and SRH is critical for tailoring interventions and designing programs that can improve overall health."

"GIORDANI, Mauro",Intravenous Tranexamic Acid Versus Topical Aminocaproic Acid: Which Method Has the Least Blood Loss and Transfusion Rates?,"IntroductionSince the advent of antifibrinolytics, blood transfusions and their associated complications in total joint arthroplasty have decreased. Few studies have compared different antifibrinolytic types with respect to blood loss and transfusion rates. We sought to compare the blood loss and transfusion rates between epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA), tranexamic acid (TXA), and control.MethodsA total of 564 patients underwent primary total hip or total knee arthroplasty at our institution. Patients were divided into 3 groups: 183 EACA, 204 TXA, and 177 control. Patient demographics, hemoglobin, transfusion rates, and blood loss were collected.ResultsPatient preoperative variables were similar. The control group had a mean estimated blood loss (EBL) of 1.48 L, with 51 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) given and 14.7% of patients receiving a blood transfusion. The EACA group had an EBL of 1.33 L, with 20 pRBCs given and 10.9% of patients receiving a transfusion. The TXA group had an EBL of 1.05 L, with 3 pRBCs transfused in 0.98% of patients. Compared with the control group, blood loss (P = 0.0014; P < 0.0001), number of pRBCs given (P = 0.007; P < 0.0001), and number of patients transfused (P = 0.012; P < 0.0001) were significantly lower in the EACA and TXA groups, respectively. TXA had significantly lower blood loss (P < 0.0001), lower number of tranfusions (P = 0.005), and less patients transfused (P = 0.003) compared with EACA.ConclusionOur study reports lower blood loss, transfusion rates, and number of patients needing transfusion with both EACA and TXA in the setting of total joint arthroplasty. When comparing between EACA and TXA, TXA had lower blood loss, transfusion rates, and number of patients requiring transfusion."

We sought to examine predictors of nonadherence in a multicenter randomized trial of 971 children with acute gastroenteritis receiving a 5-day oral course of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or placebo. Adherence, defined as consuming all doses of the product, was reported by the parents and recorded during daily follow-up contacts. Of 943 patients with follow-up data, 766 (81.2%) were adherent. On multivariate analysis, older age (OR 1.19; 95% CI: 1.00-1.43), increased vomiting duration (OR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.05-1.45), higher dehydration score (OR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07-1.42), and hospitalization following ED discharge (OR 4.16, 95% CI: 1.21--14.30) were factors associated with nonadherence; however, those with highest severity scores were more likely to adhere (OR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80-0.95).

surveys depends not only on the quality of the flux data, but also on a number
of modeling assumptions that enter into both the training set and SED fitting
methods of photometric redshift estimation. In this work we focus on the
latter, considering two types of modeling uncertainties: uncertainties in the
SED template set and uncertainties in the magnitude and type priors used in a
Bayesian photometric redshift estimation method. We find that SED template
selection effects dominate over magnitude prior errors. We introduce a method

"PAVANKUMAR, Theetha L","Inteins: Localized Distribution, Gene Regulation, and Protein Engineering for Biological Applications","Inteins are self-splicing polypeptides with an ability to excise themselves from flanking host protein regions with remarkable precision; in the process, they ligate flanked host protein fragments. Inteins are distributed sporadically across all three domains of life (bacteria, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes). However, their apparent localized distribution in DNA replication, repair, and recombination proteins (the 3Rs), particularly in bacteria and archaea, is enigmatic. Our understanding of the localized distribution of inteins in the 3Rs, and their possible regulatory role in such distribution, is still only partial. Nevertheless, understanding the chemistry of post-translational self-splicing of inteins has opened up opportunities for protein chemists to modify, manipulate, and bioengineer proteins. Protein-splicing technology is adapted to a wide range of applications, starting with untagged protein purification, site-specific protein labeling, protein biotinylation, isotope incorporation, peptide cyclization, as an antimicrobial target, and so on. This review is focused on the chemistry of splicing; the localized distribution of inteins, particularly in the 3Rs and their possible role in regulating host protein function; and finally, the use of protein-splicing technology in various protein engineering applications."

Interferometric diffuse optics (iDO) promises to improve the quantitative accuracy and depth specificity of DO, and particularly, coherent light fluctuations (CLFs) arising from blood flow. iDO techniques have alternatively achieved either time-of-flight (TOF) discrimination or highly parallel detection, but not both at once. Here, we break this barrier with a single iDO instrument. Specifically, we show that rapid tuning of a temporally coherent laser during the sensor integration time increases the effective linewidth seen by a highly parallel interferometer. Using this concept to create a continuously variable and user-specified TOF filter, we demonstrate a solution to the canonical problem of DO, measuring optical properties. Then, with a deep TOF filter, we reduce scalp sensitivity of CLFs by 2.7 times at 1 cm source-collector separation. With this unique combination of desirable features, i.e., TOF-discrimination, spatial localization, and highly parallel CLF detection, we perform multiparametric imaging of light intensities and CLFs via the human forehead."
"BLOZIS VILLARREAL, Shelley A",Selected health behaviors moderate the progression of functional limitations in persons with multiple sclerosis: Eleven years of annual&nbsp;follow-up,"BackgroundMultiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic neurological disease typically diagnosed in young adulthood, presents with a wide variety of symptoms, impairments and functional limitations. Given the chronic, unpredictable and long-term nature of this disease, preserving function is essential.ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to identify psychosocial and behavioral factors that might influence the trajectory of functional limitation through eleven years of longitudinal follow-up of a sample of persons with MS.MethodsParticipants (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;606) completed measures of health behaviors, related constructs and functional limitations annually over eleven years. Longitudinal measures of functional limitations were analyzed using random-effects regression that allows for study of individual differences in the trajectories of a measure. Using the best fitting quadratic growth model, we tested the within and between-person effects of Nutrition, Interpersonal Relationships, Exercise, Stress Management, Health Responsibilities, Spiritual Growth, Self-rated Health and Barriers, controlling for Age, Year since Diagnosis and Year of Dropout, on Functional Limitations in the 11th year.ResultsAfter adjusting for covariates, higher mean scores for Exercise and Self-rated Health were related to lower levels of Functional Limitations in Year 11. Higher mean scores for Stress Management, Health Responsibilities and Barriers were related to higher levels of Functional Limitations in Year 11. Higher mean Exercise scores and lower mean Health Responsibilities scores were related to slower rates of progression of functional limitations in Year&nbsp;11.ConclusionFindings suggest that the highly variable trajectory of functional limitations in MS may be extended and shaped through health behavior strategies."

"LEE, Jee-Yon",Serum chemerin levels are independently associated with quality of life in colorectal cancer survivors: A pilot study,"BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) survivors are known to experience various symptoms that significantly affect their quality of life (QOL); therefore, it is important to identify clinical markers related with CRC survivor QOL. Here we investigated the relationship between serum chemerin levels, a newly identified proinflammatory adipokine, and QOL in CRC survivors.MethodsA data of total of 110 CRC survivors were analysed in the study. Serum chemerin levels were measured with an enzyme immunoassay analyser. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) scores were used as an indicator of QOL in CRC survivors.ResultsWeak but not negligible relationships were observed between serum chemerin levels and FACT-General (G) (r = -0.22, p<0.02), FACT-Colorectal cancer (C) (r = -0.23, p<0.02) and FACT-Fatigue (F) scores (r = -0.27, p<0.01) after adjusting for confounding factors. Both stepwise and enter method multiple linear regression analyses confirmed that serum chemerin levels were independently associated with FACT-G (stepwise: Î² = -0.15, p<0.01; enter: Î² = -0.12, p = 0.02), FACT-C (stepwise: Î² = -0.19, p<0.01; enter; Î² = -0.14, p = 0.02) and FACT-F scores (stepwise: Î² = -0.23, p<0.01; enter: Î² = -0.20, p<0.01).ConclusionsOur results demonstrate a weak inverse relationship between serum chemerin and CRC survivor QOL. Although it is impossible to determine causality, our findings suggest that serum chemerin levels may have a significant association with CRC survivor QOL. Further prospective studies are required to confirm the clinical significance of our pilot study."

We also prove that given sufficient information the empirical distributions of the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUP) of random effects, again with REML-estimated variance components, converge to the true distributions of the corresponding random effects. As a consequence, we obtain a consistent estimate of the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of the REML estimates. The results require neither that the data is normally distributed nor that the model is hierarchical (nested)."
"MOSHIRI, Ala",Real-World Experience Using Intravitreal Brolucizumab Alone or in Combination with Aflibercept in the Management of Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"PurposeTo evaluate real-world experience using intravitreal brolucizumab (IVBr), alone or in combination with aflibercept, in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) treated previously with other inhibitors of VEGF (anti-VEGF).MethodsThis was a retrospective study of all eyes with nAMD treated with IVBr on a treat-and-extend protocol at a single center. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), optical coherence tomography (OCT) at baseline and final visit, and drug-related adverse events were analyzed. Eyes with recurrent macular fluid on IVBr every 8 weeks were treated with a combination therapy alternating between IVBr and aflibercept every month.ResultsAmong 52 eyes (40 patients) on IVBr, all had been previously treated with other anti-VEGF therapy, with 73% having persistent macular fluid. After a mean follow-up of 46.2Â±27.4 weeks on IVBr, the mean treatment interval for intravitreal therapy increased to 8.8Â±2.1 weeks on IVBr from a baseline of 6.1Â±3.1 weeks (p<0.001). Macular fluid decreased and BCVA was stable/improved in 61.5% of eyes on IVBr. Ten eyes with increased macular fluid on IVBr monotherapy when extended to every 8 weeks were treated with combination therapy alternating between IVBr and aflibercept every 4 weeks. In these eyes, 80% had improved macular fluid on OCT and 70% stable or improved BCVA after a median follow-up of 53 weeks on combination therapy. Mild intraocular inflammation developed in four eyes, all occurring on IVBr monotherapy, and none had associated vision loss.ConclusionIn the real world, IVBr used to treat eyes with nAMD previously treated with other anti-VEGF therapies appears to be well tolerated and associated with an improvement in macular fluid, stabilization of BCVA, and/or increase in intravitreal treatment interval. Combination therapy alternating between IVBr and aflibercept monthly appears to be well tolerated and can be considered for eyes with macular fluid on IVBr every 8 weeks."

We examined the association between early-life SES and adversity and late-life cross-sectional cognitive outcomes as well as global cognitive decline, hypothesizing that adulthood SES would mediate these associations.MethodsOur sample (N = 837) was a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of non-Hispanic/Latino White (48%), Black (27%), and Hispanic/Latino (19%) participants from Northern California. Participant addresses were geocoded to the level of the census tract, and US Census Tract 2010 variables (e.g., percent with high school diploma) were extracted and combined to create a neighborhood SES composite. We used multilevel latent variable models to estimate early-life (e.g., parental education, whether participant ever went hungry) and adult (participant's education, main occupation) SES factors and their associations with cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive outcomes of episodic memory, semantic memory, executive function, and spatial ability.ResultsChild and adult factors were strongly related to domain-specific cognitive intercepts (0.20-0.48 SD per SD of SES factor); in contrast, SES factors were not related to global cognitive change (0.001-0.01 SD per year per SD of SES factor). Adulthood SES mediated a large percentage (68-75%) of the total early-life effect on cognition.ConclusionsEarly-life sociocontextual factors are more strongly associated with cross-sectional late-life cognitive performance compared to cognitive change; this effect is largely mediated through associations with adulthood SES."

Here, we assess the cardiopulmonary safety of intravenous ALLO by itself and after a clinically recommended dose of midazolam (MDZ) in two healthy adult beagles. Each dog received ALLO (1â€‰mg/kg, IV), and after a washout period of 2 weeks, each dog was dosed with MDZ (0.2â€‰mg/kg, IV) followed 10â€‰minutes later by ALLO. Behavioral state, vital signs, arterial blood gases, blood chemistries, and plasma ALLO concentrations were monitored for up to 6â€‰hours after dosing. The dogs appeared sleepy but were fully responsive after both treatments. No depression of mean arterial pressure or respiratory rate was noted. Blood gas measurements failed to show evidence of drug-induced acute respiratory acidosis. Estimated maximum plasma ALLO concentrations were in the range of 1500 to 3000â€‰ng/ml. The results indicate that intravenous ALLO can be used safely to treat benzodiazepine-refractory SE, even when administered shortly after a benzodiazepine."

"KEEL, Michael K",Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Vasculopathy in a Syrian Golden Hamster Model,"Clinical evidence of vascular dysfunction and hypercoagulability as well as pulmonary vascular damage and microthrombosis are frequently reported in severe cases of human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Syrian golden hamsters recapitulate histopathologic pulmonary vascular lesions reported in patients with COVID-19. Herein, special staining techniques and transmission electron microscopy further define vascular pathologies in a Syrian golden hamster model of human COVID-19. The results show that regions of active pulmonary inflammation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are characterized by ultrastructural evidence of endothelial damage with platelet marginalization and both perivascular and subendothelial macrophage infiltration. SARS-CoV-2 antigen/RNA was not detectable within affected blood vessels. Taken together, these findings suggest that the prominent microscopic vascular lesions in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated hamsters likely occur due to endothelial damage followed by platelet and macrophage infiltration."

A database search of Pubmed/Medline, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost was performed from inception to June 2022. A random-effects model was chosen for this meta-analysis. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed throughout this study. Seven studies met study criteria (2215 patients). The risk ratio was significantly higher for margins <5â€‰mm when compared to those â‰¥5â€‰mm (2.09 (95%CI: 1.53-2.86, I2 &nbsp;=â€‰0.47)). Subgroup analysis (I2 &nbsp;=&nbsp;0.15) of margin distances of 0.0-0.9, 1.0-1.9, 2.0-2.9, 3.0-3.9, and 4.0-4.9â€‰mm calculated risk ratios for local recurrence of 2.96, 2.01, 2.17, 1.8, and 0.98, respectively.

They also independently (yet presciently) understood that a major contemporary encumbrance for systems of clinical care delivery is the care of â€œcomplex patientsâ€ and the associated â€œcomplex cases.â€ These are the patients who are â€œeveryoneâ€™sâ€ patient, yet â€œno oneâ€™sâ€ patient. These are patients who â€œdo not get much better and rarely go away.â€ The antidote for their suffering transcends medical specialty. Thus, they cannot be pigeonholed as â€œinternal medicine patientsâ€ or â€œpsychiatric patients.â€ As such, a collaborative approach for patient management involving collegial support for and among the treating physicians is an optimum approach."

"BROWN, Titus",Hsp90 and hepatobiliary transformation during sea lamprey metamorphosis,"BackgroundBiliary atresia (BA) is a human infant disease with inflammatory fibrous obstructions in the bile ducts and is the most common cause for pediatric liver transplantation. In contrast, the sea lamprey undergoes developmental BA with transient cholestasis and fibrosis during metamorphosis, but emerges as a fecund adult. Therefore, sea lamprey liver metamorphosis may serve as an etiological model for human BA and provide pivotal information for hepatobiliary transformation and possible therapeutics.ResultsWe hypothesized that liver metamorphosis in sea lamprey is due to transcriptional reprogramming that dictates cellular remodeling during metamorphosis. We determined global gene expressions in liver at several metamorphic landmark stages by integrating mRNA-Seq and gene ontology analyses, and validated the results with real-time quantitative PCR, histological and immunohistochemical staining. These analyses revealed that gene expressions of protein folding chaperones, membrane transporters and extracellular matrices were altered and shifted during liver metamorphosis. HSP90, important in protein folding and invertebrate metamorphosis, was identified as a candidate key factor during liver metamorphosis in sea lamprey. Blocking HSP90 with geldanamycin facilitated liver metamorphosis and decreased the gene expressions of the rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis, HMGCoA reductase (hmgcr), and bile acid biosynthesis, cyp7a1. Injection of hsp90 siRNA for 4 days altered gene expressions of met, hmgcr, cyp27a1, and slc10a1. Bile acid concentrations were increased while bile duct and gall bladder degeneration was facilitated and synchronized after hsp90 siRNA injection.ConclusionsHSP90 appears to play crucial roles in hepatobiliary transformation during sea lamprey metamorphosis. Sea lamprey is a useful animal model to study postembryonic development and mechanisms for hsp90-induced hepatobiliary transformation."

We aimed to define the genetic architecture of functional variants associated with PAH disease severity by identifying allele-specific binding transcription factors and downstream targets that control endothelial pathophenotypes and PAH. Methods and Results Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of oligonucleotides containing SNP rs2856830 and 8 SNPs in linkage disequilibrium revealed functional SNPs via allele-imbalanced binding to human pulmonary arterial endothelial cell nuclear proteins. DNA pulldown proteomics identified SNP-binding proteins. SNP genotyping and clinical correlation analysis were performed in 84 patients with PAH at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and in 679 patients with PAH in the All of Us database. SNP rs9277336 was identified as a functional SNP in linkage disequilibrium (r2>0.8) defined by rs2856830, and the minor allele was associated with decreased hospitalizations and improved cardiac output in patients with PAH, an index of disease severity. SNP pulldown proteomics showed allele-specific binding of nuclear ACTN4 (alpha actinin 4) protein to rs9277336 minor allele. Both ACTN4 and HLA-DPA1 were downregulated in pulmonary endothelium in human patients and rodent models of PAH. Via transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses, knockdown of HLA-DPA1 phenocopied knockdown of ACTN4, both similarly controlling cell structure pathways, immune pathways, and endothelial dysfunction. Conclusions We defined the pathogenic activity of functional SNP rs9277336, entailing the allele-specific binding of ACTN4 and controlling expression of the neighboring HLA-DPA1 gene. Through inflammatory or genetic means, downregulation of this ACTN4-HLA-DPA1 regulatory axis promotes endothelial pathophenotypes, providing a mechanistic explanation for the association between this SNP and PAH outcomes."

On the other hand, the ""free-floating"" sign has been associated with neoplasms, for example, dermatofibroma and interstitial mycosis fungoides. Herein, we report the Free Sign in sclerosing skin disorders.MethodsIn a case-control study, we applied detailed histopathologic definitions of Floating Sign and Free Sign to assess their presence in morphea, IGD, and other sclerosing disorders.ResultsFree Sign was present in most cases of morphea (46/55, 84%) and IGD (7/13, 54%) but not necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) (6/14, 42.8%) or sclerodermoid graft versus host disease (SGVHD) (2/7, 28.5%). The sensitivity and specificity of Free Sign for morphea versus other disorders was 84% and 56%, respectively. Floating Sign was not identified in most cases: NL (3/14, 21.4%), SGVHD (1/7, 14.2%), morphea (5/55, 9%), IGD (1/13, 7.7%). The diagnostic sensitivity of Floating Sign in morphea was 9%.ConclusionsThe Free Sign was present in most cases of morphea in our series and may represent a clue to the presence of evolving sclerosis. Free Sign may be seen in other sclerosing disorders. Technical artifact is a potential cause of a false-positive Free Sign."
"CREININ, Mitchell D",Management of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies at an academic referral center: A case series,"ObjectivesTo describe treatment and outcomes of patients with confirmed cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy (CSEP) at a tertiary referral center.Study designWe reviewed a deidentified family planning clinical database for patients seen by our subspecialty service for CSEP from January 2017 through December 2021 in this case series. We extracted referral information, final diagnosis, management, and outcome measures including estimated blood loss, secondary procedures, and treatment complications.ResultsOf 57 cases referred for suspected CSEPs, 23 (40%) had confirmed diagnoses; one additional case was diagnosed during clinic evaluation for early pregnancy loss. Most (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;50 [88%]) referrals occurred in the last 2 years of the 5-year study period. Of 24 confirmed CSEP cases, eight were pregnancy losses at the time of diagnosis. Fourteen cases were â‰¤50 days gestation or gestational size (7 [50%] pregnancy losses) and 10&nbsp;>50 days gestation (range 39-66 days). We treated all 14 patients â‰¤50 days primarily with suction aspiration under ultrasound guidance in an operating room with no complications and estimated blood loss of 14&nbsp;Â±&nbsp;10&nbsp;mL. Of the 10&nbsp;patients>50 days (maximum 66 days), seven were managed with primary aspiration of which five were uncomplicated. We treated one patient (57 days) had primary intrauterine double-catheter balloon with immediate hemorrhage requiring uterine artery embolization followed by an uncomplicated suction aspiration.ConclusionsPatients with confirmed CSEPs at 50 days or less gestation or gestational size can likely be primarily treated with suction aspiration with low risk for significant adverse outcomes. Treatment success and complications are directly related to gestational age at treatment.ImplicationsUltrasound-guided suction aspiration monotherapy should be considered for primary CSEP treatment up to 50 days and, with continued experience, may be reasonable beyond 50 days gestation. Invasive treatments or those that require multiple days and visits, such as methotrexate or balloon catheters, are not necessary for early CSEPs."

Using a mosquito surveillance program in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) and San Antonio, TX, from 2016 to 2018, we detected the presence of an insect-specific virus, cell fusing agent virus (CFAV), in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population. We tested 6,326 females and 1,249 males from the LRGV and 659 females from San Antonio for CFAV by RT-PCR using specific primers. Infection rates varied from 0 to 261 per 1,000 mosquitoes in the LRGV and 115 to 208 per 1,000 in San Antonio depending on the month of collection. Infection rates per 1,000 individuals appeared higher in females collected from BG Sentinel 2 traps compared to Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps, but the ratio of the percentage of infected pools did not differ by trap type. The natural viral load in individual males ranged from 1.25 x 102 to 5.50 x 106 RNA copies and in unfed females from 5.42 x 103 to 8.70 x 106 RNA copies. Gravid females were found to harbor fewer viral particles than males and unfed females."

"DAWSON, Scott C",Highly contiguous genomes of human clinical isolates of Giardia duodenalis reveal assemblage- and sub-assemblage-specific presenceâ€“absence variation in protein-coding genes,"Giardia duodenalis (syn. G. intestinalis, G. lamblia) is a widespread gastrointestinal protozoan parasite with debated taxonomic status. Currently, eight distinct genetic sub-groups, termed assemblages A-H, are defined based on a few genetic markers. Assemblages A and B may represent distinct species and are both of human public health relevance. Genomic studies are scarce and the few reference genomes available, in particular for assemblage B, are insufficient for adequate comparative genomics. Here, by combining long- and short-read sequences generated by PacBio and Illumina sequencing technologies, we provide nine annotated genome sequences for reference from new clinical isolates (four assemblage A and five assemblage B parasite isolates). Isolates chosen represent the currently accepted classification of sub-assemblages AI, AII, BIII and BIV. Synteny over the whole genome was generally high, but we report chromosome-level translocations as a feature that distinguishes assemblage A from B parasites. Orthologue gene group analysis was used to define gene content differences between assemblage A and B and to contribute a gene-set-based operational definition of respective taxonomic units. Giardia is tetraploid, and high allelic sequence heterogeneity (ASH) for assemblage B vs. assemblage A has been observed so far. Noteworthy, here we report an extremely low ASH (0.002%) for one of the assemblage B isolates (a value even lower than the reference assemblage A isolate WB-C6). This challenges the view of low ASH being a notable feature that distinguishes assemblage A from B parasites, and low ASH allowed assembly of the most contiguous assemblage B genome currently available for reference. In conclusion, the description of nine highly contiguous genome assemblies of new isolates of G. duodenalis assemblage A and B adds to our understanding of the genomics and species population structure of this widespread zoonotic parasite."

"FIEHN, Oliver",Genome-wide analysis of oxylipins and oxylipin profiles in a pediatric population,"BackgroundOxylipins are inflammatory biomarkers derived from omega-3 and-6 fatty acids implicated in inflammatory diseases but have not been studied in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The aim of this study was to identify genetic loci associated with oxylipins and oxylipin profiles to identify biologic pathways and therapeutic targets for oxylipins.MethodsWe conducted a GWAS of plasma oxylipins in 316 participants in the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY). DNA samples were genotyped using the TEDDY-T1D Exome array, and additional variants were imputed using the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) multi-ancestry reference panel. Principal components analysis of 36 plasma oxylipins was used to capture oxylipin profiles. PC1 represented linoleic acid (LA)- and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)-related oxylipins, and PC2 represented arachidonic acid (ARA)-related oxylipins. Oxylipin PC1, PC2, and the top five loading oxylipins from each PC were used as outcomes in the GWAS (genome-wide significance: pâ€‰<â€‰5Ã—10-8).ResultsThe SNP rs143070873 was associated with (pâ€‰<â€‰5Ã—10-8) the LA-related oxylipin 9-HODE, and rs6444933 (downstream of CLDN11) was associated with the LA-related oxylipin 13â€‰S-HODE. A locus between MIR1302-7 and LOC100131146, rs10118380 and an intronic variant in TRPM3 were associated with the ARA-related oxylipin 11-HETE.

"FIEHN, Oliver",Longitudinal lipidomic signatures of all-cause and CVD mortality in American Indians: findings from the Strong Heart Study.,"Dyslipidemia is an independent and modifiable risk factor for aging and age-related disorders. Routine lipid panel cannot capture all individual lipid species in blood (i.e., blood lipidome). To date, a comprehensive assessment of the blood lipidome associated with mortality is lacking in large-scale community-dwelling individuals, especially in a longitudinal setting. Using liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry, we repeatedly measured individual lipid species in 3,821 plasma samples collected at two visits (~â€‰5.5&nbsp;years apart) from 1,930 unique American Indians in the Strong Heart Family Study. We first identified baseline lipids associated with risks for all-cause mortality and CVD mortality (mean follow-up period: 17.8&nbsp;years) in American Indians, followed by replication of top hits in European Caucasians in the MalmÃ¶ Diet and Cancer-Cardiovascular Cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰3,943, mean follow-up period: 23.7&nbsp;years). The model adjusted age, sex, BMI, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and LDL-c at baseline. We then examined the associations between changes in lipid species and risk of mortality. Multiple testing was controlled by false discovery rate (FDR). We found that baseline levels and longitudinal changes of multiple lipid species, e.g., cholesterol esters, glycerophospholipids, sphingomyelins, and triacylglycerols, were significantly associated with risks of all-cause or CVD mortality. Many lipids identified in American Indians could be replicated in European Caucasians. Network analysis identified differential lipid networks associated with risk of mortality. Our findings provide novel insight into the role of dyslipidemia in disease mortality and offer potential biomarkers for early prediction and risk reduction in American Indians and other ethnic groups."
"CREININ, Mitchell D",Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Treatment With a Levonorgestrel 52-mg Intrauterine Device,"ObjectiveTo evaluate heavy menstrual bleeding treatment outcomes with levonorgestrel 52-mg intrauterine device (IUD) use in participants without body mass index (BMI) or parity restrictions.MethodsInvestigators included participants aged 18-50 years with no pelvic or systemic pathology causing heavy menstrual bleeding at 29 U.S. centers in a prospective trial. Participants had up to three screening cycles with menstrual product collection for alkaline hematin blood-loss measurements. Investigators enrolled those with two menses with blood loss of 80 mL or more (values averaged for baseline blood loss), placed the IUD, and followed participants for up to six 28-day cycles. Participants collected any menstrual products used during cycles 3 and 6 for blood-loss measurement. We evaluated outcomes in participants with at least one follow-up assessment for the primary outcome of median absolute blood-loss change and, secondarily, treatment success , defined as the proportion with a final measured blood loss less than 80 mL and at least 50% reduction from baseline. We evaluated exploratory outcomes of differences in blood-loss changes by BMI and parity using Wilcoxon rank sum test.ResultsOf 105 enrolled participants, 47 (44.8%) had obesity (BMI 30.0 or higher) and 29 (27.6%) were nulliparous. Baseline mean blood loss ranged from 73 to 520 mL (median 143 mL, interquartile range 112-196 mL). Eighty-nine (84.8%) had at least one evaluable follow-up evaluation. Participants had median (interquartile range) absolute blood-loss decreases at cycles 3 (n=86) and 6 (n=81) of 93.3% (86.1-97.7%) and 97.6% (90.4-100%), respectively. At cycle 6, participants without obesity (n=43) and with obesity (n=38) had similar median [interquartile range] decreases (97.6% [91.8-100%] and 97.5% [90.3-100%], respectively; P =.89), with comparable findings for nulliparous (n=25) and parous (n=56) participants (97.0% [91.7-99.1%] and 98.1% [89.9-100%], respectively; P =.43). Treatment success occurred in 81.8% (95% CI 74.2-89.4%) of 99 participants, excluding those with no outcomes due to lost to follow-up or consent withdrawal, and did not vary by BMI or parity. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were bleeding or cramping (n=6 [5.7%]) and expulsion (n=5 [4.8%]).ConclusionThis levonorgestrel 52-mg IUD reduces blood loss by more than 90% over 6 months compared with baseline for most users with heavy menstrual bleeding.Funding sourceMedicines360.Clinical trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03642210."

Previous studies show that individuals with FXS exhibit changing behavior over time; therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the aberrant behavior profile of FXS individuals. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) was used to measure the aberrant behavior profile of individuals with FXS, which was rated by the parent/caregiver combined with clinical impression. A total of 58 items were used to assess aberrant behaviors across five subscales. Forty-nine individuals with FXS were included (32 males, 17 females) with a mean age of 32.9 Â± 14.62 years in males and 33.4 Â± 13.98 years in females. The average score of irritability and hyperactivity was significantly higher in male FXS individuals (5.37 Â± 6.231 and 10.28 Â± 8.524) than in female individuals (3.24 Â± 7.093 and 3.76 Â± 3.327) with p = 0.046 and p = 0.001, respectively. Overall irritability in FXS individuals significantly decreased over time (ÃŸ = -0.141; p = 0.032). A modest worsening in lethargy/social withdrawal in males across age and a gentle improvement in hyperactivity/noncompliance in male of FXS individuals were observed. FXS males had higher hyperactivity problems than FXS female individuals across age."

"LEMAY, Danielle G","Associations among Milk Microbiota, Milk Fatty Acids, Milk Glycans, and Inflammation from Lactating Holstein Cows","Milk oligosaccharides (MOs) can be prebiotic and antiadhesive, while fatty acids (MFAs) can be antimicrobial. Both have been associated with milk microbes or mammary gland inflammation in humans. Relationships between these milk components and milk microbes or inflammation have not been determined for cows and could help elucidate a novel approach for the dairy industry to promote desired milk microbial composition for improvement of milk quality and reduction of milk waste. We aimed to determine relationships among milk microbiota, MFAs, MOs, lactose, and somatic cell counts (SCC) from Holstein cows, using our previously published data. Raw milk samples were collected at three time points, ranging from early to late lactation. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects modeling and repeated-measures correlation. Unsaturated MFA and short-chain MFA had mostly negative relationships with potentially pathogenic genera, including Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, and an unknown Enterobacteriaceae genus but numerous positive relationships with symbionts Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides. Conversely, many MOs were positively correlated with potentially pathogenic genera (e.g., Corynebacterium, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas), and numerous MOs were negatively correlated with the symbiont Bifidobacterium. The neutral, nonfucosylated MO composed of eight hexoses had a positive relationship with SCC, while lactose had a negative relationship with SCC. One interpretation of these trends might be that in milk, MFAs disrupt primarily pathogenic bacterial cells, causing a relative increase in abundance of beneficial microbial taxa, while MOs respond to and act on pathogenic taxa primarily through antiadhesive methods. Further research is needed to confirm the potential mechanisms driving these correlations. IMPORTANCE Bovine milk can harbor microbes that cause mastitis, milk spoilage, and foodborne illness. Fatty acids found in milk can be antimicrobial and milk oligosaccharides can have antiadhesive, prebiotic, and immune-modulatory effects. Relationships among milk microbes, fatty acids, oligosaccharides, and inflammation have been reported for humans. To our knowledge, associations among the milk microbial composition, fatty acids, oligosaccharides, and lactose have not been reported for healthy lactating cows. Identifying these potential relationships in bovine milk will inform future efforts to characterize direct and indirect interactions of the milk components with the milk microbiota. Since many milk components are associated with herd management practices, determining if these milk components impact milk microbes may provide valuable information for dairy cow management and breeding practices aimed at minimizing harmful and spoilage-causing microbes in raw milk."

Although this miRNA family is hypothesized to play an essential role in differentiation, a triple knock-out (tKO) of the three genes has not been done to test this hypothesis. We report that tKO C2C12 myoblasts generated using CRISPR/Cas9 method differentiate despite the expected derepression of the miRNA targets. Surprisingly, their mitochondrial function is diminished. tKO mice demonstrate partial embryonic lethality, most likely due to the role of miR-1a in cardiac muscle differentiation. Two tKO mice survive and grow normally to adulthood with smaller myofiber diameter, diminished physical performance, and an increase in PAX7 positive satellite cells. Thus, unlike other miRNAs important in other differentiation pathways, the miR-206 family is not absolutely essential for myogenesis and is instead a modulator of optimal differentiation of skeletal myoblasts."

METHODS: We examined the clinical features and outcomes of 190 patients treated with ECMO within 14&nbsp;days of ICU admission, using data from a multicenter cohort study of 5122 critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to 68 hospitals across the United States. To estimate the effect of ECMO on mortality, we emulated a target trial of ECMO receipt versus no ECMO receipt within 7&nbsp;days of ICU admission among mechanically ventilated patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2â€‰<â€‰100). Patients were followed until hospital discharge, death, or a minimum of 60&nbsp;days. We adjusted for confounding using a multivariable Cox model. RESULTS: Among the 190 patients treated with ECMO, the median age was 49&nbsp;years (IQR 41-58), 137 (72.1%) were men, and the median PaO2/FiO2 prior to ECMO initiation was 72 (IQR 61-90). At 60&nbsp;days, 63 patients (33.2%) had died, 94 (49.5%) were discharged, and 33 (17.4%) remained hospitalized. Among the 1297 patients eligible for the target trial emulation, 45 of the 130 (34.6%) who received ECMO died, and 553 of the 1167 (47.4%) who did not receive ECMO died. In the primary analysis, patients who received ECMO had lower mortality than those who did not (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.41-0.74). Results were similar in a secondary analysis limited to patients with PaO2/FiO2â€‰<â€‰80 (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.40-0.77). CONCLUSION: In select patients with severe respiratory failure from COVID-19, ECMO may reduce mortality."

"BOONE, John M",Discrimination tasks in simulated low-dose CT noise.,"BACKGROUND: This study reports the results of a set of discrimination experiments using simulated images that represent the appearance of subtle lesions in low-dose computed tomography (CT) of the lungs. Noise in these images has a characteristic ramp-spectrum before apodization by noise control filters. We consider three specific diagnostic features that determine whether a lesion is considered malignant or benign, two system-resolution levels, and four apodization levels for a total of 24 experimental conditions. PURPOSE: The goal of the investigation is to better understand how well human observers perform subtle discrimination tasks like these, and the mechanisms of that performance. We use a forced-choice psychophysical paradigm to estimate observer efficiency and classification images. These measures quantify how effectively subjects can read the images, and how they use images to perform discrimination tasks across the different imaging conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The simulated CT images used as stimuli in the psychophysical experiments are generated from high-resolution objects passed through a modulation transfer function (MTF) before down-sampling to the image-pixel grid. Acquisition noise is then added with a ramp noise-power spectrum (NPS), with subsequent smoothing through apodization filters. The features considered are lesion size, indistinct lesion boundary, and a nonuniform lesion interior. System resolution is implemented by an MTF with resolution (10% max.) of 0.47 or 0.58 cyc/mm. Apodization is implemented by a Shepp-Logan filter (Sinc profile) with various cutoffs. Six medically naÃ¯ve subjects participated in the psychophysical studies, entailing training and testing components for each condition. Training consisted of staircase procedures to find the 80% correct threshold for each subject, and testing involved 2000 psychophysical trials at the threshold value for each subject. Human-observer performance is compared to the Ideal Observer to generate estimates of task efficiency. The significance of imaging factors is assessed using ANOVA. Classification images are used to estimate the linear template weights used by subjects to perform these tasks. Classification-image spectra are used to analyze subject weights in the spatial-frequency domain. RESULTS: Overall, average observer efficiency is relatively low in these experiments (10%-40%) relative to detection and localization studies reported previously. We find significant effects for feature type and apodization level on observer efficiency. Somewhat surprisingly, system resolution is not a significant factor. Efficiency effects of the different features appear to be well explained by the profile of the linear templates in the classification images. Increasingly strong apodization is found to both increase the classification-image weights and to increase the mean-frequency of the classification-image spectra. A secondary analysis of Unapodized classification images shows that this is largely due to observers undoing (inverting) the effects of apodization filters. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that human observers can be relatively inefficient at feature-discrimination tasks in ramp-spectrum noise. Observers appear to be adapting to frequency suppression implemented in apodization filters, but there are residual effects that are not explained by spatial weighting patterns. The studies also suggest that the mechanisms for improving performance through the application of noise-control filters may require further investigation."

"NUNO, Miriam A",The Efficacy of Cognitive Intervention in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI): a Meta-Analysis of Outcomes on Neuropsychological Measures,"Cognitive training in MCI may stimulate pre-existing neural reserves or recruit neural circuitry as ""compensatory scaffolding"" prompting neuroplastic reorganization to meet task demands (Reuter-Lorenz &amp; Park, 2014). However, existing systematic reviews and meta-analytic studies exploring the benefits of cognitive interventions in MCI have been mixed. An updated examination regarding the efficacy of cognitive intervention in MCI is needed given improvements in adherence to MCI diagnostic criteria in subject selection, better defined interventions and strategies applied, increased use of neuropsychological measures pre- and post-intervention, as well as identification of moderator variables which may influence treatment. As such, this meta-analytic review was conducted to examine the efficacy of cognitive intervention in individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus MCI controls based on performance of neuropsychological outcome measures in randomized controlled trials (RCT). RCT studies published from January 1995 to June 2017 were obtained through source databases of MEDLINE-R, PubMed, Healthstar, Global Health, PSYCH-INFO, and Health and Psychological Instruments using search parameters for MCI diagnostic category (mild cognitive impairment, MCI, pre-Alzheimer's disease, early cognitive decline, early onset Alzheimer's disease, and preclinical Alzheimer's disease) and the intervention or training conducted (intervention, training, stimulation, rehabilitation, or treatment). Other inclusion and exclusion criteria included subject selection based on established MCI criteria, RCT design in an outpatient setting, MCI controls (active or passive), and outcomes based on objective neuropsychological measures. From the 1199 abstracts identified, 26 articles met inclusion criteria for the meta-analyses completed across eleven (11) countries; 92.31% of which have been published within the past 7&nbsp;years. A series of meta-analyses were performed to examine the effects of cognitive intervention by cognitive domain, type of training, and intervention content (cognitive domain targeted). We found significant, moderate effects for multicomponent training (Hedges' g observedâ€‰=â€‰0.398; CI [0.164, 0.631]; Zâ€‰=â€‰3.337; pâ€‰=â€‰0.001; Qâ€‰=â€‰55.511; dfâ€‰=â€‰15; pâ€‰=â€‰0.000; I 2 â€‰=â€‰72.978%; Ï„ 2 â€‰=â€‰0.146) as well as multidomain-focused strategies (Hedges' gâ€‰=â€‰0.230; 95% CI [0.108, 0.352]; Zâ€‰=â€‰3.692; pâ€‰â€‰<&nbsp;0.001; Qâ€‰=â€‰12.713; dfâ€‰=â€‰12; pâ€‰=â€‰0.390; I 2 â€‰=â€‰5.612; Ï„ 2 â€‰=â€‰0.003). The effects for other interventions explored by cognitive domain, training type, or intervention content were indeterminate due to concerns for heterogeneity, bias, and small cell sizes. In addition, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted with the moderators of MCI category, mode of intervention, training type, intervention content, program duration (total hours), type of control group (active or passive), post-intervention follow-up assessment period, and control for repeat administration. We found significant overall effects for intervention content with memory focused interventions appearing to be more effective than multidomain approaches. There was no evidence of an influence on outcomes for the other covariates examined. Overall, these findings suggest individuals with MCI who received multicomponent training or interventions targeting multiple domains (including lifestyle changes) were apt to display an improvement on outcome measures of cognition post-intervention. As such, multicomponent and multidomain forms of intervention may prompt recruitment of alternate neural processes as well as support primary networks to meet task demands simultaneously. In addition, interventions with memory and multidomain forms of content appear to be particularly helpful, with memory-based approaches possibly being more effective than multidomain methods. Other factors, such as program duration, appear to have less of an influence on intervention outcomes. Given this, although the creation of new primary network paths appears strained in MCI, interventions with memory-based or multidomain forms of content may facilitate partial activation of compensatory scaffolding and neuroplastic reorganization. The positive benefit of memory-based strategies may also reflect transfer effects indicative of compensatory network activation and the multiple-pathways involved in memory processes. Limitations of this review are similar to other meta-analysis in MCI, including&nbsp;a modest number studies, small sample sizes, multiple forms of interventions and types of training applied (some overlapping), and, while greatly improved in our view, a&nbsp;large diversity of instruments used to measure outcome. This is apt to have contributed to the presence of heterogeneity and publication bias precluding a&nbsp;more definitive determination of the outcomes observed."

The pathogenesis of NEC remains incompletely understood, with no specific entity that unifies all infants that develop NEC. Therefore, investigators rely on animal models to manipulate variables and provide a means to test interventions, making them valuable tools to enhance our understanding and prevent and treat NEC. The advancements in molecular analytic tools, genetic manipulation, and imaging modalities and the emergence of scientific collaborations have given rise to unique perspectives and disease correlates, creating novel pathways of investigation.

A current ""waitlist crisis"" for autism diagnostic evaluation thus demands that we consider novel use of available clinical resources. Previous work has found that expert autism clinicians can identify autism in young children with high specificity after only a brief observation; rapid identification by non-experts remains untested. In the current study, 252 children ages 12-53â€‰months presented for a comprehensive autism diagnostic evaluation. We found that junior clinicians in training to become autism specialists (nâ€‰=â€‰29) accurately determined whether or not a young child would be diagnosed with autism in the first five minutes of the clinic visit in 75% of cases. Specificity of brief observations was high (0.92), suggesting that brief observations may be an effective tool for triaging young children toward autism-specific interventions. In contrast, the lower negative predictive value (0.71) of brief observations, suggest that they should not be used to rule out autism. When trainees expressed more confidence in their initial impression, their impression was more likely to match the final diagnosis. These findings add to a body of literature showing that clinical observations of suspected autism should be taken seriously, but lack of clinician concern should not be used to rule out autism or overrule other indicators of likely autism, such as parent concern or a positive screening result."

Major unresolved theoretical challenges stem from the nonspecific and probabilistic nature of the links between childhood adversity and psychopathology. The links are nonspecific because childhood adversity increases risk, through a range of mechanisms, for diverse forms of psychopathology and are probabilistic because not all individuals exposed to childhood adversity develop psychopathology.

This review centers on the accumulating evidence that psychopathology appears to be more strongly predicted by behavior and biology during states of stress. Building on this observation, our theoretical framework proposes that we can model pathways from childhood adversity to psychopathology with greater specificity and certainty by understanding stress phenotypes, defined as patterns of behavior and their corresponding biological substrates that are elicited by stressors.

We therefore investigated the phenotypic and functional differences among in vitro activated CD8(+) T cells of three different sources, namely naÃ¯ve (NTeff), memory (MTeff) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILeff) from human and mice, to better understand mechanisms behind potent effector functions and potential for overcoming current limitations. In line with the greater proliferation activity and longer telomere lengths of NTeff populations, cells of naÃ¯ve origin exhibited significantly less amounts of T cell exhaustion markers than those of MTeff and TILeff, and moreover, acquired distinct expression patterns of memory-promoting transcription factors, T-bet and Eomes, induced in a rapid and sustainable manner. NTeff cells appeared to have lower expression of Foxp1 and were refractory to apoptosis upon TGF-Î² conditioning, implying better survival potential and resistance to tumor-induced immune suppression. Of CD8(+) T cell pools activated to tumor-specific CTLs, naÃ¯ve cell generated effectors possessed the most potent cytotoxic activity, validating implications for use in rational design of adoptive immunotherapy."

"MIDBOE, Amanda M",Comparison of rapid vs in-depth qualitative analytic methods from a process evaluation of academic detailing in the Veterans Health Administration,"BACKGROUND:It is challenging to conduct and quickly disseminate findings from in-depth qualitative analyses, which can impede timely implementation of interventions because of its time-consuming methods. To better understand tradeoffs between the need for actionable results and scientific rigor, we present our method for conducting a framework-guided rapid analysis (RA) and a comparison of these findings to an in-depth analysis of interview transcripts. METHODS:Set within the context of an evaluation of a successful academic detailing (AD) program for opioid prescribing in the Veterans Health Administration, we developed interview guides informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and interviewed 10 academic detailers (clinical pharmacists) and 20 primary care providers to elicit detail about successful features of the program. For the RA, verbatim transcripts were summarized using a structured template (based on CFIR); summaries were subsequently consolidated into matrices by participant type to identify aspects of the program that worked well and ways to facilitate implementation elsewhere. For comparison purposes, we later conducted an in-depth analysis of the transcripts. We described our RA approach and qualitatively compared the RA and deductive in-depth analysis with respect to consistency of themes and resource intensity. RESULTS:Integrating the CFIR throughout the RA and in-depth analysis was helpful for providing structure and consistency across both analyses. Findings from the two analyses were consistent. The most frequently coded constructs from the in-depth analysis aligned well with themes from the RA, and the latter methods were sufficient and appropriate for addressing the primary evaluation goals. Our approach to RA was less resource-intensive than the in-depth analysis, allowing for timely dissemination of findings to our operations partner that could be integrated into ongoing implementation. CONCLUSIONS:In-depth analyses can be resource-intensive. If consistent with project needs (e.g., to quickly produce information to inform ongoing implementation or to comply with a policy mandate), it is reasonable to consider using RA, especially when faced with resource constraints. Our RA provided valid findings in a short timeframe, enabling identification of actionable suggestions for our operations partner."

"GOLDIN, philippe R",Nonlinear brain correlates of trait self-boundarylessness.,"Alterations of the sense of self induced by meditation include an increased sense of boundarylessness. In this study, we investigated behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging correlates of trait self-boundarylessness during resting state and the performance of two experimental tasks. We found that boundarylessness correlated with greater self-endorsement of words related to fluidity and with longer response times in a math task. Boundarylessness also correlated negatively with brain activity in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus during mind-wandering compared to a task targeting a minimal sense of self. Interestingly, boundarylessness showed quadratic relations to several measures. Participants reporting low or high boundarylessness, as compared to those in between, showed higher functional connectivity within the default mode network during rest, less brain activity in the medial prefrontal cortex during self-referential word processing, and less self-endorsement of words related to constancy. We relate these results to our previous findings of a quadratic relation between boundarylessness and the sense of perspectival ownership of experience. Additionally, an instruction to direct attention to the centre of experience elicited brain activation similar to that of meditation onset, including increases in anterior precentral gyrus and anterior insula and decreases in default mode network areas, for both non-meditators and experienced meditators."

"KUHN, Brooks T",Work of Breathing During Proportional Assist Ventilation as a Predictor of Extubation Failure.,"BackgroundDespite decades of research on predictors of extubation success, use of ventilatory support after extubation is common and 10-20% of patients require re-intubation. Proportional assist ventilation (PAV) mode automatically calculates estimated total work of breathing (total WOB). Here, we assessed the performance of total WOB to predict extubation failure in invasively ventilated subjects.MethodsThis prospective observational study was conducted in 6 adult ICUs at an academic medical center. We enrolled intubated subjects who successfully completed a spontaneous breathing trial, had a rapid shallow breathing index < 105 breaths/min/L, and were deemed ready for extubation by the primary team. Total WOB values were recorded at the end of a 30-min PAV trial. Extubation failure was defined as any respiratory support and/or re-intubation within 72 h of extubation. We compared total WOB scores between groups and performance of total WOB for predicting extubation failure with receiver operating characteristic curves.ResultsOf 61 subjects enrolled, 9.8% (n = 6) required re-intubation, and 50.8% (n = 31) required any respiratory support within 72 h of extubation. Median total WOB at 30 min on PAV was 0.9 J/L (interquartile range 0.7-1.3 J/L). Total WOB was significantly different between subjects who failed or were successfully extubated (median 1.1 J/L vs 0.7 J/L, P = .004). The area under the curve was 0.71 [95% CI 0.58-0.85] for predicting any requirement of respiratory support and 0.85 [95% CI 0.69-1.00] for predicting re-intubation alone within 72 h of extubation. Total WOB cutoff values maximizing sensitivity and specificity equally were 1.0 J/L for any respiratory support (positive predictive value [PPV] 70.0%, negative predictive value [NPV] 67.7%) and 1.3 J/L for re-intubation (PPV 26.3%, NPV 97.6%).ConclusionsThe discriminative performance of a PAV-derived total WOB value to predict extubation failure was good, indicating total WOB may represent an adjunctive tool for assessing extubation readiness. However, these results should be interpreted as preliminary, with specific thresholds of PAV-derived total WOB requiring further investigation in a large multi-center study."
"SOLES, Gillian L",Irreducible posterior hip dislocation in the setting of a multifocal displaced pelvic ring injury: A case report.,"Case reportTraumatic hip dislocations require prompt diagnosis and reduction to preserve the native joint. The classic irreducible posterior hip fracture-dislocation has been described as an immobile, slightly flexed, and internally rotated hip on physical exam. Classically, this irreducible pattern is associated with an ipsilateral femoral head fracture. The purpose of our report is to present an irreducible posterior hip dislocation with preserved motion in the setting of an unstable pelvic ring injury without associated femoral head pathology. Despite lacking clinical features of an irreducible hip, closed reduction in the emergency and operating rooms was unsuccessful, even after frame application for pelvis stability. Persistent irreducibility necessitated open reduction, where the femoral head was found to be buttonholed through the posterior hip capsule and blocking reduction.ConclusionA posteriorly dislocated hip with preserved motion in the setting of a concomitant unstable pelvic ring injury may belie the true locked nature of the femoroacetabular dislocation and high suspicion for femoral head incarceration is required. The description of this unique irreducible fracture pattern and the stepwise approach used for reduction may be useful for other surgeons who may encounter similar patterns of injury."

We conducted a methodologic review of test validation studies for OIE-listed diseases in wild mammals published between 2008 and 2017 and focused on study design, statistical analysis, and reporting of results. Most published papers addressed Mycobacterium bovis infection in one or more wildlife species. Our review revealed limitations or missing information about sampled animals, identification criteria for positive and negative samples (case definition), representativeness of source and target populations, and species in the study, as well as information identifying animals sampled for calculations of DSe and DSp as naturally infected captive, free-ranging, or experimentally challenged animals. The deficiencies may have reflected omissions in reporting rather than design flaws, although lack of random sampling might have induced bias in estimates of DSe and DSp. We used case studies of validation of tests for hemorrhagic diseases in deer and white-nose syndrome in hibernating bats to demonstrate approaches for validation when new pathogen serotypes or genotypes are detected and diagnostic algorithms are changed, and how purposes of tests evolve together with the evolution of the pathogen after identification. We describe potential benefits of experimental challenge studies for obtaining DSe and DSp estimates, methods to maintain sample integrity, and Bayesian latent class models for statistical analysis. We make recommendations for improvements in future studies of detection test accuracy in wild mammals."

However, excessive and uncontrolled immune reactions can lead to autoimmunity. Unraveling how the reactive versus tolerogenic state is controlled might point toward novel therapeutic strategies to treat autoimmune diseases. The surface receptor Toso/Faim3 has been linked to apoptosis, IgM binding, and innate immune responses. In this study, we used Toso-deficient mice to investigate the importance of Toso in tolerance and autoimmunity. We found that Toso(-/-) mice do not develop severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. Toso(-/-) dendritic cells were less sensitive to Toll-like receptor stimulation and induced significantly lower levels of disease-associated inflammatory T-cell responses. Consistent with this observation, the transfer of Toso(-/-) dendritic cells did not induce autoimmune diabetes, indicating their tolerogenic potential. In Toso(-/-) mice subjected to EAE induction, we found increased numbers of regulatory T cells and decreased encephalitogenic cellular infiltrates in the brain. Finally, inhibition of Toso activity in vivo at either an early or late stage of EAE induction prevented further disease progression. Taken together, our data identify Toso as a unique regulator of inflammatory autoimmune responses and an attractive target for therapeutic intervention."

"BERS, Donald M",Cardiac Protein Kinase D1 ablation alters the myocytes Î²-adrenergic response,"Î²-adrenergic (Î²-AR) signaling is essential for the adaptation of the heart to exercise and stress. Chronic stress leads to the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase D (PKD). Unlike CaMKII, the effects of PKD on excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) remain unclear. To elucidate the mechanisms of PKD-dependent ECC regulation, we used hearts from cardiac-specific PKD1 knockout (PKD1 cKO) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates. We measured calcium transients (CaT), Ca2+ sparks, contraction and L-type Ca2+ current in paced cardiomyocytes under acute Î²-AR stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO; 100&nbsp;nM). Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load was assessed by rapid caffeine (10&nbsp;mM) induced Ca2+ release. Expression and phosphorylation of ECC proteins phospholambam (PLB), troponin I (TnI), ryanodine receptor (RyR), sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) were evaluated by western blotting. At baseline, CaT amplitude and decay tau, Ca2+ spark frequency, SR Ca2+ load, L-type Ca2+ current, contractility, and expression and phosphorylation of ECC protein were all similar in PKD1 cKO vs. WT. However, PKD1 cKO cardiomyocytes presented a diminished ISO response vs. WT with less increase in CaT amplitude, slower [Ca2+]i decline, lower Ca2+ spark rate and lower RyR phosphorylation, but with similar SR Ca2+ load, L-type Ca2+ current, contraction and phosphorylation of PLB and TnI. We infer that the presence of PKD1 allows full cardiomyocyte Î²-adrenergic responsiveness by allowing optimal enhancement in SR Ca2+ uptake and RyR sensitivity, but not altering L-type Ca2+ current, TnI phosphorylation or contractile response. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which PKD1 is regulating RyR sensitivity. We conclude that the presence of basal PKD1 activity in cardiac ventricular myocytes contributes to normal Î²-adrenergic responses in Ca2+ handling."

We assessed the frequency of facial nerve sacrifice required in patients with normal preoperative facial nerve function with metastatic disease to the parotid. We evaluated the association between sacrifice and high-risk tumor variables using multivariate analysis.ResultsWe identified 53 patients with parotid metastasis and normal preoperative facial nerve function. Thirteen percent of patients required sacrifice of the main trunk of the facial nerve and 27% required sacrifice of a branch of the facial nerve. All patients who underwent facial nerve sacrifice had extracapsular spread (ECS). Perineural invasion (PNI) in the primary tumor (odds ratio [OR], 9.11; P = .041) and location of metastasis within the parotid body (OR, 6.6; P = .044) were independently associated with facial nerve sacrifice.ConclusionPatients with regionally metastatic CSCC to the parotid gland frequently require sacrifice of all or a component of the facial nerve despite normal preoperative function. The likelihood of nerve sacrifice is highest for tumors with PNI and metastatic disease within the body of the parotid."
"BEWLEY, Arnaud F",EGFR Inhibition Promotes an Aggressive Invasion Pattern Mediated by Mesenchymal-like Tumor Cells within Squamous Cell Carcinomas,"Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) with an infiltrative invasion pattern carry a higher risk of treatment failure. Such infiltrative invasion may be mediated by a mesenchymal-like subpopulation of malignant cells that we have previously shown to arise from epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and resist epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting. Here, we show that SCCs with infiltrative, high-risk invasion patterns contain abundant mesenchymal-like cells, which are rare in tumors with low-risk patterns. This cellular heterogeneity was modeled accurately in three-dimensional culture using collagen-embedded SCC spheroids, which revealed distinct invasive fronts created by collective migration of E-cadherin-positive cells versus infiltrative migration of individual mesenchymal-like cells. Because EGFR expression by mesenchymal-like cells was diminished in the spheroid model and in human SCCs, we hypothesized that SCCs shift toward infiltrative invasion mediated by this subpopulation during anti-EGFR therapy. Anti-EGFR treatment of spheroids using erlotinib or cetuximab enhanced infiltrative invasion by targeting collective migration by E-cadherin-positive cells while sparing mesenchymal-like cells; by contrast, spheroid invasion in absence of mesenchymal-like cells was abrogated by erlotinib. Similarly, cetuximab treatment of xenografts containing mesenchymal-like cells created an infiltrative invasive front composed of this subpopulation, whereas no such shift was observed upon treating xenografts lacking these cells. These results implicate mesenchymal-like SCC cells as key mediators of the infiltrative invasion seen in tumors with locally aggressive behavior. They further show that EGFR inhibition can promote an infiltrative invasion front composed of mesenchymal-like cells preferentially in tumors where they are abundant before therapy."

"CORD, Branden J",Deviation From Personalized Blood Pressure Targets Is Associated With Worse Outcome After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.,"Background and Purpose- Optimal blood pressure (BP) management during the early stages of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage remains uncertain. Observational studies have found worse outcomes in patients with increased hemodynamic variability, suggesting BP optimization as a potential neuroprotective strategy. In this study, we calculated personalized BP targets at which cerebral autoregulation was best preserved. We analyzed how deviation from these limits correlates with functional outcome. Methods- We prospectively enrolled 31 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autoregulatory function was continuously measured by interrogating changes in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived tissue oxygenation-a surrogate for cerebral blood flow-as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) in response to changes in mean arterial pressure using time-correlation analysis. The resulting autoregulatory indices were used to identify the upper and lower limit of autoregulation. Percent time that mean arterial pressure exceeded limits of autoregulation was calculated for each patient. Functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale at discharge and 90 days. Associations with outcome were analyzed using ordinal multivariate logistic regression. Results- Personalized limits of autoregulation were computed in all patients (age 57.5Â±13.4, 23F, mean World Federation of Neurological Surgeons 2Â±1, monitoring time 67.8Â±50.8 hours). Optimal BP and limits of autoregulation were calculated on average for 89.5Â±6.7% of the total monitoring period. ICP- and NIRS-derived optimal pressures strongly correlated with one another (P<0.0001). Percent time that mean arterial pressure deviated from limits of autoregulation significantly associated with worse functional outcome at discharge (NIRS, P=0.001; ICP, P=0.004) and 90 days (NIRS, P=0.002; ICP, P=0.003), adjusting separately for age, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons, vasospasm, and delayed cerebral ischemia. Conclusions- Both invasive (ICP) and noninvasive (NIRS) determination of personalized BP targets after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is feasible, and these 2 approaches revealed significant collinearity. Furthermore, exceeding individualized limits of autoregulation was associated with poor functional outcomes."

"BLOCH, Orin",Vaccine therapies in malignant glioma.,"Glioblastoma is a grade IV astrocytoma that is widely accepted in clinical neurosurgery as being an extremely lethal diagnosis. Long-term survival rates remain dismal, and even when tumors undergo gross resection with confirmation of total removal on neuroimaging, they invariably recur with even greater virulence. Standard therapeutic modalities as well as more contemporary treatments have largely resulted in disappointing improvements. However, the therapeutic potential of vaccine immunotherapy for malignant glioma should not be underestimated. In contrast to many of the available treatments, vaccine immunotherapy is unique because it offers the means of delivering treatment that is highly specific to both the patient and the tumor. Peptide, heat-shock proteins, and dendritic cell vaccines collectively encapsulate the majority of research efforts involving vaccine-based treatment modalities. In this review, important recent findings for these vaccine types are discussed in the context of ongoing clinical trials. Broad challenges to immunotherapy are also considered."

The National Institutes of Health is mandated to make certain that racially and ethnically diverse populations are included in clinical research. Despite the widespread recognition to ensure that research findings can be generalizable to all groups, there are no estimates of the prevalence or incidence of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in Vietnamese Americans, nor do we understand ADRD risk and protective factors in this group. In this article, we posit that studying Vietnamese Americans contributes to a better understanding of ADRD in general and offers unique opportunities for elucidating life course and sociocultural factors that contribute to cognitive aging disparities. That is, the unique context of Vietnamese Americans may provide understanding in terms of within-group heterogeneity and key factors in ADRD and cognitive aging. Here, we provide a brief history of Vietnamese American immigration and describe the large but often ignored heterogeneity of Asian Americans in the United States, elucidate how early life adversity and stress might influence late-life cognitive aging, and provide a basis for the role of sociocultural and health factors in the study of Vietnamese cognitive aging disparities. Research with older Vietnamese Americans provides a unique and timely opportunity to more fully delineate the factors that contribute to ADRD disparities for all populations."
"FULLER, Patrick M",Targeted disruption of supraspinal motor circuitry reveals a distributed network underlying Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)-like movements in the rat.,"In this study we uncovered, through targeted ablation, a potential role for corticospinal, cerebello-rubro-spinal, and hypothalamic A11 dopaminergic systems in the development of restless legs syndrome (RLS)-like movements during sleep. Targeted lesions in select basal ganglia (BG) structures also revealed a major role for nigrostriatal dopamine, the striatum, and the external globus pallidus (GPe) in regulating RLS-like movements, in particular pallidocortical projections from the GPe to the motor cortex. We further showed that pramipexiole, a dopamine agonist used to treat human RLS, reduced RLS-like movements. Taken together, our data show that BG-cortico-spinal, cerebello-rubro-spinal and A11 descending projections all contribute to the suppression of motor activity during sleep and sleep-wake transitions, and that disruption of these circuit nodes produces RLS-like movements. Taken together with findings from recent genomic studies in humans, our findings provide additional support for the concept that the anatomic and genetic etiological bases of RLS are diverse."

In 2012, mutations were found in the gene encoding histone variant H3.3 (H3F3A gene) in pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and pediatric hemispheric gliomas. Tumors with mutations in the H3F3A gene are generally characterized as histone mutated gliomas (HMGs) or diffuse midline gliomas. HMGs are a rare subtype of glial tumor that is malignant and fast growing, carrying a poor prognosis. In 2017, the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Program appropriated $1.7 billion toward cancer care in 10 select areas. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) was granted support to focus specifically on rare central nervous system (CNS) tumors through NCI-CONNECT. Its mission is to address the challenges and unmet needs in CNS cancer research and treatment by connecting patients, providers, researchers, and advocacy organizations to work in partnership. On September 27, 2018, NCI-CONNECT convened a workshop on histone mutated midline glioma, one of the 12 CNS cancers included in its initial portfolio. Three leaders in the field provided an overview of advances in histone mutated midline glioma research. These experts shared observations and experiences related to common scientific and clinical challenges in studying these tumors. Although the clinical focus of this workshop was on adult patients, one important objective was to start a collaborative dialogue between pediatric and adult clinicians and researchers.

"BROOKS-KAYAL, Amy R",Evidence for a non-canonical JAK/STAT signaling pathway in the synthesis of the brain's major ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors.,"BackgroundBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a major signaling molecule that the brain uses to control a vast network of intracellular cascades fundamental to properties of learning and memory, and cognition. While much is known about BDNF signaling in the healthy nervous system where it controls the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclic-AMP pathways, less is known about its role in multiple brain disorders where it contributes to the dysregulated neuroplasticity seen in epilepsy and traumatic brain injury (TBI). We previously found that neurons respond to prolonged BDNF exposure (both in vivo (in models of epilepsy and TBI) and in vitro (in BDNF treated primary neuronal cultures)) by activating the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway. This pathway is best known for its association with inflammatory cytokines in non-neuronal cells.ResultsHere, using deep RNA-sequencing of neurons exposed to BDNF in the presence and absence of well characterized JAK/STAT inhibitors, and without non-neuronal cells, we determine the BDNF transcriptome that is specifically regulated by agents that inhibit JAK/STAT signaling. Surprisingly, the BDNF-induced JAK/STAT transcriptome contains ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors coming from all the major classes expressed in the brain, along with key modulators of synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and axonal remodeling. Analysis of this dataset has revealed a unique non-canonical mechanism of JAK/STATs in neurons as differential gene expression mediated by STAT3 is not solely dependent upon phosphorylation at residue 705 and may involve a BDNF-induced interaction of STAT3 with Heterochromatin Protein 1 alpha (HP1Î±).ConclusionsThese findings suggest that the neuronal BDNF-induced JAK/STAT pathway involves more than STAT3 phosphorylation at 705, providing the first evidence for a non-canonical mechanism that may involve HP1Î±. Our analysis reveals that JAK/STAT signaling regulates many of the genes associated with epilepsy syndromes where BDNF levels are markedly elevated. Uncovering the mechanism of this novel form of BDNF signaling in the brain may provide a new direction for epilepsy therapeutics and open a window into the complex mechanisms of STAT3 transcriptional regulation in neurological disease."

"WANG, Xiao-Jing",Therapeutic Intervention Using a Smad7-Based Tat Protein to Treat Radiation-Induced Oral Mucositis.,"PURPOSE: Recent studies reported therapeutic effects of Smad7 on oral mucositis in mice without compromising radiation therapy-induced cancer cell killing in neighboring oral cancer. This study aims to assess whether a Smad7-based biologic can treat oral mucositis in a clinically relevant setting by establishing an oral mucositis model in dogs and analyzing molecular targets. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We created a truncated human Smad7 protein fused with the cell-penetrating Tat tag (Tat-PYC-Smad7). We used intensity modulated radiation therapy to induce oral mucositis in dogs and applied Tat-PYC-Smad7 to the oral mucosa in dose-finding studies after intensity modulated radiation therapy. Clinical outcomes were evaluated. Molecular targets were analyzed in biopsies and serum samples. RESULTS: Tat-PYC-Smad7 treatment significantly shortened the duration of grade 3 oral mucositis based on double-blinded Veterinary Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scores and histopathology evaluations. Topically applied Tat-PYC-Smad7 primarily penetrated epithelial cells and was undetectable in serum. NanoString nCounter Canine IO Panel identified that, compared to the vehicle samples, top molecular changes in Tat-PYC-Smad7 treated samples include reductions in inflammation and cell death and increases in cell growth and DNA repair. Consistently, immunostaining shows that Tat-PYC-Smad7 reduced DNA damage and neutrophil infiltration with attenuated TGF-Î² and NFÎºB signaling. Furthermore, IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± were lower in Tat-PYC-Smad7 treated mucosa and serum samples compared to those in vehicle controls. CONCLUSIONS: Topical Tat-PYC-Smad7 application demonstrated therapeutic effects on oral mucositis induced by intensity modulated radiation therapy in dogs. The local effects of Tat-PYC-Smad7 targeted molecules involved in oral mucositis pathogenesis as well as reduced systemic inflammatory cytokines."
"WANG, Xiao-Jing",Smad7 Ameliorates TGF-Î²-Mediated Skin Inflammation and Associated Wound Healing Defects but Not Susceptibility to Experimental Skin Carcinogenesis.,"We assessed the roles of Smad7 in skin inflammation and wound healing using genetic and pharmacological approaches. In K5.TGFÎ²1/K5.Smad7 bigenic (double transgenic) mice, Smad7 transgene expression reversed transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²1 transgene-induced inflammation, fibrosis, and subsequent epidermal hyperplasia and molecularly abolished TGF-Î² and NF-ÎºB activation. Next, we produced recombinant human Smad7 protein with a Tat-tag (Tat-Smad7) that rapidly enters cells. Subcutaneous injection of Tat-Smad7 attenuated infiltration of F4/80+ and CD11b+ leukocytes and Î±-smooth muscle actin+ fibroblasts before attenuating epidermal hyperplasia in K5.TGFÎ²1 skin. Furthermore, topically applied Tat-Smad7 on K5.TGFÎ²1 skin wounds accelerated wound closure, with improved re-epithelialization and reductions in inflammation and fibrotic response. A short treatment with Tat-Smad7 was also sufficient to reduce TGF-Î² and NF-ÎºB signaling in K5.TGFÎ²1 skin and wounds. Relevant to the clinic, we found that human diabetic wounds had elevated TGF-Î² and NF-ÎºB signaling compared with normal skin. To assess the oncogenic risk of a potential Smad7-based therapy, we exposed K5.Smad7 skin to chemical carcinogenesis and found reduced myeloid leukocyte infiltration in tumors but not accelerated carcinogenesis compared with wild-type littermates. Our study suggests the feasibility of using exogenous Smad7 below an oncogenic level to alleviate skin inflammation and wound healing defects associated with excessive activation of TGF-Î² and NF-ÎºB."

Treatment of localized DDCS is primarily surgical, though most patients present with unresectable or metastatic disease. Systemic treatment options for advanced DDCS are limited, and the benefits of chemotherapy in this patient population remain controversial. Among other systemic therapy options, there is emerging clinical evidence to support the use of immunotherapy in patients with advanced DDCS. However, studies regarding the efficacy of immunotherapy in advanced DDCS are limited. Here, we present the case of a patient with metastatic, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive DDCS treated with pembrolizumab who showed a sustained complete response for 24 months after initiation of therapy. To our knowledge, this case represents one of few documented cases of metastatic chondrosarcoma with sustained response to immunotherapy. The impressive response seen with PD-L1 inhibition in our patient indicates that immunotherapy is a successful treatment option in a subset of DDCS patients, and further investigation is needed to identify potential responders to immunotherapy."

"KIM, Jaehwan",Single-cell transcriptomics suggest distinct upstream drivers of IL-17A/F in hidradenitis versus psoriasis.,"BACKGROUND: On the basis of the mounting evidence that type 17 T (T17) cells and increased IL-17 play a key role in driving hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) lesion development, biologic agents used previously in psoriasis that block signaling of IL-17A and/or IL-17F isoforms have been repurposed to treat HS. OBJECTIVE: Our research aimed to characterize the transcriptome of HS T17 cells compared to the transcriptome of psoriasis T17 cells, along with their ligand-receptor interactions with neighborhood immune cell subsets. METHODS: Single-cell data of 12,300 cutaneous immune cells from 8 deroofing surgical HS skin samples including dermal tunnels were compared to single-cell data of psoriasis skin (19,525 cells from 11 samples) and control skin (11,920 cells from 10 samples). All single-cell data were generated by the same protocol. RESULTS: HS T17 cells expressed lower levels of IL23R and higher levels of IL1R1 and IL17F compared to psoriasis T17 cells (P&nbsp;< .05). HS Treg cells expressed higher levels of IL1R1 and IL17F compared to psoriasis Treg cells (P&nbsp;< .05). Semimature dendritic cells were the major immune cell subsets expressing IL1B in HS, and IL-1Î² ligand-receptor interactions between semimature dendritic cells and T17 cells were increased in HS compared to psoriasis (P&nbsp;< .05). HS dermal tunnel keratinocytes expressed inflammatory cytokines (IL17C, IL1A, IL1B, and IL6) that differed from the HS epidermis keratinocytes (IL36G) (P&nbsp;< .05). IL6, which synergizes with IL1B to maintain cytokine expression in T17 cells, was mainly expressed by fibroblasts in HS, which also expressed IL11+ inflammatory fibroblast genes (IL11, IL24, IL6, and POSTN) involved in the paracrine IL-1/IL-6 loop. CONCLUSION: The IL-1Î²-T17 cell cytokine axis is likely a dominant pathway in HS with HS T17 cells activated by IL-1Î² signaling, unlike psoriasis T17 cells, which are activated by IL-23 signaling."
"VAN DE WATER, Judith A",Calorie restriction and pravastatin administration during pregnancy in obese rhesus macaques modulates maternal and infant metabolism and infant brain and behavioral development,"BackgroundMaternal obesity has been associated with a higher risk of pregnancy-related complications in mothers and offspring; however, effective interventions have not yet been developed. We tested two interventions, calorie restriction and pravastatin administration, during pregnancy in a rhesus macaque model with the hypothesis that these interventions would normalize metabolic dysregulation in pregnant mothers leading to an improvement in infant metabolic and cognitive/social development.MethodsA total of 19 obese mothers were assigned to either one of the two intervention groups (nâ€‰=â€‰5 for calorie restriction; nâ€‰=â€‰7 for pravastatin) or an obese control group (nâ€‰=â€‰7) with no intervention, and maternal gestational samples and postnatal infant samples were compared with lean control mothers (nâ€‰=â€‰6) using metabolomics methods.ResultsGestational calorie restriction normalized one-carbon metabolism dysregulation in obese mothers, but altered energy metabolism in her offspring. Although administration of pravastatin during pregnancy tended to normalize blood cholesterol in the mothers, it potentially impacted the gut microbiome and kidney function of their offspring. In the offspring, both calorie restriction and pravastatin administration during pregnancy tended to normalize the activity of AMPK in the brain at 6 months, and while results of the Visual Paired-Comparison test, which measures infant recognition memory, was not significantly impacted by either of the interventions, gestational pravastatin administration, but not calorie restriction, tended to normalize anxiety assessed by the Human Intruder test.ConclusionsAlthough the two interventions tested in a non-human primate model led to some improvements in metabolism and/or infant brain development, negative impacts were also found in both mothers and infants. Our study emphasizes the importance of assessing gestational interventions for maternal obesity on both maternal and offspring long-term outcomes."
"BEGUN, David J",Identifying candidate de novo genes expressed in the somatic female reproductive tract of Drosophila melanogaster,"Most eukaryotic genes have been vertically transmitted to the present from distant ancestors. However, variable gene number across species indicates that gene gain and loss also occurs. While new genes typically originate as products of duplications and rearrangements of preexisting genes, putative de novo genes-genes born out of ancestrally nongenic sequence-have been identified. Previous studies of de novo genes in Drosophila have provided evidence that expression in male reproductive tissues is common. However, no studies have focused on female reproductive tissues. Here we begin addressing this gap in the literature by analyzing the transcriptomes of 3 female reproductive tract organs (spermatheca, seminal receptacle, and parovaria) in 3 species-our focal species, Drosophila melanogaster-and 2 closely related species, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila yakuba, with the goal of identifying putative D. melanogaster-specific de novo genes expressed in these tissues. We discovered several candidate genes, located in sequence annotated as intergenic. Consistent with the literature, these genes tend to be short, single exon, and lowly expressed. We also find evidence that some of these genes are expressed in other D. melanogaster tissues and both sexes. The relatively small number of intergenic candidate genes discovered here is similar to that observed in the accessory gland, but substantially fewer than that observed in the testis."

The increase and optimization of the detection speed of the OI-RD microscope will enable it to be a potential ultra-high throughput screening tool. This work presents a series of optimization methods that can significantly reduce the time to scan an OI-RD image. The wait time for the lock-in amplifier was decreased by the proper selection of the time constant and development of a new electronic amplifier. In addition, the time for the software to acquire data and for translation stage movement was also minimized. As a result, the detection speed of the OI-RD microscope is 10 times faster than before, making the OI-RD microscope suitable for ultra-high throughput screening applications."

The analogous benzylic acetals or ethers avoid the C-H insertion pathway completely and, after hydride transfer, undergo a de-aromatizing elimination reaction to o-QDM at ambient temperature. The resulting dienes undergo a variety of cycloaddition reactions with high diastereo- and regio-selectivity. This is one of the few examples of catalytic generation of o-QDM without the intermediacy of a benzocyclobutene and represents one of the mildest, ambient temperature processes to access these useful intermediates. This proposed mechanism is supported by DFT calculations. Moreover, the methodology was applied to the synthesis of (Â±)-isolariciresinol in 41% overall yield."
"ZACCARIA, Daniele",Long-term reduced tillage and winter cover crops can improve soil quality without depleting moisture,"California farmers who use reduced-disturbance tillage and winter cover cropping can boost production and improve soil health. However, some farmers are hesitant to try these conservation practices due to uncertainty about whether planting winter cover crops will deplete soil moisture in already drought-stricken regions. Our study addresses these concerns by looking at how long-term reduced-disturbance tillage and winter cover cropping, compared to fallowed soils with standard tillage, affected soil moisture. Although we found a statistical difference in total soil water content, the difference was only about 0.3 inches of water per foot of soil. On average, the soil water content of the top 0â€“96 inches was highest for the reduced-disturbance fields with winter cover crops. This was especially evident during our driest field season, from November 1, 2017, to March 15, 2018, when cumulative rainfall was only 1.9 inches. Our findings show that winter cover cropping and reduced-disturbance tillage can improve soil without depleting soil water levels in row crops. "
"THOMASY, Sara M",Type II Diabetes Mellitus Causes Extracellular Matrix Alterations in the Posterior Cornea That Increase Graft Thickness and Rigidity.,"PurposeThere is a pressing need to investigate the impact of type II diabetes mellitus on the posterior cornea in donor tissues given its increasing prevalence and potential impact on endothelial keratoplasty surgical outcomes.MethodsImmortalized human cultured corneal endothelial cells (CECs; HCEC-B4G12) were grown in hyperglycemic media for 2 weeks. Extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesive glycoprotein expression and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in cultured cells and corneoscleral donor tissues, as well as the elastic modulus for the Descemet membrane (DMs) and CECs of diabetic and nondiabetic donor corneas, were measured.ResultsIn CEC cultures, increasing hyperglycemia resulted in increased transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI) protein expression and colocalization with AGEs in the ECM. In donor corneas, the thicknesses of the DM and the interfacial matrix (IFM) between the DM and stroma both increased from 8.42 Â± 1.35 Âµm and 0.504 Â± 0.13 Âµm in normal corneas, respectively, to 11.13 Â± 2.91 Âµm (DM) and 0.681 Â± 0.24 Âµm (IFM) in non-advanced diabetes (P = 0.013 and P = 0.075, respectively) and 11.31 Â± 1.76 Âµm (DM) and 0.744 Â± 0.18 Âµm (IFM) in advanced diabetes (AD; P = 0.0002 and P = 0.003, respectively). Immunofluorescence in AD tissues versus controls showed increased AGEs (P < 0.001) and markedly increased labeling intensity for adhesive glycoproteins, including TGFBI, that colocalized with AGEs. The elastic modulus significantly increased between AD and control tissues for the DMs (P < 0.0001) and CECs (P < 0.0001).ConclusionsDiabetes and hyperglycemia alter human CEC ECM structure and composition, likely contributing to previously documented complications of endothelial keratoplasty using diabetic donor tissue, including tearing during graft preparation and reduced graft survival. AGE accumulation in the DM and IFM may be a useful biomarker for determining diabetic impact on posterior corneal tissue."

The purpose of this study was to use a large database of national in-patient sample to find out the use of palliative care in acute heart failure admissions. Data from 2002 to 2017 was used for analysis. Simple linear regression was used for trend analysis over the years. Variables that were statistically significant in univariate analysis were used in single-step (entry method) multiple logistic analysis. The use of palliative care was found to be low at 4.1%, although recent trends have shown an increase (from 0.4% in 2002 to 6.2% in 2017). Women (0.3% in 2002 to 6.5% in 2017) and Caucasians (0.6% in 2002 to 6.9% in 2017) had a higher proportion of PC encounters as compared to men (0.5% in 2002 to 5.9% in 2017) and other racial minorities, increasing age (OR, 1.04[CI; 1.03-1.04], p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.01), female gender (OR, 1.03[CI; 1.02-1.03], p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.01), do not resuscitate status (OR, 10.62[CI; 10.53-10.70], p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.01), diabetes mellitus (OR, 1.10[CI; 1.01-1.11], p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.01), liver disease (OR, 1.63[CI; 1.60-1.66], p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.01), renal failure (OR, 1.40[CI; 1.39-1.41], p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.01), acute myocardial infarction (OR, 1.28[CI; 1.27-1.30], p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.01), and cardiogenic shock (OR, 2.89[CI; 2.84-2.93], p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.01) were associated with higher odds of having PC encounter. In conclusion, the use of palliative care has increased in the United States over the years, however, it is still low as compared to other high-income countries."

However, current approved clinical implantable vascular devices generally have high failure rates primarily due to their surface lacking inherent functional endothelium. Here, inspired by the pathological mechanisms of vascular device failure and physiological functions of native endothelium, we developed a new generation of bioactive parylene (poly(p-xylylene))-based conformal coating to address these challenges of the vascular devices. This coating used a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to introduce an endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) specific binding ligand LXW7 (cGRGDdvc) onto the vascular devices for preventing platelet adhesion and selectively capturing endogenous EPCs. Also, we confirmed the long-term stability and function of this coating in human serum. Using two vascular disease-related large animal models, a porcine carotid artery interposition model and a porcine carotid artery-jugular vein arteriovenous graft model, we demonstrated that this coating enabled rapid generation of self-renewable ""living"" endothelium on the blood contacting surface of the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts after implantation. We expect this easy-to-apply conformal coating will present a promising avenue to engineer surface properties of ""off-the-shelf"" implantable vascular devices for long-lasting performance in the clinical settings."

Felids, the definitive hosts, drive T. gondii infections by shedding the environmentally resistant stage of the parasite (oocysts) in their feces. Few studies characterize the role of climate and anthropogenic factors in oocyst shedding among free-ranging felids, which are responsible for the majority of environmental contamination. We determined how climate and anthropogenic factors influence oocyst shedding in free-ranging domestic cats and wild felids using generalized linear mixed models. T. gondii oocyst shedding data from 47 studies were systematically reviewed and compiled for domestic cats and six wild felid species, encompassing 256 positives out of 9,635 total fecal samples. Shedding prevalence in domestic cats and wild felids was positively associated with human population density at the sampling location. Larger mean diurnal temperature range was associated with more shedding among domestic cats and warmer temperature in the driest quarter was associated with lower oocyst shedding in wild felids. Increasing human population density and temperature fluctuation can exacerbate environmental contamination with the protozoan parasite T. gondii. Management of free-ranging domestic cats could lower the burden of environmental oocysts due to their large population sizes and affinity with human settlements."

Recent advances in this technique have greatly accelerated the data acquisition speed and improved the temporal resolution of super-resolution imaging. However, it has not been quantified whether this speed increase comes at the cost of compromised image quality. The spatial and temporal resolution depends on many factors, among which laser intensity and camera speed are the two most critical parameters. Here we quantitatively compare the image quality achieved when imaging Alexa Fluor 647-immunolabeled microtubules over an extended range of laser intensities and camera speeds using three criteria - localization precision, density of localized molecules, and resolution of reconstructed images based on Fourier Ring Correlation. We found that, with optimized parameters, single-molecule switching nanoscopy at high speeds can achieve the same image quality as imaging at conventional speeds in a 5-25 times shorter time period. Furthermore, we measured the photoswitching kinetics of Alexa Fluor 647 from single-molecule experiments, and, based on this kinetic data, we developed algorithms to simulate single-molecule switching nanoscopy images. We used this software tool to demonstrate how laser intensity and camera speed affect the density of active fluorophores and influence the achievable resolution. Our study provides guidelines for choosing appropriate laser intensities for imaging Alexa Fluor 647 at different speeds and a quantification protocol for future evaluations of other probes and imaging parameters."

In this research we proposed a methodology to physically characterize the soil water medium using quantitative parameters. We incorporated the continuously measured soil water potential curve and the soil shrinkage curve to extract the physically based pedostructural (PS) parameters needed for characterizing the soil water medium. We present a methodology to generate and define functional soil mapping units that possess physical and quantitative parameters. We followed a four step general system hierarchical approach overlaying study area map, landform map, and SSURGO map. The fourth step was to validate the generated functional soil units using discriminate analysis performed on the PS parameters extracted for every soil mapping unit. Results of this study show that surface horizon (Ap) have higher PS parameter values than subsurface horizon Bt. The PS concept showed high capabilities in defining the soil mapping units, as concluded from the discriminate analysis that was performed."

tightness of the RAR for rotationally-supported galaxies have characteristics
in line with MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and can also arise within the
Cosmological Constant + Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. We use zoom
simulations of 20 galaxies with stellar masses of $M_{\star} \, \simeq
10^{7-11} \, M_{\odot}$ to study the RAR in the \texttt{FIRE-2} simulations. We
highlight the existence of simulated galaxies with non-monotonic RAR tracks
that ``hook'' down from the average relation. These hooks are challenging to
explain in Modified Inertia theories of MOND, but naturally arise in all of our
\lcdm-simulated galaxies that are dark-matter dominated at small radii and have
feedback-induced cores in their dark matter haloes. We show, analytically and
numerically, that downward hooks are expected in such cored haloes because they
have non-monotonic acceleration profiles. We also extend the relation to
accelerations below those traced by disc galaxy rotation curves. In this
regime, our simulations exhibit ``bends'' off of the MOND-inspired
extrapolation of the RAR, which, at large radii, approach $a_{\rm tot} \,
\approx \, a_{\rm bar} \, /f_{\rm b}$, where $f_{\rm b}$ is the cosmic baryon
fraction. Future efforts to search for these hooks and bends in real galaxies
will provide interesting tests for MOND and $\Lambda$CDM."

to model pack SoH and SoH CtCV of nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) and lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP)

CtCV 72.5% and 65% of the time for NCA and LFP packs, respectively. This study further investigates the
relationships between pack SoH, SoH CtCV, and the voltage response of NCA and LFP packs. The slope of
the discharge voltage response of the NCA packs was shown to have a strong correlation with pack

"GRANDI, Eleonora",Integrative human atrial modelling unravels interactive protein kinase A and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II signalling as key determinants of atrial arrhythmogenesis,"AimsAtrial fibrillation (AF), the most prevalent clinical arrhythmia, is associated with atrial remodelling manifesting as acute and chronic alterations in expression, function, and regulation of atrial electrophysiological and Ca2+-handling processes. These AF-induced modifications crosstalk and propagate across spatial scales creating a complex pathophysiological network, which renders AF resistant to existing pharmacotherapies that predominantly target transmembrane ion channels. Developing innovative therapeutic strategies requires a systems approach to disentangle quantitatively the pro-arrhythmic contributions of individual AF-induced alterations.Methods and resultsHere, we built a novel computational framework for simulating electrophysiology and Ca2+-handling in human atrial cardiomyocytes and tissues, and their regulation by key upstream signalling pathways [i.e. protein kinase A (PKA), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)] involved in AF-pathogenesis. Populations of atrial cardiomyocyte models were constructed to determine the influence of subcellular ionic processes, signalling components, and regulatory networks on atrial arrhythmogenesis. Our results reveal a novel synergistic crosstalk between PKA and CaMKII that promotes atrial cardiomyocyte electrical instability and arrhythmogenic triggered activity. Simulations of heterogeneous tissue demonstrate that this cellular triggered activity is further amplified by CaMKII- and PKA-dependent alterations of tissue properties, further exacerbating atrial arrhythmogenesis.ConclusionsOur analysis reveals potential mechanisms by which the stress-associated adaptive changes turn into maladaptive pro-arrhythmic triggers at the cellular and tissue levels and identifies potential anti-AF targets. Collectively, our integrative approach is powerful and instrumental to assemble and reconcile existing knowledge into a systems network for identifying novel anti-AF targets and innovative approaches moving beyond the traditional ion channel-based strategy."

However, the usage of VHHs is limited by the low yield of its production and purification. In order to determine the optimal purification strategy for VHH to improve the yield, a method to monitor purification at the intermediate steps is needed. In this study, a simple, sensitive, low-cost sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to quantitate VHHs throughout the purification steps. Under optimized conditions, the assay has a sensitivity of 0.149 ODÂ·mL/ng and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.029&nbsp;ng/mL. The average recoveries of the assay against the spiked samples were 101.9-106.0% and 100.7-108.0%. The method was applied to a variety of real samples for the detection of different VHHs in bacterial cell media. High amount of VHHs (up to 41.3&nbsp;mg/mL), which are comparable to the average yield of VHH in standard production protocols, were detected in the media. This study raises attention to the problem of protein losses in cell culture supernatants and provides a method for the continuous detection of the protein abundance to optimize the expression and purification protocols especially for nanobodies."

The most recent experiment (CASP13 held in 2018) saw dramatic progress in structure modeling without use of structural templates (historically ""ab initio"" modeling). Progress was driven by the successful application of deep learning techniques to predict inter-residue distances. In turn, these results drove dramatic improvements in three-dimensional structure accuracy: With the proviso that there are an adequate number of sequences known for the protein family, the new methods essentially solve the long-standing problem of predicting the fold topology of monomeric proteins. Further, the number of sequences required in the alignment has fallen substantially. There is also substantial improvement in the accuracy of template-based models. Other areas-model refinement, accuracy estimation, and the structure of protein assemblies-have again yielded interesting results. CASP13 placed increased emphasis on the use of sparse data together with modeling and chemical crosslinking, SAXS, and NMR all yielded more mature results. This paper summarizes the key outcomes of CASP13. The special issue of PROTEINS contains papers describing the CASP13 assessments in each modeling category and contributions from the participants."

This monitoring is often the first step in early detection of pregnancy abnormalities, providing an opportunity for prompt, effective intervention to prevent maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Contemporary pregnancy monitoring systems require numerous devices wired to large base units; at least five separate devices with distinct user interfaces are commonly used to detect uterine contractility, maternal blood oxygenation, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and fetal heart rate. Current monitoring technologies are expensive and complex with implementation challenges in low-resource settings where maternal morbidity and mortality is the greatest. We present an integrated monitoring platform leveraging advanced flexible electronics, wireless connectivity, and compatibility with a wide range of low-cost mobile devices. Three flexible, soft, and low-profile sensors offer comprehensive vital signs monitoring for both women and fetuses with time-synchronized operation, including advanced parameters such as continuous cuffless blood pressure, electrohysterography-derived uterine monitoring, and automated body position classification. Successful field trials of pregnant women between 25 and 41 wk of gestation in both high-resource settings (n = 91) and low-resource settings (n = 485) demonstrate the systems performance, usability, and safety."

Studies of parenting infrequently examine both positive and negative discipline techniques despite use of inductive and physical discipline being inversely related to each other and to child externalizing problems. A burgeoning literature on the biopsychosocial determinants of parenting is identifying cognitive and physiological mechanisms underlying the initiation and regulation of positive and negative parenting techniques. This cross-sectional study of parents of preschool-aged children (N = 70; 89% mothers, 43% racial-ethnic minorities) advances the parenting literature by examining predictors of parents' inductive and physical discipline use across their cognitive functioning, cardiovascular psychophysiology, children's externalizing behavior, and their interactions with one another. No main effects or interactions predicted inductive discipline, but the interaction between parents' inhibitory control and nonverbal intelligence predicted physical discipline, such that parents who scored low in both domains endorsed the most use of physical discipline in response to child misbehavior. Another interaction between parents' sympathetic activity and child externalizing behavior also predicted physical discipline. These findings are discussed in relation to parenting interventions.

Animal model systems of maternal immune activation (MIA) suggest that the maternal immune response plays a significant role in the offspring's neurodevelopment and behavioral outcomes. Extracellular free water is a measure of freely diffusing water in the brain that may be associated with neuroinflammation and impacted by MIA. The present study evaluates the brain diffusion characteristics of male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) born to MIA-exposed dams (nâ€‰=â€‰14) treated with a modified form of the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid at the end of the first trimester. Control dams received saline injections at the end of the first trimester (nâ€‰=â€‰10) or were untreated (nâ€‰=â€‰4). Offspring underwent diffusion MRI scans at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 45 months. Offspring born to MIA-exposed dams showed significantly increased extracellular free water in cingulate cortex gray matter starting as early as 6 months of age and persisting through 45 months. In addition, offspring gray matter free water in this region was significantly correlated with the magnitude of the maternal IL-6 response in the MIA-exposed dams. Significant correlations between brain volume and extracellular free water in the MIA-exposed offspring also indicate converging, multimodal evidence of the impact of MIA on brain development. These findings provide strong evidence for the construct validity of the nonhuman primate MIA model as a system of relevance for investigating the pathophysiology of human neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. Elevated free water in individuals exposed to immune activation in utero could represent an early marker of a perturbed or vulnerable neurodevelopmental trajectory."

Gut dysbiosis has been linked to several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, the relationship between gut dysbiosis and markers of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), a major contributor to ADRD, is unknown. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the connection between the gut microbiome, cognitive, and neuroimaging markers of cSVD in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Markers of cSVD included white matter hyperintensities (WMH), peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), and executive function (EF), estimated as the difference between the trail-making tests B and A. We included 972 FHS participants with MRI scans, neurocognitive measures, and stool samples and quantified the gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA sequencing. We used multivariable association and differential abundance analyses adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and education level to estimate the association between gut microbiota and WMH, PSMD, and EF measures. Our results suggest an increased abundance of Pseudobutyrivibrio and Ruminococcus genera was associated with lower WMH and PSMD (p valuesâ€‰<â€‰0.001), as well as better executive function (p valuesâ€‰<â€‰0.01). In addition, in both differential and multivariable analyses, we found that the gram-negative bacterium Barnesiella intestinihominis was strongly associated with markers indicating a higher cSVD burden. Finally, functional analyses using PICRUSt implicated various KEGG pathways, including microbial quorum sensing, AMP/GMP-activated protein kinase, phenylpyruvate, and Î²-hydroxybutyrate production previously associated with cognitive performance and dementia. Our study provides important insights into the association between the gut microbiome and cSVD, but further studies are needed to replicate the findings."

Interleukin-2 (IL-2), which modulates the survival and functionality of lymphocytes, is an attractive target for new immunotherapies but one that is limited by presence of regulatory T&nbsp;cells (Tregs) expressing the high-affinity IL-2RÎ±. The bispecific immunocytokine PD1-IL2v preferentially delivers IL-2 signaling through IL-2RÎ²Î³ on PD-1-expressing cells. Selectively targeting the intermediate-affinity IL-2RÎ²Î³ can be leveraged to induce anti-tumor immune responses in effector T&nbsp;cells and natural killer (NK) cells while limiting the negative regulation of IL-2RÎ± activation on Tregs. Using radiation therapy (RT) in combination with PD1-IL2v improves local tumor control and survival, and controls metastatic spread in orthotopic HNSCC tumor models.

Pharmacologic therapies aimed at modulating the inflammatory response to fractures have the potential to interfere with the synthesis of molecules needed for the production of bone. Infection can interfere with, and even prevent normal fracture healing from occurring. Cellular and genetic treatment strategies are actively being developed to target deficiencies, and bridge gaps that can influence how fractures heal.

While there is consensus in all vitamin D guidelines that serum levels of 25(OH)D less than 10 ng/mL should be corrected, approximately 30% of the world population's 25(OH)D levels range from 10 to 20 ng/mL, and it remains unclear whether such suboptimal levels can maintain optimal health, including sarcopenia risk.ObjectiveTo investigate the association of serum 25(OH)D level, especially suboptimal levels, with sarcopenia risk.Design, setting, and participantsThis genome-wide genetic association study was performed from August 2022 to February 2023 among the 295â€¯489 unrelated European participants from the UK Biobank (2006-2010). Nonlinear and standard mendelian randomization analyses were used to examine the association of serum 25(OH)D concentration with sarcopenia risk.ExposuresA weighted genetic risk score using 35 unrelated single-nucleotide variants from the UK Biobank and weights from the SUNLIGHT Consortium was selected as an instrumental variable for serum 25(OH)D concentration.Main outcomes and measuresThe primary outcome was sarcopenia, and the secondary outcomes consisted of grip strength, appendicular lean mass index, and gait speed.ResultsThe final genetic analyses included 295â€¯489 participants (mean [SD] age, 56.3 [8.1] years; 139â€¯216 female [52.9%]). There was an L-shaped association between genetically predicted serum 25(OH)D concentration and sarcopenia risk. The risk of sarcopenia decreased rapidly as 25(OH)D concentration increased until 20 ng/mL and then leveled off. The odds ratio of sarcopenia for serum 25(OH)D level of 10 vs 20 ng/mL was 1.74 (95% CI, 1.17-2.59). Similar patterns were also observed when the association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and risks of each of the sarcopenia indices were evaluated.Conclusions and relevanceIn this mendelian randomization genetic association study of adults in the UK Biobank, the findings supported a nonlinear association between suboptimal 25(OH)D levels and sarcopenia risk. Randomized clinical trials among participants with suboptimal 25(OH)D levels are required to verify the potential causality."

"SEKER, Erkin",Simulated surface diffusion in nanoporous gold and its dependence on surface curvature,"The morphological evolution of nanoporous gold is generally believed to be governed by surface diffusion. This work specifically explores the dependence of mass transport by surface diffusion on the curvature of a gold surface. The surface diffusivity is estimated by molecular dynamics simulations for a variety of surfaces of constant mean curvature, eliminating any chemical potential gradients and allowing the possible dependence of the surface diffusivity on mean curvature to be isolated. The apparent surface diffusivity is found to have an activation energy of âˆ¼0.74 eV with a weak dependence on curvature, but is consistent with the values reported in the literature. The apparent concentration of mobile surface atoms is found to be highly variable, having an Arrhenius dependence on temperature with an activation energy that also has a weak curvature dependence. These activation energies depend on curvature in such a way that the rate of mass transport by surface diffusion is nearly independent of curvature, but with a higher activation energy of âˆ¼1.01 eV. The curvature dependencies of the apparent surface diffusivity and concentration of mobile surface atoms is believed to be related to the expected lifetime of a mobile surface atom, and has the practical consequence that a simulation study that does not account for this finite lifetime could underestimate the activation energy for mass transport via surface diffusion by âˆ¼0.27 eV."

Here we use 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine fecal microbiome changes in 46 domestic cats with chronic digestive issues that received FMTs using lyophilized stool that was delivered in oral capsules. Fecal samples were collected from FMT recipients before and two weeks after the end of the full course of 50 capsules, as well as from their stool donors (N = 10), and other healthy cats (N = 113). The fecal microbiomes of FMT recipients varied with host clinical signs and dry kibble consumption, and shifts in the relative abundances of Clostridium, Collinsella, Megamonas, Desulfovibrio and Escherichia were observed after FMT. Overall, donors shared 13% of their bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with FMT recipients and the most commonly shared ASVs were classified as Prevotella 9, Peptoclostridium, Bacteroides, and Collinsella. Lastly, the fecal microbiomes of cats with diarrhea became more similar to the microbiomes of age-matched and diet-matched healthy cats compared to cats with constipation. Overall, our results suggest that microbiome responses to FMT may be modulated by the FMT recipients initial presenting clinical signs, diet, and their donors microbiome."

While the role of Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) on antigen-specific T cell responses is extensively characterized, its role in bystander T cell responses is less clear. We examined the role of the PD-1 pathway during human and mouse non-antigen-specific memory T cell bystander activation and observed that PD-1+ T cells demonstrated less activation and proliferation than activated PD-1- populations in vitro. Higher activation and proliferative responses were also observed in the PD-1- memory population in both mice and patients with cancer receiving high-dose IL-2, mirroring the in vitro phenotypes. This inhibitory effect of PD-1 could be reversed by PD-1 blockade in vivo or observed using memory T cells from PD-1-/- mice. Interestingly, increased activation through abrogation of PD-1 signaling in bystander-activated T cells also resulted in increased apoptosis due to activation-induced cell death (AICD) and eventual T cell loss in vivo. These results demonstrate that the PD-1/PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway inhibited bystander-activated memory T cell responses but also protected cells from AICD."
"ZWINGENBERGER, Allison L","The diagnostic yield of preoperative screening for oral cancer in dogs over 15 years, part 2: distant screening.","ObjectiveDetermine diagnostic yield of chest, abdomen, and 4-site screening to diagnose metastatic disease and secondary diseases of prognostic significance in dogs with oral cancer.SampleMedical records from 381 dogs with histologically confirmed oral tumors that underwent preoperative screening were retrospectively reviewed.ResultsThoracic metastasis was diagnosed in 4.9% (0.9% odontogenic, 6.5% nonodontogenic) of oral tumors. Oral malignant melanoma and multilobular osteochondrosarcoma were most at risk. Abdominal metastasis was diagnosed in 2% of oral tumors (0% odontogenic, 3.1% nonodontogenic) and cytologically confirmed in 2 cases (0.6% [2/295)] of all abdominal ultrasounds (AUS) 5.5% [2/36] of all AUS that had cytology). Both cases had oral malignant melanoma. Incidental disease was diagnosed in 53.1% and 81.3% of thoracic and abdominal screenings, respectively. Major findings were more common in AUS (7.8%) compared to thoracic screening (1.9%). The prevalence of incidental findings was similar for odontogenic and nonodontogenic tumors. Both metastasis and major findings were diagnosed more commonly with thoracic CT compared to radiographs. Metastasis or a major finding of prognostic significance was diagnosed in at least 1 test in 27.8% of patients that had head CT, lymph node cytology, thoracic screening, and AUS (n = 115).Clinical relevanceMajor incidental findings were more commonly detected with AUS and were diagnosed in 1 in every 12 patients. However, metastatic disease was most commonly detected with thoracic screening. When all 4 screening tests are performed, there is an approximately 1 in 4 chance of diagnosing metastasis or major significant disease regardless of tumor type."

"CORTEZ, Daniel L",Chest palpitations in a teenager as an unusual presentation of Lyme disease: case report.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of Lyme disease (LD) in North America has increased substantially in the past two decades. Concomitant with the increased incidence of infection has been&nbsp;an enhancement in the&nbsp;recognition of LD complications. Here, we report a case of Lyme carditis complicated by heart block in a pediatric patient admitted to our childrens hospital. What is unique about this case is that the complaint of chest palpitations is an infrequent presentation of LD, and what it adds to the scientific literature is an improved understanding of LD in the pediatric population. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 16-year-old male who presented with the main concerns of acute onset of palpitations and chest pain. An important clinical finding was Erythema migrans (EM) on physical exam. The primary diagnoses were LD with associated Lyme carditis, based on the finding of 1st degree atrioventricular heart block (AVB) and positive IgM and IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi. Interventions included echocardiography, electrocardiography (EKG), and intravenous antibiotics. The hospital course was further remarkable for transition to 2nd degree heart block and transient episodes of complete heart block. A normal sinus rhythm and PR interval were restored after antibiotic therapy and the primary outcome was that of an uneventful recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Lyme carditis occurs in <â€‰5% of LD cases, but the take-away lesson of this case is that carditis can be the presenting manifestation of B. burgdorferi infection in pediatric patients. Any patient with suspected Lyme carditis manifesting cardiac symptoms such as syncope, chest pain, or EKG changes should be admitted for parenteral antibiotic therapy and cardiac monitoring. The most common manifestation of Lyme carditis is AVB. AVB may manifest as first-degree block, or may present as&nbsp;high-grade second or third-degree&nbsp;block. Other manifestations of Lyme carditis&nbsp;may include&nbsp;myopericarditis, left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiomegaly. Resolution of carditis is typically achieved through antibiotic administration, although pacemaker placement should be considered if the PR interval fails to normalize or if higher degrees of heart block, with accompanying symptoms, are encountered. With the rising incidence of LD, providers must maintain a high level of suspicion in order to promptly diagnose and treat Lyme carditis."

Here, we evaluate choroidal thickness and vascularity in aged rhesus macaques to better understand the choroid's role in this nonhuman primate model of AMD.MethodsWe analyzed optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of 244 eyes from 122&nbsp;rhesus macaques (aged 4-32&nbsp;years) to measure choroidal thickness (CT) and choroidal vascularity index (CVI). Drusen number, size, and volume were measured by semiautomated annotation and segmentation of OCT images. We performed regression analyses to determine any association of CT or CVI with age, sex, and axial length and to determine if the presence and volume of soft drusen impacted these choroidal parameters.ResultsIn rhesus macaques, subfoveal CT decreased with age at 3.2 Âµm/y (R2 = 0.481, P < 0.001), while CVI decreased at 0.66% per year (R2 = 0.257, P < 0.001). Eyes with soft drusen exhibited thicker choroid (179.9 Â± 17.5 Âµm vs. 162.0 Â± 27.9 Âµm, P < 0.001) and higher CVI (0.612 Â± 0.051 vs. 0.577 Â± 0.093, P = 0.005) than age-matched control animals. Neither CT or CVI appeared to be associated with drusen number, size, or volume in this cohort. However, some drusen in macaques were associated with underlying choroidal vessel enlargement resembling pachydrusen in human patients with AMD.ConclusionsChanges in the choroidal vasculature in rhesus macaques resemble choroidal changes in human aging, but eyes with drusen exhibit choroidal thickening, increased vascularity, and phenotypic characteristics of pachydrusen observed in some patients with AMD."

Acute hepatitis B may be asymptomatic or cause clinical illness similar to infections caused by other hepatotropic viruses (hepatitis A to E). Most acute infections resolve without sequelae; however, progression to chronic infection may occur. The risk for developing chronic infection is inversely related to age at the time of acquisition of infection. The main morbidity and mortality from hepatitis B occur secondary to chronic hepatitis B infection, which may result in cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment of acute hepatitis B infection is primarily supportive. Children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis B infection should undergo routine monitoring for disease progression and to determine appropriate treatment initiation. Treatment includes antiviral agents and interferon and is usually managed by pediatric liver specialists. Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccination, which is universally recommended for infants in most industrialized nations as well as in many developing areas."
"MORRIS, Elizabeth A",Developing a Technology Acceptability and Usage Survey (TAUS) for mHealth Intervention Planning and Evaluation in Nigeria: Pilot Study.,"BACKGROUND: Technology acceptability and usage surveys (TAUS) are brief questionnaires that measure technology comfort, typical daily use, and access in a population. However, current measures are not adapted to low- and middle-income country (LMIC) contexts. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this pilot study was to develop a TAUS that could be used to inform the implementation of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention in Nigeria. METHODS: A literature review of validated technology comfort and usage scales was conducted to identify candidate items. The draft measure was reviewed for face validity by an expert panel comprised of clinicians and researchers with cultural, methodological, and clinical expertise. The measure was piloted by radiologists at an oncology symposium in Nigeria. RESULTS: After expert review, the final measure included 18 items organized into 3 domains: (1) comfort with using mobile applications, (2) reliability of internet or electricity, and (3) attitudes toward using computers or mobile applications in clinical practice. The pilot sample (n=16) reported high levels of comfort and acceptability toward using mHealth applications in the clinical setting but faced numerous infrastructure challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Pilot results indicate that the TAUS may be a feasible and appropriate measure for assessing technology usage and acceptability in LMIC clinical contexts. Dedicating a domain to technology infrastructure and access yielded valuable insights for program implementation."

This retrospective study included 48 female patients with 49 biopsy-proven breast cancers who underwent pretreatment breast CEM and MRI. Radiomics analysis was performed by using MaZda software. Radiomics parameters were correlated with tumor histology (invasive vs. non-invasive), hormonal status (HR+ vs. HR-), and grading (low grade G1 + G2 vs. high grade G3). CEM radiomics analysis yielded classification accuracies of up to 92% for invasive vs. non-invasive breast cancers, 95.6% for HR+ vs. HR- breast cancers, and 77.8% for G1 + G2 vs. G3 invasive cancers. MRI radiomics analysis yielded classification accuracies of up to 90% for invasive vs. non-invasive breast cancers, 82.6% for HR+ vs. HR- breast cancers, and 77.8% for G1+G2 vs. G3 cancers. Preliminary results indicate a potential of both radiomics analysis of DCE-MRI and CEM for non-invasive assessment of tumor-invasiveness, hormone receptor status, and tumor grade. CEM may serve as an alternative to MRI if MRI is not available or contraindicated."

"FRANK, Matthias","A user-friendly plug-and-play cyclic olefin copolymer-based microfluidic chip for room-temperature, fixed-target serial crystallography.","Over the past two decades, serial X-ray crystallography has enabled the structure determination of a wide range of proteins. With the advent of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), ever-smaller crystals have yielded high-resolution diffraction and structure determination. A crucial need to continue advancement is the efficient delivery of fragile and micrometre-sized crystals to the X-ray beam intersection. This paper presents an improved design of an all-polymer microfluidic `chip for room-temperature fixed-target serial crystallography that can be tailored to broadly meet the needs of users at either synchrotron or XFEL light sources. The chips are designed to be customized around different types of crystals and offer users a friendly, quick, convenient, ultra-low-cost and robust sample-delivery platform. Compared with the previous iteration of the chip [Gilbile et al. (2021), Lab Chip, 21, 4831-4845], the new design eliminates cleanroom fabrication. It has a larger imaging area to volume, while maintaining crystal hydration stability for both in situ crystallization or direct crystal slurry loading. Crystals of two model proteins, lysozyme and thaumatin, were used to validate the effectiveness of the design at both synchrotron (lysozyme and thaumatin) and XFEL (lysozyme only) facilities, yielding complete data sets with resolutions of 1.42, 1.48 and 1.70â€…Ã…, respectively. Overall, the improved chip design, ease of fabrication and high modifiability create a powerful, all-around sample-delivery tool that structural biologists can quickly adopt, especially in cases of limited sample volume and small, fragile crystals."

Given the difficulties inherent to performing mechanistic biochemical and biophysical studies of membrane proteins in vitro, we previously developed a facile HeLa cell-based cell-free expression (CFE) system that enables the efficient reconstitution of full-length (FL) functional inner nuclear membrane Sad1/UNC-84 (SUN) proteins (i.e., SUN1 and SUN2) in supported lipid bilayers. Here, we provide evidence that suggests that the reconstitution of CFE-synthesized FL membrane proteins in supported lipid bilayers occurs primarily through the fusion of endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes present within our CFE reactions with our supported lipid bilayers. In addition, we demonstrate the ease with which our synthetic biology platform can be used to investigate the impact of the chemical environment on the ability of CFE-synthesized FL SUN proteins reconstituted in supported lipid bilayers to interact with the luminal domain of the KASH protein nesprin-2. Moreover, we use our platform to study the molecular requirements for the homo- and heterotypic interactions between SUN1 and SUN2. Finally, we show that our platform can be used to simultaneously reconstitute three different CFE-synthesized FL membrane proteins in a single supported lipid bilayer. Overall, these results establish our HeLa cell-based CFE and supported lipid bilayer reconstitution platform as a powerful tool for performing mechanistic dissections of the oligomerization and function of FL membrane proteins in vitro. While our platform is not a substitute for cell-based studies, it does provide important mechanistic insights into the biology of difficult-to-study membrane proteins."

Several methods to quantify skin innervation during wound healing have been reported. Those usually require multiple observers, are complex and labor-intensive, and the noise/background associated with the immunohistochemistry (IHC) images could cause quantification errors/user bias. In this study, we employed the state-of-the-art deep neural network, Denoising Convolutional Neural Network (DnCNN), to perform pre-processing and effectively reduce the noise in the IHC images. Additionally, we utilized an automated image analysis tool, assisted by Matlab, to accurately determine the extent of skin innervation during various stages of wound healing. The 8&nbsp;mm wound is generated using a circular biopsy punch in the wild-type mouse. Skin samples were collected on days 3, 7, 10 and 15, and sections from paraffin-embedded tissues were stained against pan-neuronal marker- protein-gene-product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) antibody. On day 3 and day 7, negligible nerve fibers were present throughout the wound with few only on the lateral boundaries of the wound. On day 10, a slight increase in nerve fiber density appeared, which significantly increased on day 15. Importantly, we found a positive correlation (R2â€‰=â€‰0.926) between nerve fiber density and re-epithelization, suggesting an association between re-innervation and re-epithelization. These results established a quantitative time course of re-innervation in wound healing, and the automated image analysis method offers a novel and useful tool to facilitate the quantification of innervation in the skin and other tissues."
"TRAINOR, Brian C",Sexual differentiation of neural mechanisms of stress sensitivity during puberty,"Anxiety disorders are a major public health concern and current treatments are inadequate for many individuals. Anxiety is more common in women than men and this difference arises during puberty. Sex differences in physiological stress responses may contribute to this variability. During puberty, gonadal hormones shape brain structure and function, but the extent to which these changes affect stress sensitivity is unknown. We examined how pubertal androgens shape behavioral and neural responses to social stress in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), a model species for studying sex differences in stress responses. In adults, social defeat reduces social approach and increases social vigilance in females but not males. We show this sex difference is absent in juveniles, and that prepubertal castration sensitizes adult males to social defeat. Adult gonadectomy does not alter behavioral responses to defeat, indicating that gonadal hormones act during puberty to program behavioral responses to stress in adulthood. Calcium imaging in the medioventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) showed that social threats increased neural activity and that prepubertal castration generalized these responses to less threatening social contexts. These results support recent hypotheses that the BNST responds to immediate threats. Prepubertal treatment with the nonaromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone acts in males and females to reduce the effects of defeat on social approach and vigilance in adults. These data indicate that activation of androgen receptors during puberty is critical for programming behavioral responses to stress in adulthood."

The purpose of this report is to examine trends of gabapentinoid use among US adults with cancer from 2005 to 2015. METHODS: We conducted a serial, cross-sectional study using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). We performed multiple logistic regression to examine the annual percentages of gabapentinoid users, which were adjusted for age, sex, and US region of residence. The amount of gabapentinoid prescriptions filled in 2015 was also estimated. RESULTS: The adjusted percentage of gabapentinoid users in 2015 was 5.60% (3.79%, 7.41%), 2.39 times greater than the percentage in 2005 (p < .001). By 2015, the number of gabapentinoid prescriptions had grown to approximately 3.52 million (2.40 million, 4.65 million). CONCLUSION: We observed greater than a twofold increase in the trend of gabapentinoid medication use among US adults with cancer. Investigations on the long-term efficacy of gabapentinoids for complex pain syndromes, and mitigation of risks, is essential to guide informed clinical management and keep patients safe."

"HACKMANN, Timothy J",The oxidoreductase activity of Rnf balances redox cofactors during fermentation of glucose to propionate in Prevotella.,"Propionate is a microbial metabolite formed in the gastrointestinal tract, and it affects host physiology as a source of energy and signaling molecule. Despite the importance of propionate, the biochemical pathways responsible for its formation are not clear in all microbes. For the succinate pathway used during fermentation, a key enzyme appears to be missing-one that oxidizes ferredoxin and reduces NAD. Here we show that Rnf [ferredoxin-NAD+ oxidoreductase (Na+-transporting)] is this key enzyme in two abundant bacteria of the rumen (Prevotella brevis and Prevotella ruminicola). We found these bacteria form propionate, succinate, and acetate with the classic succinate pathway. Without ferredoxin:NAD+ oxidoreductase, redox cofactors would be unbalanced; it would produce almost equal excess amounts of reduced ferredoxin and oxidized NAD. By combining growth experiments, genomics, proteomics, and enzyme assays, we point to the possibility that these bacteria solve this problem by oxidizing ferredoxin and reducing NAD with Rnf [ferredoxin-NAD+ oxidoreductase (Na+-transporting)]. Genomic and phenotypic data suggest many bacteria may use Rnf similarly. This work shows the ferredoxin:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity of Rnf is important to propionate formation in Prevotella species and other bacteria from the environment, and it provides fundamental knowledge for manipulating fermentative propionate production."

It is a bicyclic octapeptide and represents up to 40% of the amatoxins in mushrooms, damaging the liver and kidneys. Current methods of detecting amatoxins are time-consuming and require the use of expensive equipment. A novel label-free electrochemical immunosensor was successfully developed for rapid detection of Î±-amanitin, which was fabricated by immobilization of anti-Î±-amanitin antibodies onto a functionalized cellulose nanofibrous membrane-modified carbon screen-printed electrode. An oxidation peak of the captured amanitin on the tethered antibodies was observed at 0.45 V. The performance of the nanofibrous membrane on the electrode and necessary fabrication steps were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Due to its unique structural features and properties such as high specific surface area and microporous structure, the nanofibrous membrane as an immunosensor matrix for antibody tethering improved the electrochemical performance of the immunosensor by more than 3 times compared with cast membranes. Under the optimal conditions, the assembled immunosensor exhibited high sensitivity toward Î±-amanitin detection in the range of 0.009-2 ng mL-1 with a limit of detection of 8.3 pg mL-1. The results clearly indicate that the fabricated nanofiber-based-immunosensor is suitable for point-of-care detection of lethal Î±-amanitin in human urine without any pretreatment within 30 min."

In publicly available equine genomes, AFs ranged from 0.06 to 0.1.Conclusions and clinical importanceMany PM-confirmed cases of eNAD/EDM were wild-type for the 2 intronic CD36 SNPs, suggesting either a false positive association or genetic heterogeneity of eNAD/EDM within the QH breed."
"LUXTON, Gw G",Function of Torsin AAA+ ATPases in Pseudorabies Virus Nuclear Egress,"Newly assembled herpesvirus nucleocapsids traverse the intact nuclear envelope by a vesicle-mediated nucleo-cytoplasmic transport for final virion maturation in the cytoplasm. For this, they bud at the inner nuclear membrane resulting in primary enveloped particles in the perinuclear space (PNS) followed by fusion of the primary envelope with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). While the conserved viral nuclear egress complex orchestrates the first steps, effectors of fusion of the primary virion envelope with the ONM are still mostly enigmatic but might include cellular proteins like SUN2 or ESCRT-III components. Here, we analyzed the influence of the only known AAA+ ATPases located in the endoplasmic reticulum and the PNS, the Torsins (Tor), on nuclear egress of the alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus. For this overexpression of wild type and mutant proteins as well as CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was applied. Neither single overexpression nor gene knockout (KO) of TorA or TorB had a significant impact. However, TorA/B double KO cells showed decreased viral titers at early time points of infection and an accumulation of primary virions in the PNS pointing to a delay in capsid release during nuclear egress."

HYPOTHESIS: Vaccines decrease the occurrence of clinical disease in EHV-1-infected horses. METHODS: A systematic review was performed searching multiple databases to identify relevant studies. Selection criteria were original peer-reviewed research reports that investigated the in vivo use of vaccines for the prevention of disease caused by EHV-1 in domesticated horses. Main outcomes of interest included pyrexia, abortion, neurologic disease, viremia, and nasal shedding. We evaluated risk of bias, conducted exploratory meta-analyses of incidence data for the main outcomes, and performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for each vaccine subtype. RESULTS: A total of 1018 unique studies were identified, of which 35 met the inclusion criteria. Experimental studies accounted for 31/35 studies, with the remainder being observational studies. Eight vaccine subclasses were identified including commercial (modified-live, inactivated, mixed) and experimental (modified-live, inactivated, deletion mutant, DNA, recombinant). Risk of bias was generally moderate, often because of underreporting of research methods, and sample sizes were small leading to imprecision in the estimate of the effect size. Several studies reported either no benefit or minimal vaccine efficacy for the primary outcomes of interest. Meta-analyses revealed significant heterogeneity was present, and our confidence in the quality of evidence for most outcomes was low to moderate. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Our review indicates that commercial and experimental vaccines minimally reduce the incidence of clinical disease associated with EHV-1 infection."

Six patients with poor visual acuity or visual field defects due to a stroke or a brain tumour were enrolled at a U.S. Ophthalmology Department. Participants were trained to use OrCam Read and given a loaner device for the 1â€‰month duration of the study. Various assessments, including daily function tests, the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25, and the 10-item neuro-ophthalmic supplement, were administered at the first and last visits. Patients experience with the device was evaluated with weekly telephone and end-of-study satisfaction surveys. The main outcome measures were the patient satisfaction with OrCam and the mean assessment scores between enrolment and final visits. The intervention with OrCam significantly improved patients ability to complete daily tasks and participants reported good satisfaction with the device. The results also show non-significant improvement with distant activities, dependency, and role difficulties. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of studying vision-related quality-of-life using a portable vision device in this patient population and pave the way for a larger study to validate the results of this study."
"SATO, Daisuke",The formation of KV2.1 macro-clusters is required for sex-specific differences in L-type CaV1.2 clustering and function in arterial myocytes,"In arterial myocytes, the canonical function of voltage-gated CaV1.2 and KV2.1 channels is to induce myocyte contraction and relaxation through their responses to membrane depolarization, respectively. Paradoxically, KV2.1 also plays a sex-specific role by promoting the clustering and activity of CaV1.2 channels. However, the impact of KV2.1 protein organization on CaV1.2 function remains poorly understood. We discovered that KV2.1 forms micro-clusters, which can transform into large macro-clusters when a critical clustering site (S590) in the channel is phosphorylated in arterial myocytes. Notably, female myocytes exhibit greater phosphorylation of S590, and macro-cluster formation compared to males. Contrary to current models, the activity of KV2.1 channels seems unrelated to density or macro-clustering in arterial myocytes. Disrupting the KV2.1 clustering site (KV2.1S590A) eliminated KV2.1 macro-clustering and sex-specific differences in CaV1.2 cluster size and activity. We propose that the degree of KV2.1 clustering tunes CaV1.2 channel function in a sex-specific manner in arterial myocytes."
"SADOGHI, Mohammad",Data-CASE: Grounding Data Regulations for Compliant Data Processing Systems,"Data regulations, such as GDPR, are increasingly being adopted globally to protect against unsafe data management practices. Such regulations are, often ambiguous (with multiple valid interpretations) when it comes to defining the expected dynamic behavior of data processing systems. This paper argues that it is possible to represent regulations such as GDPR formally as invariants using a (small set of) data processing concepts that capture system behavior. When such concepts are grounded, i.e., they are provided with a single unambiguous interpretation, systems can achieve compliance by demonstrating that the system-actions they implement maintain the invariants (representing the regulations). To illustrate our vision, we propose Data-CASE, a simple yet powerful model that (a) captures key data processing concepts (b) a set of invariants that describe regulations in terms of these concepts. We further illustrate the concept of grounding using ""deletion"" as an example and highlight several ways in which end-users, companies, and software designers/engineers can use Data-CASE."

Genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association studies have identified various genes and genetic variants in lipid metabolism that are associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, the molecular mechanisms of sphingomyelin and ceramide disruption remain to be determined. We focus on the sphingolipid pathway and carry out multi-omics analyses to identify central and peripheral metabolic changes in Alzheimer's patients, correlating them to imaging features. Our multi-omics approach is based on (a) 2114 human post-mortem brain transcriptomics to identify differentially expressed genes; (b) in silico metabolic flux analysis on context-specific metabolic networks identified differential reaction fluxes; (c) multimodal neuroimaging analysis on 1576 participants to associate genetic variants in sphingomyelin pathway with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis; (d) plasma metabolomic and lipidomic analysis to identify associations of lipid species with dysregulation in Alzheimer's; and (e) metabolite genome-wide association studies to define receptors within the pathway as a potential drug target. We validate our hypothesis in amyloidogenic APP/PS1 mice and show prolonged exposure to fingolimod&nbsp;alleviated synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment in mice. Our integrative multi-omics approach identifies potential targets in the sphingomyelin pathway and suggests modulators of S1P metabolism as possible candidates for Alzheimer's disease treatment."

The purpose of this study was to determine our institutional compliance with this recommendation.MethodsThis was a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with sarcoma in the extremities who received CT imaging of the chest for pulmonary staging and surveillance at our institution from 2005 to 2023. A total of 1916 CT studies were included for analysis. We scrutinized ordering patterns before and after 2015 based on the ACR-published&nbsp;metastasis staging and screening guidelines. An institutional and patient cost analysis was performed between CT modalities.ResultsThe prevalence of CT scans ordered and performed with contrast was greater than those without contrast both prior and post-ACR 2015 guidelines. Furthermore, 79.2% of patient's final surveillance CTs after 2015 were performed with contrast. A cost analysis was performed and demonstrated an additional $297â€‰704 in patient and institutional costs.ConclusionsAt our institution, upon review of CT chest imaging for pulmonary staging and surveillance in patients with extremity sarcoma the use of contrast has been routinely utilized despite a lack of evidence for its necessity and contrary to ACR guidelines."

Studies comparing patient and provider satisfaction for ATP with that for synchronous telepsychiatry (STP) do not exist. Methods: This mixed-methods study is a secondary analysis of patients' and primary care providers' (PCPs) satisfaction from a randomized clinical trial of ATP compared with STP. Patients and their PCPs completed satisfaction surveys, and provided unstructured feedback about their experiences with either ATP or STP. Differences in patient satisfaction were assessed using mixed-effects logistic regression models, and the qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis with an inductive coding framework. Results: Patient satisfaction overall was high with 84% and 97% of respondents at 6 months reported being somewhat or completely satisfied with ATP and STP, respectively. Patients in the STP group were more likely to report being completely satisfied, to recommend the program to a friend, and to report being comfortable with their care compared with ATP (all p < 0.05). However, there was no difference between the patients in ATP and STP in perceived change in clinical outcomes (pâ€‰=â€‰0.51). The PCP quantitative data were small, and thus only summarized descriptively. Conclusions: Patients expressed their overall satisfaction with both STP and ATP. Patients in ATP reported more concerns about the process, likely because feedback after ATP was slower than that after STP consultations. PCPs had no apparent preference for STP or ATP, and reported implementing the psychiatrists' recommendations for both groups when such recommendations were made, which supports our previous findings.

Adults experiencingâ€‰4 or more monthly FOSs while receiving stable treatment (1-3 ASMs) were enrolled at 97 sites in North America and Europe.InterventionsPatients were randomized 2:1:1:2 to receive XEN1101, 25, 20, or 10 mg, or placebo with food once daily for 8 weeks. Dosage titration was not used. On completion of the double-blind phase, patients were offered the option of entering an open-label extension (OLE). Patients not participating in the OLE had follow-up safety visits (1 and 6 weeks after the final dose).Main outcomes and measuresThe primary efficacy end point was the median percent change from baseline in monthly FOS frequency. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded and comprehensive laboratory assessments were made. Modified intention-to-treat analysis was conducted.ResultsA total of 325 patients who were randomized and treated were included in the safety analysis; 285 completed the 8-week double-blind phase. In the 325 patients included, mean (SD) age was 40.8 (13.3) years, 168 (51.7%) were female, and 298 (91.7%) identified their race as White. Treatment with XEN1101 was associated with seizure reduction in a robust dose-response manner. The median (IQR) percent reduction from baseline in monthly FOS frequency was 52.8% (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001 vs placebo; IQR, -80.4% to -16.9%) for 25 mg, 46.4% (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001 vs placebo; IQR, -76.7% to -14.0%) for 20 mg, and 33.2% (Pâ€‰=â€‰.04 vs placebo; IQR, â€‰-61.8% to 0.0%) for 10 mg, compared with 18.2% (IQR, -37.3% to 7.0%) for placebo. XEN1101 was generally well tolerated and TEAEs were similar to those of commonly prescribed ASMs, and no TEAEs leading to death were reported.Conclusions and relevanceThe efficacy and safety findings of this clinical trial support the further clinical development of XEN1101 for the treatment of FOSs.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03796962."
"JOINER, Wilsaan M",Review and critique of current testing protocols for upper-limb prostheses: a call for standardization amidst rapid technological advancements.,"This article provides a comprehensive narrative review of physical task-based assessments used to evaluate the multi-grasp dexterity and functional impact of varying control systems in pediatric and adult upper-limb prostheses. Our search returned 1,442 research articles from online databases, of which 25 tests-selected for their scientific rigor, evaluation metrics, and psychometric properties-met our review criteria. We observed that despite significant advancements in the mechatronics of upper-limb prostheses, these 25 assessments are the only validated evaluation methods that have emerged since the first measure in 1948. This not only underscores the lack of a consistently updated, standardized assessment protocol for new innovations, but also reveals an unsettling trend: as technology outpaces standardized evaluation measures, developers will often support their novel devices through custom, study-specific tests. These boutique assessments can potentially introduce bias and jeopardize validity. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that current validated evaluation methods often overlook the influence of competing interests on test success. Clinical settings and research laboratories differ in their time constraints, access to specialized equipment, and testing objectives, all of which significantly influence assessment selection and consistent use. Therefore, we propose a dual testing approach to address the varied demands of these distinct environments. Additionally, we found that almost all existing task-based assessments lack an integrated mechanism for collecting patient feedback, which we assert is essential for a holistic evaluation of upper-limb prostheses. Our review underscores the pressing need for a standardized evaluation protocol capable of objectively assessing the rapidly advancing prosthetic technologies across all testing domains."
"SCHMIDT, Rebecca J",Maternal educational attainment in pregnancy and epigenome-wide DNA methylation changes in the offspring from birth until adolescence.,"Maternal educational attainment (MEA) shapes offspring health through multiple potential pathways. Differential DNA methylation may provide a mechanistic understanding of these long-term associations. We aimed to quantify the associations of MEA with offspring DNA methylation levels at birth, in childhood and in adolescence. Using 37 studies from high-income countries, we performed meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to quantify the associations of completed years of MEA at the time of pregnancy with offspring DNA methylation levels at birth (nâ€‰=â€‰9 881), in childhood (nâ€‰=â€‰2 017), and adolescence (nâ€‰=â€‰2 740), adjusting for relevant covariates. MEA was found to be associated with DNA methylation at 473 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites at birth, one in childhood, and four in adolescence. We observed enrichment for findings from previous EWAS on maternal folate, vitamin-B12 concentrations, maternal smoking, and pre-pregnancy BMI. The associations were directionally consistent with MEA being inversely associated with behaviours including smoking and BMI. Our findings form a bridge between socio-economic factors and biology and highlight potential pathways underlying effects of maternal education. The results broaden our understanding of bio-social associations linked to differential DNA methylation in multiple early stages of life. The data generated also offers an important resource to help a more precise understanding of the social determinants of health."

This pool of cells supports lifelong fertility in adult males by balancing self-renewal and differentiation to produce haploid gametes. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning long-term stemness of undifferentiated spermatogonia during adulthood remain unclear. Here, we discover that an epigenetic regulator, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), shields adult undifferentiated spermatogonia from differentiation, maintains slow cycling, and directs commitment to differentiation during steady-state spermatogenesis in adults. We show that PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 is an epigenetic hallmark of adult undifferentiated spermatogonia. Indeed, spermatogonial differentiation is accompanied by a global loss of H3K27me3. Disruption of PRC1 impairs global H3K27me3 deposition, leading to precocious spermatogonial differentiation. Therefore, PRC1 directs PRC2-H3K27me3 deposition to maintain the self-renewing state of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Importantly, in contrast to its role in other tissue stem cells, PRC1 negatively regulates the cell cycle to maintain slow cycling of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Our findings have implications for how epigenetic regulators can be tuned to regulate the stem cell potential, cell cycle&nbsp;and differentiation to ensure lifelong fertility in adult males."

"HACKMANN, Timothy J",New biochemical pathways for forming short-chain fatty acids during fermentation in rumen bacteria.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are essential to cattle as a source of energy and for other roles in metabolism. These molecules are formed during fermentation by microbes in the rumen, but even after decades of study, the biochemical pathways responsible for forming them are not always clear. Here we review recent advances in this area and their importance for improving animal productivity. Studies of bacterial genomes have pointed to unusual biochemical pathways in rumen organisms. One study found that 8% of rumen organisms forming acetate, a major SCFA, had genes for a pathway previously unknown in bacteria. The existence of this pathway was subsequently confirmed biochemically in propionibacteria. The pathway was shown to involve 2 enzymes that convert acetyl-coenzyme A to acetate. Similar studies have revealed new enzymatic steps for forming propionate and butyrate, other major SCFA. These new steps and pathways are significant for controlling fermentation. With more precise control over SCFA, cows can be fed more precisely and potentially reach higher productivity."

"BUGGS, Shani A",Risk and Protective Factors for Firearm Assault Injuries Among Black Men: A Scoping Review of Research.,"Black men are disproportionately affected by firearm assaults in the United States, and these disparities are rooted in structural and social inequities. The objective of this scoping review of research was to identify risk and protective factors for firearm assault injuries among Black men at all levels of the social-ecological framework. The search was conducted in 2021. The initial search generated 1,122 articles. Studies were eligible if they (a) included an analysis of modifiable risk or protective factors for firearm assaults among Black men; (b) reported an estimate of correlation, association, or effect between risk or protective factors and firearm assault injuries, firearm violence, and/or firearm homicides; and (c) were published peer-reviewed articles. In all, 19 articles were identified for review. Risk factors identified at each ecological level include the following: (1) Individual: firearm possession/weapon use and criminal legal system interaction; (2) Relationships: gang membership and exposure to other people who have experienced a firearm assault; (3) Community: indicators for socioeconomic status and racial residential segregation; and (4) Societal: historical racist policy. Individual-level substance use had mixed results. Few (26%) studies examined protective factors at any ecological level, but community-level factors like neighborhood tree cover were identified. Future research needs to examine risk and protective factors at the societal level and multiple ecological levels simultaneously leading to more effective multi-level interventions that will guide policy formation. A greater diversity of study designs, research methods, and theoretical frameworks is needed to better understand factors associated with firearm assault among Black men."

A phase&nbsp;II randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 22-week study of immediate-release (IR) ralinepag safety and efficacy met its primary endpoint, significantly reducing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) compared with placebo. This phase&nbsp;II open-label extension (OLE) study assessed long-term safety and tolerability of ralinepag. METHODS: Participants were eligible for the OLE if they completed the parent study or experienced a clinical worsening event while receiving placebo. Those previously receiving IR ralinepag remained on their current dose, and participants formerly administered placebo were titrated to the highest tolerated dose. Participants were transitioned to an extended-release ralinepag formulation toward the end of the OLE. The primary objective evaluated long-term safety and tolerability; secondary endpoints included changes in 6-min walk distance (6MWD), World Health Organization/New York Heart Association functional class, clinical worsening, and hemodynamic measures. RESULTS: In total, 45/61 participants enrolled in the OLE study, 30 from the IR ralinepag group and 15 from the placebo group. The most common adverse events (AEs) were known prostacyclin-related effects (e.g., headache, 64.4%; diarrhea, 37.8%; jaw pain, 33.3%). There was a notable decline in AEs after reaching and maintaining a stable dose. At month&nbsp;24 after entering the OLE, 6MWD significantly increased by a mean of 36.3&nbsp;m (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004) from OLE baseline, and most participants remained stable in their functional class (84.8%). Post-baseline PVR in 1 or 2&nbsp;years decreased by a median of 52.2&nbsp;dyn.s/cm5 and mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased by a median of 2.0&nbsp;mmHg (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.05). CONCLUSION: Ralinepag produced sustained, durable improvements in 6MWD along with durable reductions in PVR and a manageable AE profile. Most participants continuing treatment with ralinepag maintained functional measures throughout the OLE and those switching from placebo to ralinepag often experienced functional improvements."

"TANCREDI, Daniel J",Association between Opioid Overdose and Health Plan Disenrollment with Mitigating Impact of Buprenorphine Initiation.,"Context: Health plan disenrollment has been associated with higher mortality in patients with opioid use disorder. Insurance loss and health plan disenrollment might be downstream social consequences of opioid misuse and overdose that may heighten patient mortality risks during a period of heightened need for professional assistance. Objective: To test hypotheses that: 1) overdose events in patients prescribed long-term opioids are associated with subsequent health plan disenrollment; and 2) buprenorphine initiation after overdose would attenuate this association. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Dataset: Data from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse which includes de-identified medical and pharmacy claims and enrollment records for commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees. The database contains longitudinal health information on patients, representing a mixture of ages, ethnicities, and geographical regions across the United States. Population studied: Adults (aged â‰¥18 years) prescribed stable, opioid therapy for a 6-month baseline period (â‰¥90% of days covered, <10% monthly fluctuation from 6-month average, average daily dose â‰¥10 morphine milligram equivalents). Outcome Measures: Health plan disenrollment during up to one year of follow-up. Negative binomial regression estimated adjusted incidence rate ratios of disenrollment by incident overdose and buprenorphine initiation after overdose. Results: We identified 556,676 patients who were followed up after 1,119,100 stable periods of opioid therapy. During follow-up, 17.5% of person-periods ended in health plan disenrollment. Overdose events during follow-up were associated with health plan disenrollment with a dose-response relationship [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) for 1 overdose event = 1.29 (95% CI: 1.24-1.35); aIRR for â‰¥2 overdose events = 1.51 (1.43-1.59)]. Among patients with overdose events, subsequent buprenorphine initiation was associated with substantially reduced risk of health plan disenrollment [aIRR 0.36 (0.17-0.74)]. Conclusions: Overdose events in patients prescribed long-term opioids may portend other social consequences, such as health insurance loss, which may exacerbate patient risk at a time of heightened need and vulnerability. Buprenorphine may mitigate the risk of health plan disenrollment in opioid-prescribed patients who overdose."

We present a United States traveler with African tick bite fever 5 days after she returned from a mission trip to Zimbabwe. The patient exhibited symptomatic hypotension in addition to more typical findings, including fever, fatigue, and a necrotic eschar. The diagnosis was supported by histopathological findings and the patient's symptoms rapidly resolved with oral doxycycline therapy. We believe this case represents the first African tick bite fever diagnosis associated with symptomatic hypotension. This case additionally serves as a reminder of the importance of evaluating patient travel history."
"SHAHLAIE, Kiarash",Neuropathological Applications of Microscopy with Ultraviolet Surface Excitation (MUSE): A Concordance Study of Human Primary and Metastatic Brain Tumors,"Whereas traditional histology and light microscopy require multiple steps of formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, and sectioning to generate images for pathologic diagnosis, Microscopy using Ultraviolet Surface Excitation (MUSE) operates through UV excitation on the cut surface of tissue, generating images of high resolution without the need to fix or section tissue and allowing for potential use for downstream molecular tests. Here, we present the first study of the use and suitability of MUSE microscopy for neuropathological samples. MUSE images were generated from surgical biopsy samples of primary and metastatic brain tumor biopsy samples (n = 27), and blinded assessments of diagnoses, tumor grades, and cellular features were compared to corresponding hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) images. A set of MUSE-treated samples subsequently underwent exome and targeted sequencing, and quality metrics were compared to those from fresh frozen specimens. Diagnostic accuracy was relatively high, and DNA and RNA integrity appeared to be preserved for this cohort. This suggests that MUSE may be a reliable method of generating high-quality diagnostic-grade histologic images for neuropathology on a rapid and sample-sparing basis and for subsequent molecular analysis of DNA and RNA."

METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature published from 2000 to 2022 in PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. The inclusion criteria were: (1) focused on PLWD and/or family caregivers, (2) examined disparities or differences in healthcare, (3) were conducted in the United States, (4) compared two or more racial/ethnic groups, and (5) reported quantitative or qualitative findings. RESULTS: Key findings include accumulating evidence that minoritized populations are less likely to receive an accurate and timely diagnosis, be prescribed anti-dementia medications, and use hospice care, and more likely to have a&nbsp;higher risk of hospitalization and receive more aggressive life-sustaining treatment at the end-of-life. DISCUSSION: Future studies need to examine underlying processes and develop interventions to reduce disparities while also being more broadly inclusive of diverse populations."
"EERKENS, Jelmer W","Stable isotope chemistry reveals plant-dominant diet among early foragers on the Andean Altiplano, 9.0-6.5 cal. ka.","Current models of early human subsistence economies suggest a focus on large mammal hunting. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examine human bone stable isotope chemistry of 24 individuals from the early Holocene sites of Wilamaya Patjxa (9.0-8.7 cal. ka) and Soro Mikaya Patjxa (8.0-6.5 cal. ka) located at 3800 meters above sea level on the Andean Altiplano, Peru. Contrary to expectation, Bayesian mixing models based on the isotope chemistry reveal that plants dominated the diet, comprising 70-95% of the average diet. Paleoethnobotanical data further show that tubers may have been the most prominent subsistence resource. These findings update our understanding of earliest forager economies and the pathway to agricultural economies in the Andean highlands. The findings furthermore suggest that the initial subsistence economies of early human populations adapting to new landscapes may have been more plant oriented than current models suggest."
"CHEN, Xinbin",Ferredoxin 1 is essential for embryonic development and lipid homeostasis.,"Mammalian ferredoxin 1 and 2 (FDX1/2) belong to an evolutionary conserved family of iron-sulfur cluster containing proteins and act as electron shutters between ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) and numerous proteins involved in critical biological pathways. FDX1 is involved in biogenesis of steroids and bile acids, Vitamin A/D metabolism, and lipoylation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes. FDX1 has been extensively characterized biochemically but its role in physiology and lipid metabolism has not been explored. In this study, we generated Fdx1-deficient mice and showed that knockout of both alleles of the Fdx1 gene led to embryonic lethality. We also showed that like Fdxr+/-+/-, Fdx1+/-+/- had a shorter life span and were prone to steatohepatitis. However, unlike Fdxr+/-+/-, Fdx1+/-+/- were not prone to spontaneous tumors. Additionally, we showed that FDX1 deficiency led to lipid droplet accumulation possibly via the ABCA1-SREBP1/2 pathway. Specifically, untargeted lipidomic analysis showed that FDX1 deficiency led to alterations in several classes of lipids, including cholesterol, triacylglycerides, acylcarnitines, ceramides, phospholipids and lysophospholipids. Taken together, our data indicate that FDX1 is essential for mammalian embryonic development and lipid homeostasis at both cellular and organismal levels."
"LEIN, Pamela J",Cardiovascular responses of adult male Spragueâ€“Dawley rats following acute organophosphate intoxication and post-exposure treatment with midazolam with or without allopregnanolone,"Recent experimental evidence suggests combined treatment with midazolam and allopregnanolone is more effective than midazolam alone in terminating seizures triggered by acute organophosphate (OP) intoxication. However, there are concerns that combined midazolam and allopregnanolone increases risk of adverse cardiovascular events. To address this, we used telemetry devices to record cardiovascular responses in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats acutely intoxicated with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Animals were administered DFP (4&nbsp;mg/kg, sc), followed immediately by atropine (2&nbsp;mg/kg, i.m.) and 2-PAM (25&nbsp;mg/kg, i.m.). At 40&nbsp;min post-exposure, a subset of animals received midazolam (0.65&nbsp;mg/kg, im); at 50&nbsp;min, these rats received a second dose of midazolam or allopregnanolone (12&nbsp;mg/kg, im). DFP significantly increased blood pressure byâ€‰~â€‰80&nbsp;mmHg and pulse pressure byâ€‰~â€‰34&nbsp;mmHg that peaked within 12&nbsp;min. DFP also increased core temperature byâ€‰~â€‰3.5&nbsp;Â°C and heart rate byâ€‰~â€‰250&nbsp;bpm that peaked atâ€‰~â€‰2&nbsp;h. Heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic function, was reduced byâ€‰~â€‰80%. All acute (within 15&nbsp;min of exposure) and two-thirds of delayed (hours after exposure) mortalities were associated with non-ventricular cardiac events within 10&nbsp;min of cardiovascular collapse, suggesting that non-ventricular events should be closely monitored in OP-poisoned patients. Compared to rats that survived DFP intoxication without treatment, midazolam significantly improved recovery of cardiovascular parameters and HRV, an effect enhanced by allopregnanolone. These data demonstrate that midazolam improved recovery of cardiovascular and autonomic function and that the combination of midazolam and allopregnanolone may be a better therapeutic strategy than midazolam alone."

The HAT domain of p300/CBP is a potential drug target for cancer. Through compound screening and medicinal chemistry, novel inhibitors of p300/CBP HAT with their IC50 values as low as 620 nM were discovered. The most potent inhibitor is competitive against histone substrates and exhibits a high selectivity for p300/CBP. It inhibited cellular acetylation and had strong activity with EC50 of 1-3 Î¼M against proliferation of several tumor cell lines. Gene expression profiling in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer MCF-7 cells showed that inhibitor treatment recapitulated siRNA-mediated p300 knockdown, inhibited ER-mediated gene transcription, and suppressed expression of numerous cancer-related gene signatures. These results demonstrate that the inhibitor is not only a useful probe for biological studies of p300/CBP HAT but also a pharmacological lead for further drug development targeting cancer."

"MITSIADES, Nicholas",An epigenomic approach to therapy for tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.,"Tamoxifen has been a frontline treatment for estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±)-positive breast tumors in premenopausal women. However, resistance to tamoxifen occurs in many patients. ER still plays a critical role in the growth of breast cancer cells with acquired tamoxifen resistance, suggesting that ERÎ± remains a valid target for treatment of tamoxifen-resistant (Tam-R) breast cancer. In an effort to identify novel regulators of ERÎ± signaling, through a small-scale siRNA screen against histone methyl modifiers, we found WHSC1, a histone H3K36 methyltransferase, as a positive regulator of ERÎ± signaling in breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that WHSC1 is recruited to the ERÎ± gene by the BET protein BRD3/4, and facilitates ERÎ± gene expression. The small-molecule BET protein inhibitor JQ1 potently suppressed the classic ERÎ± signaling pathway and the growth of Tam-R breast cancer cells in culture. Using a Tam-R breast cancer xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated in vivo anti-breast cancer activity by JQ1 and a strong long-lasting effect of combination therapy with JQ1 and the ER degrader fulvestrant. Taken together, we provide evidence that the epigenomic proteins BRD3/4 and WHSC1 are essential regulators of estrogen receptor signaling and are novel therapeutic targets for treatment of Tam-R breast cancer."

Current (past-month) or ever tobacco and cannabis use was categorized as co-use, only tobacco or cannabis, or neither. Two self-reported educational outcomes were examined: absenteeism and grades. Adjusted logistic and linear regression models were used to examine the association between tobacco/cannabis use and absenteeism or grades, respectively. Estimates were adjusted for individual, peer, and school covariates, and clustering within schools.ResultsCurrent co-use of tobacco and cannabis was more than double the use of only tobacco (3.7% vs 1.7%) and similar to only cannabis (3.7%). Almost 18% of students reported absenteeism. Compared with students who used neither substance, students with current co-use had greater odds of absenteeism (aOR 1.41, 95% CI 1.33-1.49) and lower grades (Î²&nbsp;=&nbsp;-0.87, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.82). Compared with students using tobacco alone, students with co-use also had a significant elevated odds of absenteeism (aOR&nbsp;1.19, 95% CI 1.10-1.29) and lower grades (Î²&nbsp;=&nbsp;-0.39, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.32). Similar results were found for students who ever used tobacco and cannabis.ConclusionsCalifornia youth who co-use tobacco and cannabis were most likely to have absenteeism and lower grades. Comprehensive efforts to prevent or reduce youth substance use may improve educational outcomes."

Malnutrition is a predisposing factor, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that vitamin A deficiency, one of the most prevalent micronutrient deficits afflicting African children, increases susceptibility to disseminated non-typhoidal Salmonella disease in mice and impairs terminal neutrophil maturation. Immature neutrophils had reduced expression of Slc11a1, a gene that encodes a metal ion transporter generally thought to restrict pathogen growth in macrophages. Adoptive transfer of SLC11A1-proficient neutrophils, but not SLC11A1-deficient neutrophils, reduced systemic Salmonella burden in Slc11a1-/- mice or mice with vitamin A deficiency. Loss of terminal granulopoiesis regulator CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Ïµ (C/EBPÏµ) also decreased neutrophil-mediated control of Salmonella, but not that mediated by peritoneal macrophages. Susceptibility to infection increased in Cebpe-/- Slc11a1+/+ mice compared with wild-type controls, in an Slc11a1-expression-dependent manner. These data suggest that SLC11A1 deficiency impairs Salmonella control in part by blunting neutrophil-mediated defence."
"WILTGEN, Brian J",The hippocampus contributes to retroactive stimulus associations during trace fear conditioning,"Binding events that occur at different times are essential for memory formation. In trace fear conditioning, animals associate a tone and footshock despite no temporal overlap. The hippocampus is thought to mediate this learning by maintaining a memory of the tone until shock occurrence, however, evidence for sustained hippocampal tone representations is lacking. Here, we demonstrate a retrospective role for the hippocampus in trace fear conditioning. Bulk calcium imaging revealed sustained increases in CA1 activity after footshock that were not observed after tone termination. Optogenetic silencing of CA1 immediately after footshock impaired subsequent memory. Additionally, footshock increased the number of sharp-wave ripples compared to baseline during conditioning. Therefore, post-shock hippocampal activity likely supports learning by reactivating and linking latent tone and shock representations. These findings highlight an underappreciated function of post-trial hippocampal activity in enabling retroactive temporal associations during new learning, as opposed to persistent maintenance of stimulus representations."

Alignment is a crucial step in data processing pipelines, whereby LC-MS features derived from common ions are assembled into a unified matrix amenable to further analysis. Variability in the analytical factors that influence liquid chromatography separations complicates data alignment. This is prominent when aligning data acquired in different laboratories, generated using non-identical instruments, or between batches from large-scale studies. Previously, we developed metabCombiner for aligning disparately acquired LC-MS metabolomics datasets. Here, we report significant upgrades to metabCombiner that enable the stepwise alignment of multiple untargeted LC-MS metabolomics datasets, facilitating inter-laboratory reproducibility studies. To accomplish this, a ""primary"" feature list is used as a template for matching compounds in ""target"" feature lists. We demonstrate this workflow by aligning four lipidomics datasets from core laboratories generated using each institution's in-house LC-MS instrumentation and methods. We also introduce batchCombine, an application of the metabCombiner framework for aligning experiments composed of multiple batches. metabCombiner is available as an R package on Github and Bioconductor, along with a new online version implemented as an R Shiny App."

"ADAMS, Katherine P","Consumption of Discretionary Salt and Salt from Bouillon among Households, Women, and Young Children in Northern Region, Ghana: A Mixed-Methods Study with the Condiment Micronutrient Innovation Trial (CoMIT) Project.","BACKGROUND: Information on salt consumption patterns is needed to inform the need for and design of salt reduction strategies. OBJECTIVES: In northern Ghana, this study aimed to estimate household consumption of salt, including salt from bouillon, and compare (estimated) women and childrens salt intake to global recommendations; to estimate the proportion of salt consumed from bouillon; and to identify factors, including knowledge, attitudes, and practices, associated with household salt consumption. METHODS: Employing mixed-methods methodology, we conducted a pilot survey (n = 369 households enrolled) and focus group discussions (FGDs; n = 20) in Tolon and Kumbungu districts (14 urban, 14 rural clusters) (clinicaltrials.gov registry: NCT04632771). Households reported purchases of discretionary salt (DS, table salt) and bouillon cubes. DS and total salt (TS; DS+salt from bouillon) consumption for women (15-49 y) and children (2-5 y) were estimated using the Adult Male Equivalent method and compared with global recommendations (<5 g/d women; <3.75 g/d children). Womens salt intake was also predicted from urinary sodium excretion (INTERSALT equation). Associations between DS and TS consumption, as well as household and womens characteristics, were tested with minimally adjusted and multivariable linear mixed-effects models. Qualitative FGD themes were generated using the Framework Method. RESULTS: From household purchase data, estimated TS consumption exceeded global recommendations for 44% of children [median: 2.9 (IQR: 1.9, 5.2) g/d] and 60% of women [6.0 (4.0, 10.2) g/d]; 35% of children and 50% of women exceeded recommendations from DS alone. Bouillon contributed <25% of households TS consumption. Few characteristics were associated with DS or TS consumption. Salient qualitative themes that shaped salt consumption behaviors included salts ubiquity as a seasoning, key household members influence on food procurement and preparation, and perceptions about health. CONCLUSIONS: Purchase data suggest salt consumption among women and children exceeds recommendations, even when excluding salt from bouillon; food prepared outside the home likely further contributes. Salt reduction interventions may be warranted in this context."
"JEN, Kuang-Yu",Computational pathology model to assess acute and chronic transformations of the tubulointerstitial compartment in renal allograft biopsies.,"Managing patients with kidney allografts largely depends on biopsy diagnosis which is based on semiquantitative assessments of rejection features and extent of acute and chronic changes within the renal parenchyma. Current methods lack reproducibility while digital image data-driven computational models enable comprehensive and quantitative assays. In this study we aimed to develop a computational method for automated assessment of histopathology transformations within the tubulointerstitial compartment of the renal cortex. Whole slide images of modified Picrosirius red-stained biopsy slides were used for the training (nâ€‰=â€‰852) and both internal (nâ€‰=â€‰172) and external (nâ€‰=â€‰94) tests datasets. The pipeline utilizes deep learning segmentations of renal tubules, interstitium, and peritubular capillaries from which morphometry features were extracted. Seven indicators were selected for exploring the intrinsic spatial interactions within the tubulointerstitial compartment. A principal component analysis revealed two independent factors which can be interpreted as representing chronic and acute tubulointerstitial injury. A K-means clustering classified biopsies according to potential phenotypes of combined acute and chronic transformations of various degrees. We conclude that multivariate analyses of tubulointerstitial morphometry transformations enable extraction of and quantification of acute and chronic components of injury. The method is developed for renal allograft biopsies; however, the principle can be applied more broadly for kidney pathology assessment."

We aim to assess the efficacy and safety of HPSD versus SPLD for atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) retrieved from PubMed, WOS, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were performed through August 2023. We used RevMan V. 5.4 to pool dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). PROSPERO ID: CRD42023471797. RESULTS: We included six RCTs with a total of 694 patients. HPSD was significantly associated with a decreased total procedure time (MD: -22.88 with 95% CI [-36.13, -9.63], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0007), pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) time (MD: -19.73 with 95% CI [-23.93, -15.53], Pâ€‰<â€‰0.00001), radiofrequency time (MD: -10.53 with 95% CI [-12.87, -8.19], Pâ€‰<â€‰0.00001). However, there was no significant difference between HPSD and SPLD ablation with respect to the fluoroscopy time (MD: -0.69 with 95% CI [-2.00, 0.62], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.30), the incidence of esophageal lesions (RR: 1.15 with 95% CI [0.43, 3.07], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.77), and the incidence of first pass isolation (RR: 0.98 with 95% CI [0.88, 1.08], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.65). CONCLUSION: HPSD ablation was significantly associated with decreased total procedure time, PVI time, and radiofrequency time compared with SPLD ablation. On the contrary, SPLD ablation was significantly associated with low maximum temperature."

Then, all patients received netarsudil for the next 4 or 8&nbsp;months. Complete ophthalmic examination, ultrasonic pachymetry, Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography, and in vivo confocal microscopy were performed at baseline and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12&nbsp;months. Effect of netarsudil on central corneal thickness (CCT), percentage of cornea with edema, and endothelial cell density (ECD) were evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test were used to compare corneal edema and clinical progression of eyes in netarsudil versus vehicle control groups. All dogs developed conjunctival hyperemia in at least one eye while receiving netarsudil. Unilateral transient reticulated intraepithelial bullae and stromal hemorrhage were observed respectively in 2 dogs in the netarsudil group. Two dogs showed persistently decreased tear production while receiving netarsudil, requiring topical immunomodulatory treatment. No significant differences in CCT, ECD, corneal edema or clinical progression were observed between netarsudil or vehicle treated eyes. When comparing efficacy of topical netarsudil BID and topical ripasudil 0.4% administered four times daily from our previous study, dogs receiving ripasudil had significantly less progression than those receiving netarsudil."

To clarify the function of the REVEILLE 4, REVEILLE 6, and REVEILLE 8 transcriptional activators, we characterized the growth and clock phenotypes of CRISPR-Cas9-generated single, double, and triple rve mutants. We found that these genes act synergistically to regulate flowering time, redundantly to regulate leaf growth, and antagonistically to regulate hypocotyl elongation. We previously reported that increasing intensities of monochromatic blue and red light have opposite effects on the period of triple rve468 mutants. Here, we further examined light quality-specific phenotypes of rve mutants and report that rve468 mutants lack the blue light-specific increase in expression of some circadian clock genes observed in wild type. To investigate the basis of these blue light-specific circadian phenotypes, we examined RVE protein abundances and degradation rates in blue and red light and found no significant differences between these conditions. We next examined genetic interactions between RVE genes and ZEITLUPE and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5, two factors with blue light-specific functions in the clock. We found that the RVEs interact additively with both ZEITLUPE and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 to regulate circadian period, which suggests that neither of these factors are required for the blue light-specific differences that we observed. Overall, our results suggest that the RVEs have separable functions in plant growth and circadian regulation and that they are involved in blue light-specific circadian signaling via a novel mechanism."

Maximum axial thrust force, maximum drill torque, integral of force and displacement, change in temperature, maximum power spectral density of the torque signal, torque vibration, and torque and angle at the yield and failure points were collected. Pre- and postyield stiffness, yield and failure energies, and postyield energy were calculated.ResultsThe work required to drill through the cis- and transcortices (integral of force and displacement) was greater for the K-wire, followed by the acrylic and then standard drill bits, respectively. The K-wire demonstrated higher maximum torque than the drill bits at the ciscortex, and the force of drilling was significantly greater. The vibration data was greater with the acrylic and standard drill bits than the K-wire. There was no difference in torsional strength between drilling types.Clinical relevanceMechanical differences exist between different drill bits and K-wire and demonstrate that the K-wire is overall more damaging than the surgical drill bit."
"KULKARNI, Ambarish","Reduction of Cofed Carbon Dioxide Modifies the Local Coordination Environment of Zeolite-Supported, Atomically Dispersed Chromium to Promote Ethane Dehydrogenation.","The reduction of CO2 is known to promote increased alkene yields from alkane dehydrogenations when the reactions are cocatalyzed. The mechanism of this promotion is not understood in the context of catalyst active-site environments because CO2 is amphoteric, and even general aspects of the chemistry, including the significance of competing side reactions, differ significantly across catalysts. Atomically dispersed chromium cations stabilized in highly siliceous MFI zeolite are shown here to enable the study of the role of parallel CO2 reduction during ethylene-selective ethane dehydrogenation. Based on infrared spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy data interpreted through calculations using density functional theory (DFT), the synthesized catalyst contains atomically dispersed Cr cations stabilized by silanol nests in micropores. Reactor studies show that cofeeding CO2 increases stable ethylene-selective ethane dehydrogenation rates over a wide range of partial pressures. Operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) spectra indicate that during reaction at 650 Â°C the Cr cations maintain a nominal 2+ charge and a total Cr-O coordination number of approximately 2. However, CO2 reduction induces a change, correlated with the CO2 partial pressure, in the population of two distinct Cr-O scattering paths. This indicates that the promotional effect of parallel CO2 reduction can be attributed to a subtle change in Cr-O bond lengths in the local coordination environment of the active site. These insights are made possible by simultaneously fitting multiple EXAFS spectra recorded in different reaction conditions; this novel procedure is expected to be generally applicable for interpreting operando catalysis EXAFS data."

"POURREZA, Alireza",Clustering symptomatic pixels in broomrape-infected carrots facilitates targeted evaluations of alterations in host primary plant traits,"In this study, we explore spectral heterogeneity within plant canopies, a characteristic often observed in stressed plants where certain leaves or intra-leaf regions exhibit stress symptoms while others remain unaffected. Considering this variability in spectral signatures holds promise for enhancing remote sensing methodologies aimed at plant stress detection. Typically, remote sensing techniques analyze the plant as a whole, potentially overlooking stress-related spectral signatures due to the inclusion of unaffected pixels. We used a clustering-based technique, which incorporates semi-supervised learning elements for tuning hyper-parameters, to differentiate spectral patterns associated with and unique to pixels from broomrape-infected (Orobanche spp. and Phelipanche spp.) carrots from unrelated patterns. Ground-based hyperspectral (400â€“1000 nm) images of broomrape-infected and non-infected carrot canopies were used in an agglomerative clustering procedure followed by spectral angle mapper (SAM) analysis to identify a spectral endmember indicative of broomrape infection symptoms. Pixels from this cluster constituted an average of 8.5â€“11.5 % from the canopies of infected plants. Subsequently, we: (a) examined the relationship between carrot leaf mineral content and the percentage of symptomatic pixels to explore stress-induced alterations creating the unique spectral signatures of infected plants; and (b) utilized the inverse mode of PROSPECT, a radiative transfer model (RTM), to derive primary plant traits from the distinct spectral data of each cluster. We found that deficits in two macro elements, phosphorous and potassium, along with two pigments, chlorophyll and carotenoid, were correlated with the symptomatic cluster in infected plants. The methodology presented in this study paves the way for further research into broomrape detection in various crop species, as well as other plant stressors."

"HARVEY, John T",Field Aging and Binder Fatigue Performance of Intermediate Asphalt Concrete Layers Containing Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement,"In this research, field slab samples were taken from an asphalt pavement in a hot climate with a design life of 40â€‰years at 2, 4, and 7â€‰years of pavement age to determine aging behavior with time at different depths. The asphalt binders were extracted and recovered to evaluate the aging and fatigue performance of the intermediate layer of the asphalt pavement. The chemical and rheological aging properties of the binders were evaluated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and a dynamic shear rheometer, respectively. The pavement included 25â€‰mm (1â€‰in.) open-graded and 75â€‰mm (2â€‰in.) polymer-modified layers over three intermediate layer lifts. The intermediate layer aging is mostly governed by the connecting air voids and binder content of the asphalt mixes. The variation in aging deeper than 100â€‰mm (4â€‰in.) below the pavement surface was minor because of the absence of heat and access to air, with similar aging parameter values observed for different years of field sampling indicating little to no aging after construction. A good correlation ( R2 values of 0.79â€“0.92) was observed between the chemical property (carbonyl index) and rheological properties of the extracted binder for the dense-graded asphalt concrete layers between 25 and 100â€‰mm depths. The fatigue performance of these extracted binders was evaluated by performing linear amplitude sweep tests. The results indicate that binder fatigue performance initially improved with moderate levels of aging but started to decline under extreme aging conditions."
"CHERTOK, Maxwell B",Search for supersymmetry in final states with disappearing tracks in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV,"A search is presented for charged, long-lived supersymmetric particles in final states with one or more disappearing tracks. The search is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC between 2016 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of Formula Presented. The search is performed over final states characterized by varying numbers of jets, Formula Presented-tagged jets, electrons, and muons. The length of signal-candidate tracks in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis is used to characterize the lifetimes of wino- and Higgsino-like charginos produced in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. The Formula Presented energy loss of signal-candidate tracks is used to increase the sensitivity to charginos with a large mass and thus a small Lorentz boost. The observed results are found to be statistically consistent with the background-only hypothesis. Limits on the pair-production cross section of gluinos and squarks are presented in the framework of simplified models of supersymmetric particle production and decay, and for electroweakino production based on models of wino and Higgsino dark matter. The limits presented are the most stringent to date for scenarios with light third-generation squarks and a wino- or Higgsino-like dark matter candidate capable of explaining the observed dark matter relic density."

"PANDEY, Pramod K",Quantitative Analysis of Genomic DNA Degradation of E. coli Using Automated Gel Electrophoresis under Various Levels of Microwave Exposure.,"The problem that this study addresses is to understand how microwave radiation is able to degrade genomic DNA of E. coli. In addition, a comparative study was made to evaluate the suitability of a high-throughput automated electrophoresis platform for quantifying the DNA degradation under microwave radiation. Overall, this study investigated the genomic DNA degradation of E. coli under microwave radiation using automated gel electrophoresis. To examine the viable organisms and degradation of genomic DNA under microwave exposure, we used three methods: (1) post-microwave exposure, where E. coli was enumerated using modified mTEC agar method using membrane filtration technique; (2) extracted genomic DNA of microwaved sample was quantified using the Qubit method; and (3) automated gel electrophoresis, the TapeStation 4200, was used to examine the bands of extracted DNA of microwaved samples. In addition, to examine the impacts of microwaves, E. coli colonies were isolated from a fecal sample (dairy cow manure), these colonies were grown overnight to prepare fresh E. coli culture, and this culture was exposed to microwave radiation for three durations: (1) 2 min; (2) 5 min; and (3) 8 min. In general, Qubit values (ng/ÂµL) were proportional to the results of automated gel electrophoresis, TapeStation 4200, DNA integrity numbers (DINs). Samples from exposure studies (2 min, 5 min, and 8 min) showed no viable E. coli. Initial E. coli levels (at 0 min microwave exposure) were 5 Ã— 108 CFU/mL, and the E. coli level was reduced to a non-detectable level within 2 min of microwave exposure. The relationships between Qubit and TapeStation measurements was linear, except for when the DNA level was lower than 2 ng/ÂµL. In 8 min of microwave exposure, E. coli DNA integrity was reduced by 61.7%, and DNA concentration was reduced by 81.6%. The overall conclusion of this study is that microwave radiation had a significant impact on the genomic DNA of E. coli, and prolonged exposure of E. coli to microwaves can thus lead to a loss of genomic DNA integrity and DNA concentrations."

In this study, we examine glycemic control in relation to cognitive aging and impairment in a large prospective cohort of middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals of diverse heritages.Research design and methodsStudy of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) is a Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) ancillary study. HCHS/SOL is a multisite (Bronx, NY; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; and San Diego, CA), probability sampled prospective cohort study. SOL-INCA enrolled 6,377 diverse Hispanic/Latino individuals aged 50 years and older (2016-2018). The primary outcomes were cognitive function, 7-year cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The primary glycemia exposure variables were measured from fasting blood samples collected at HCHS/SOL visit 1 (2008-2011).ResultsVisit 1 mean age was 56.5 years Â± 8.2 SD, and the average glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) was 6.12% (43.5 Â± 14.6 mmol/mol). After covariate adjustment, higher HbA1c was associated with accelerated 7-year global (b = -0.045; 95% CI -0.070; -0.021; in z score units) and executive cognitive decline and a higher prevalence of MCI (odds ratio 1.20; 95% CI 1.11; 1.29).ConclusionsElevated HbA1c levels were associated with 7-year executive cognitive decline and increased MCI risk among diverse middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals. Our findings indicate that poor glycemic control in midlife may pose significant risks for cognitive decline and MCI later in life among Hispanic/Latino individuals of diverse heritages."

This meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) aimed to determine whether RIC improves graft function after kidney transplantation.MethodsA comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases until June 20, 2023, to identify all randomized controlled trials that examined the impact of RIC on graft function after kidney transplantation. The primary outcome was the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) post-kidney transplantation. The secondary outcomes included the incidence of acute rejection, graft loss, 3- and 12-month estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR), and the length of hospital stay. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on RIC procedures (preconditioning, perconditioning, or postconditioning), implementation sites (upper or lower extremity), and graft source (living or deceased donor).ResultsOur meta-analysis included eight trials involving 1038 patients. Compared with the control, RIC did not significantly reduce the incidence of DGF (8.8% vs. 15.3%; risk ratioâ€‰=â€‰0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-1.21, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.25, I2â€‰=â€‰16%), and TSA results showed that the required information size was not reached. However, the RIC group had a significantly increased eGFR at 3 months after transplantation (mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰2.74&nbsp;ml/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI: 1.44-4.05&nbsp;ml/min/1.73 m2, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001, I2â€‰=â€‰0%), with a sufficient evidence suggested by TSA. The secondary outcomes were comparable between the other secondary outcomes. The treatment effect of RIC did not differ between the subgroup analyses.ConclusionIn this meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis, RIC did not lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of DGF after kidney transplantation. Nonetheless, RIC demonstrated a positive correlation with 3-month eGFR. Given the limited number of patients included in this study, well-designed clinical trials with large sample sizes are required to validate the renoprotective benefits of RIC.Trial registrationThis systematic review and meta-analysis was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (Number CRD42023464447)."

This requires physical compounds, which limits coverage of accessible chemical space. Computational approaches combined with vast on-demand chemical libraries can access far greater chemical space, provided that the predictive accuracy is sufficient to identify useful molecules. Through the largest and most diverse virtual HTS campaign reported to date, comprising 318 individual projects, we demonstrate that our AtomNetÂ® convolutional neural network successfully finds novel hits across every major therapeutic area and protein class. We address historical limitations of computational screening by demonstrating success for target proteins without known binders, high-quality X-ray crystal structures, or manual cherry-picking of compounds. We show that the molecules selected by the AtomNetÂ® model are novel drug-like scaffolds rather than minor modifications to known bioactive compounds. Our empirical results suggest that computational methods can substantially replace HTS as the first step of small-molecule drug discovery."
"SUN, Gang",Effects of Tantalum Doping on Friction and Corrosion Behavior of Multilayer Ta-DLC Films,"Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are widely applied in material protection due to high hardness, excellent wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. To solve the problem that 316L stainless steel is prone to wear and corrosion in the environment of marine friction and corrosion, Ta/TaN/TaCN/Ta-DLC films were deposited on 316L stainless steel by mid-frequency magnetron sputtering technology. The surface morphology, cross-sectional morphology, and corrosion morphology of the prepared films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) were used to analyze the electronic structure of carbon element, chemical bond information, and phase composition in DLC films, respectively. The tribological and mechanical properties were tested by scratch method, nanoindentation test, and friction and wear test. The corrosion resistance of the films was tested by the electrochemical method. The effect of Ta element content in DLC film on the structure, composition, mechanical properties, tribological properties and corrosion resistance of the film was studied. The results showed that all films had a smooth surface and small surface cluster particles. When the doping content of Ta element was 2.04at.%, there were defects on the surface of the film. With the content of Ta element increased from 2.04at.% to 4.16at.%, the sp3 carbon in the film showed a trend of firstly increasing and then decreasing. The content of sp3 carbon in the film was the highest when the Ta content was 3.60at.%. The Ta element was mainly present in the forms of TaO and TaC in the surface DLC layer. Ta doping had little effect on film adhesion, and the adhesion of all films was about 10 N. When the Ta element doping content was 2.04at.%, the adhesion decreased slightly due to obvious defects in the film. With the increase of the doping content of Ta element in the Ta-DLC layer, the nano-hardness and elastic modulus of the films showed a trend of firstly increasing and then decreasing, which was consistent with the changing trend of sp3 carbon content in the Ta-DLC film, indicating that the change of carbon electronic structure in the Ta-DLC film layer played a major role in the nano-hardness of the film. The average friction coefficient of 316L stainless steel was 0.87, and the friction coefficient of the prepared film was generally between 0.21-0.43. Under the action of low load, the film had a good protective effect on 316L stainless steel. In addition, with the increase of the Ta element content, the average friction coefficient of the films gradually decreased, reaching a minimum of 0.21 at 4.16at.%. When the Ta element content was 3.60at.%, the corrosion current density and passivation current density of the film were 0.006 Î¼A/cm2 and 0.63 Î¼A/cm2, respectively, which were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than other films, and its film resistance and charge transfer resistance were the largest, showing the most excellent corrosion resistance. In short, the doping of the Ta element improves the friction resistance of Ta/TaN/TaCN/Ta-DLC film, and the appropriate doping amount of the Ta element can improve the wear resistance and corrosion resistance of Ta/TaN/TaCN/Ta-DLC film."

Timely and accurate equipment malfunction identification can be a key to success. It is also desirable to predict malfunctions well in advance of their actual occurrence. In this paper, we use neural networks to model time series data extracted from a three-step plasma etch process for defining active areas in a CMOS ASIC circuit. The data consists of real-time measurements from the three-step etch process for 140,000 silicon wafers collected over a six-month period from a Drytek plasma etcher. Two types of anomalies were present in this data: 1 ) a constant or slowly advancing process signal (indicating the presence of a machine fault); and 2) missing steps (indicating something unexpected happened during the etch). Data pre-processing is carried out to eliminate any data acquisition errors in the original data and to correctly separate the total time sequence into three sub-sequences (one for each etch step). A pattern recognition technique is used to determine the process step number for each record. The classification results and the prediction error demonstrate accurate determination of the etch step number from the chamber state. Dynamic neural network models are then constructed for each step. We initially focus on modeling the time series associated with chamber pressure. The time series of pressure data is modeled as a function of its previous values and the current time. We use this approach to construct time series models of the pressure variations in the etching system using only an initial condition and the time value as inputs."

In approximately the 8th decade of life reinnervation no longer keeps pace, resulting in the accumulation of persistently denervated muscle fibers that in turn cause an acceleration of muscle dysfunction. The significance of denervation in important clinical outcomes with aging is poorly studied. The Study of Muscle, Mobility, and Aging (SOMMA) is a large cohort study with the primary objective to assess how aging muscle biology impacts clinically important traits. Using transcriptomics data from vastus lateralis muscle biopsies in 575 participants we have selected 49 denervation-responsive genes to provide insights to the burden of denervation in SOMMA, to test the hypothesis that greater expression of denervation-responsive genes negatively associates with SOMMA participant traits that included time to walk 400 meters, fitness (VO2peak), maximal mitochondrial respiration, muscle mass and volume, and leg muscle strength and power. Consistent with our hypothesis, increased transcript levels of: a calciumdependent intercellular adhesion glycoprotein (CDH15), acetylcholine receptor subunits (CHRNA1, CHRND, CHRNE), a glycoprotein promoting reinnervation (NCAM1), a transcription factor regulating aspects of muscle organization (RUNX1), and a sodium channel (SCN5A) were each negatively associated with at least 3 of these traits. VO2peak and maximal respiration had the strongest negative associations with 15 and 19 denervation-responsive genes, respectively. In conclusion, the abundance of denervationresponsive gene transcripts is a significant determinant of muscle and mobility outcomes in aging humans, supporting the imperative to identify new treatment strategies to restore innervation in advanced age."

By combining rhesus and human allele frequencies with established variant prediction methods, we develop a machine learning-based score that outperforms established methods in predicting missense variant pathogenicity. Remarkably, we find a marked number of loss-of-function variants and putative deleterious variants, which may lead to the development of rhesus disease models.

METHODS: Among 171,964 people with type 2 diabetes, we evaluated the hazard of dementia association with long-term HbA1c variability using five operationalizations, including standard deviation (SD), adjusting for demographics and comorbidities. RESULTS: The mean baseline age was 61 years (48% women). Greater HbA1c SD was associated with greater dementia hazard (adjusted hazard ratio&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.15 [95% confidence interval: 1.12, 1.17]). In stratified analyses, higher HbA1c SD quintiles were associated with greater dementia hazard among those with a mean HbA1c&nbsp;<&nbsp;6% (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0004) or 6% to 8% (P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.0001) but not among those with mean HbA1c â‰¥ 8% (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.42). DISCUSSION: Greater HbA1c variability is associated with greater dementia risk, even among those with HbA1c concentrations at ideal clinical targets. These findings add to the importance and clinical impact of recommendations to minimize glycemic variability. HIGHLIGHTS: We observed a cohort of 171,964 people with type 2 diabetes (mean age 61 years). This cohort was based in Northern California between 1996 and 2018. We examined the association between glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) variability and dementia risk. Greater HbA1c variability was associated with greater dementia hazard. This was most evident among those with normal-low mean HbA1c concentrations."

"EBONG, Imo A",The Role of Psychosocial Stress on Cardiovascular Disease in Women: JACC State-of-the-Art Review.,"Psychosocial stress can affect cardiovascular health through multiple pathways. Certain stressors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage, childhood adversity, intimate partner violence, and caregiving stress, are especially common among women. The consequences of stress begin at a young age and persist throughout the life course. This is especially true for women, among whom the burden of negative psychosocial experiences tends to be larger in young age and midlife. Menarche, pregnancy, and menopause can further exacerbate stress in vulnerable women. Not only is psychosocial adversity prevalent in women, but it could have more pronounced consequences for cardiovascular risk among women than among men. These differential effects could reside in sex differences in responses to stress, combined with womens propensity toward vasomotor reactivity, microvascular dysfunction, and inflammation. The bulk of evidence suggests that targeting stress could be an important strategy for cardiovascular risk reduction in women."
"NICKLISCH, Sascha C",From primers to pipettes: An immersive course introducing high school students to qPCR for quantifying chemical defense gene expression,"We created a 2-week, dual-module summer course introducing high school students to environmental toxicology by teaching them quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as a way to quantify gene expression of chemical defense proteins in response to exposure to environmental pollutants. During the course, students are guided through the various stages of a successful qPCR experiment: in silico primer design and quality control, total RNA extraction and isolation, cDNA conversion, primer test PCR, and evaluation of results via agarose gel electrophoresis or UV/Vis spectra. The course combines lectures, discussions, and demonstrations with dry and wet laboratory sections to give students a thorough understanding of the scope, utility, and chemical principles of qPCR. At the end of the course, the students are taught how to analyze qPCR data and are encouraged to discuss their findings with other classmates to evaluate their hypotheses and assess possible sources of error. This course was designed to be easily adaptable to multiple test species, chemical exposures, and genes of interest. To explore both terrestrial and aquatic toxicology, the students use honey bees (Apis mellifera) and mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) as test organisms, as well as ABC-type efflux transporters, antioxidant enzymes, and cytochrome P450 enzymes as endpoints for assessing gene expression. We share this course setup and applied protocols to encourage others to design and offer similar courses that give high school students a hands-on introduction to a broad swath of environmental toxicology research and an opportunity to develop scientific skills necessary for university-level research."

"HAMMOCK, Bruce",Evaluation of the Immune Response of Patulin by Proteomics.,"Patulin, an emerging mycotoxin with high toxicity, poses great risks to public health. Considering the poor antibody production in patulin immunization, this study focuses on the four-dimensional data-independent acquisition (4D-DIA) quantitative proteomics to reveal the immune response of patulin in rabbits. The rabbit immunization was performed with the complete developed antigens of patulin, followed by the identification of the immune serum. A total of 554 differential proteins, including 292 up-regulated proteins and 262 down-regulated proteins, were screened; the differential proteins were annotated; and functional enrichment analysis was performed. The differential proteins were associated with the pathways of metabolism, gene information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes, and organismal systems. The functional enrichment analysis indicated that the immunization procedures mostly resulted in the regulation of biochemical metabolic and signal transduction pathways, including the biosynthesis of amino acid (glycine, serine, and threonine), ascorbate, and aldarate metabolism; fatty acid degradation; and antigen processing and presentation. The 14 key proteins with high connectivity included G1U9T1, B6V9S9, G1SCN8, G1TMS5, G1U9U0, A0A0G2JH20, G1SR03, A0A5F9DAT4, G1SSA2, G1SZ14, G1T670, P30947, P29694, and A0A5F9C804, which were obtained by the analysis of protein-protein interaction networks. This study could provide potential directions for protein interaction and antibody production for food hazards in animal immunization."

"URAYAMA, Shiro",Eosinophilic cholangitis: A case report of diagnostically challenging eosinophilic infiltrative biliary obstruction.,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of biliary strictures primarily focuses on ruling out malignancy in older age groups. With endoscopic tools such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and cholangioscopy, improved biliary visualization has enhanced the investigation of intraluminal biliary lesions and provided modalities for targeted biopsies. Benign biliary strictures, however, may pose a diagnostic dilemma. CASE SUMMARY: A 71-year-old female with past medial history of hypothyroidism presenting for abnormal biliary imaging. Patients previous evaluation was concerning for common bile duct dilation with cholelithiasis, for which she underwent a cholecystectomy. Due to persistent symptoms and worsening liver function tests, she presented to our institution for further workup. Subsequently, the patient underwent an EUS and multiple ERCPs with cholangioscopy; biliary biopsies revealed no evidence of malignancy but concerning for prominent eosinophilic infiltration. After further review of multiple pathology specimens and the benign clinical course, we diagnosed the patient with eosinophilic cholangitis. CONCLUSION: Eosinophilic cholangitis is a rare disease and can present as a challenging case diagnostically. This case raises the potential utility of quantitative eosinophilic infiltration reporting in creating an objective diagnostic metric for eosinophilic cholangitis."

"SEN, Fatma",The role of brown adipose tissue in branched-chain amino acid clearance in people,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) in rodents appears to be an important tissue for the clearance of plasma branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) contributing to improved metabolic health. However, the role of human BAT in plasma BCAA clearance is poorly understood. Here, we evaluate patients with prostate cancer who underwent positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging after an injection of 18F-fluciclovine (L-leucine analog). Supraclavicular adipose tissue (AT; primary location of human BAT) has a higher net uptake rate for 18F-fluciclovine compared to subcutaneous abdominal and upper chest AT. Supraclavicular AT 18F-fluciclovine net uptake rate is lower in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Finally, the expression of genes involved in BCAA catabolism is higher in the supraclavicular AT of healthy people with high BAT volume compared to those with low BAT volume. These findings support the notion that BAT can potentially function as a metabolic sink for plasma BCAA clearance in people."

"ZHOU, Huaijun",Genotypic and phenotypic characterisation of three local chicken ecotypes of Ghana based on principal component analysis and body measurements.,"This study aimed to characterise three Ghanaian local chicken ecotypes, namely, Interior Savannah, Forest, and Coastal Savannah, based on morphological data and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes. Morphological data including body weight, shank length, body girth, back length, thigh length, beak length, comb length, and wattle length were collected from 250 local chickens. DNA isolated from blood of 1,440 local chickens was used for SNP genotyping with the Affymetrix chicken 600k SNP chip. Principal component analysis showed that Forest and Coastal Savannah birds were closely related. Generally, all three ecotypes exhibited high genetic diversity, especially birds from the Interior Savannah zone. Morphological characterisation showed that ecotype (p = 0.016) and sex (p = 0.000) had significant effects on body weight. Birds of the Interior Savannah ecotype were the heaviest (p = 0.004), with mean weights of 1.23 kg for females and 1.40 kg for males. Sex also had a strong significant effect on most of the morphological measurements, but the sex * ecotype interaction effect was not significant. Very few of the feather phenotypes previously reported to be associated with heat resistance-frizzle (2%) and naked neck (1.6%)-were found in the studied populations. It is concluded that the three local ecotypes are genetically diverse but with similar morphological features and the information provided would be useful for future selection decisions."

"SHAHLAIE, Kiarash",An Accurate and Rapidly Calibrating Speech Neuroprosthesis,"BackgroundBrain-computer interfaces can enable communication for people with paralysis by transforming cortical activity associated with attempted speech into text on a computer screen. Communication with brain-computer interfaces has been restricted by extensive training requirements and limited accuracy.MethodsA 45-year-old man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with tetraparesis and severe dysarthria underwent surgical implantation of four microelectrode arrays into his left ventral precentral gyrus 5 years after the onset of the illness; these arrays recorded neural activity from 256 intracortical electrodes. We report the results of decoding his cortical neural activity as he attempted to speak in both prompted and unstructured conversational contexts. Decoded words were displayed on a screen and then vocalized with the use of text-to-speech software designed to sound like his pre-ALS voice.ResultsOn the first day of use (25 days after surgery), the neuroprosthesis achieved 99.6% accuracy with a 50-word vocabulary. Calibration of the neuroprosthesis required 30 minutes of cortical recordings while the participant attempted to speak, followed by subsequent processing. On the second day, after 1.4 additional hours of system training, the neuroprosthesis achieved 90.2% accuracy using a 125,000-word vocabulary. With further training data, the neuroprosthesis sustained 97.5% accuracy over a period of 8.4 months after surgical implantation, and the participant used it to communicate in self-paced conversations at a rate of approximately 32 words per minute for more than 248 cumulative hours.ConclusionsIn a person with ALS and severe dysarthria, an intracortical speech neuroprosthesis reached a level of performance suitable to restore conversational communication after brief training.

"CHIU, Joanna C",Transcriptome analysis of Drosophila suzukii reveals molecular mechanisms conferring pyrethroid and spinosad resistance.,"Drosophila suzukii lay eggs in soft-skinned, ripening fruits, making this insect a serious threat to berry production. Since its 2008 introduction into North America, growers have used insecticides, such as pyrethroids and spinosads, as the primary approach for D. suzukii management, resulting in development of insecticide resistance in this pest. This study sought to identify the molecular mechanisms conferring insecticide resistance in these populations. We sequenced the transcriptomes of two pyrethroid- and two spinosad-resistant isofemale lines. In both pyrethroid-resistant lines and one spinosad-resistant line, we identified overexpression of metabolic genes that are implicated in resistance in other insect pests. In the other spinosad-resistant line, we observed an overexpression of cuticular genes that have been linked to resistance. Our findings enabled the development of molecular diagnostics that we used to confirm persistence of insecticide resistance in California, U.S.A. To validate these findings, we leveraged D. melanogaster mutants with reduced expression of metabolic or cuticular genes that were found to be upregulated in resistant D. suzukii to demonstrate that these genes are involved in promoting resistance. This study is the first to characterize the molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance in D. suzukii and provides insights into how current management practices can be optimized."
"VANNETTE, Rachel",Targeted viromes and total metagenomes capture distinct components of bee gut phage communities.,"BACKGROUND: Despite being among the most abundant biological entities on earth, bacteriophage (phage) remain an understudied component of host-associated systems. One limitation to studying host-associated phage is the lack of consensus on methods for sampling phage communities. Here, we compare paired total metagenomes and viral size fraction metagenomes (viromes) as methods for investigating the dsDNA viral communities associated with the GI tract of two bee species: the European honey bee Apis mellifera and the eastern bumble bee Bombus impatiens. RESULTS: We find that viromes successfully enriched for phage, thereby increasing phage recovery, but only in honey bees. In contrast, for bumble bees, total metagenomes recovered greater phage diversity. Across both bee species, viromes better sampled low occupancy phage, while total metagenomes were biased towards sampling temperate phage. Additionally, many of the phage captured by total metagenomes were absent altogether from viromes. Comparing between bees, we show that phage communities in commercially reared bumble bees are significantly reduced in diversity compared to honey bees, likely reflecting differences in bacterial titer and diversity. In a broader context, these results highlight the complementary nature of total metagenomes and targeted viromes, especially when applied to host-associated environments. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we suggest that studies interested in assessing total communities of host-associated phage should consider using both approaches. However, given the constraints of virome sampling, total metagenomes may serve to sample phage communities with the understanding that they will preferentially sample dominant and temperate phage.

In-feed antibioticsÂ as growth promoters have been banned dueÂ to the increasing concern of antimicrobial resistance. Seaweeds offer bioactive molecules with antibacterial and antioxidant properties. The aim was to estimate the in vitro properties of seaweed extracts: Ascophyllum nodosum (AN), Palmaria palmata (PP), Ulva lactuca (UL), and 1:1 mixes (ANPP, ANUL, PPUL). Escherichia coli strains were used to test for growth inhibitory activity, and chemical-based assays were performed for antioxidant properties. The treatments were 2 (with/without Escherichia coli)â€‰Ã—â€‰2 (F4â€‰+â€‰and F18â€‰+)â€‰Ã—â€‰5 doses (0, 1.44, 2.87, 5.75, 11.50, and 23.0Â mg/mL). Bacteria were supplemented with seaweed extracts, and growth was monitored. The antioxidant activity was assessed with 6 doses (0, 1, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 600Â mg/mL)â€‰Ã—â€‰6 compounds using two chemical assays. Data were evaluated through SAS. The results showed that AN and UL significantly inhibited (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) the growth of F4â€‰+â€‰and F18â€‰+. PP and mixes did not display an inhibition of the bacteria growth. AN, PP, UL extracts, and mixes exhibited antioxidant activities, with AN showing the strongest dose-response. Thus, AN and UL seaweed extracts reveal promising antibacterial and antioxidant effects and may be candidates for in-feed additives."
